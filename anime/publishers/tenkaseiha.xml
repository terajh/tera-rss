      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; And punching children. Impressions: Can&amp;#39;t say it was the most interesting episode, and it feels particularly weird that they&amp;#39;re not just throwing Teoritta in a box somewhere for the entire affair, but she&amp;#39;s seemingly not making any kind of commotion about it. Or appearing in the episode at all aside from taking a nap [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; At least she almost got a kid killed. Impressions: Focused on the lady teacher this time, and she didn&amp;#39;t come out for the better. The monster of the week was one of these things, converted to just an insomnia demon, more or less. I guess they had realized they had probably overdone it on [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Out of ideas, huh? Impressions: The re-tour through the characters continues with a repeat of the pink one. Which was one of the better initial ones, but not the second go round. Instead of pretending like he&amp;#39;s dating her, he pretends like he&amp;#39;s dating one of them, but instead of a series of comedic [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 17:24:45 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Exciting end to a barely animated fight here. Impressions: After all that, they just&amp;#8230; kind of walk away. Oh, sure, one of them chases after them, and immediately gets sucker kicked and then insta-KOed, but then her buddy reappears and everyone goes home. Why? To make time for backstory, flashbacks, and setup. We&amp;#39;ve been [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:17:10 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; The training arc is stretching out to the entire season. Impressions: Starting to wonder if we&amp;#39;re even going to get a single monster encounter this season or if it&amp;#39;s going to be all training arcs and fanservice. The latter of which is expected, granted, but if we keep doing 15 seconds of checking in [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:45:40 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; At least the right part of the episode got the budget. Impressions: And here it was looking like the entire episode was going to be spent in meetings. With his extended harem. Still, it was entirely setup. We get the new mission, bodyguarding and bait, a quickie tour through a few extra members of [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; These children are idiots. Impressions: &amp;#8230;Fantastic, the fanservice snow girl again. For a beach episode, so extra fanservice on top. I don&amp;#39;t expect Shakespeare from this show, but it&amp;#39;s not comparing well lately even to the pure fanservice schlock of the slave licking and petting show. Bikinis for kids and feeding her iced coffee [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Oh no. The high school student isn&amp;#39;t a professional song writer. Impressions: It seems like we&amp;#39;re back into doing a march through each girl in turn, and a poor start of it here. An ex-fan of hers is mad at her because she&amp;#39;s not Trying Her Hardest&amp;#8482;. ie She has songwriter&amp;#39;s block. And so [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; CHOROIZE!! Impressions: Oh boy, a&amp;#160;literal training episode. As if we don&amp;#39;t have enough of that in anime. At least it appears to be only the one episode, as two completely random NPCs pop in and immediately succumb to giant tentacle disease or whatever. To be finished next week, but if we hadn&amp;#39;t spent a [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Ah, the advantages of very low expectations. Impressions: I&amp;#39;ll be honest, I had completely forgotten that her actual power was copying other powers since she uses the gun thing 99% of the time. Also, Tits McGee had a point that she hadn&amp;#39;t done jack squat to that point except rely on someone else, so [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
