      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; The training arc is stretching out to the entire season. Impressions: Starting to wonder if we&amp;#39;re even going to get a single monster encounter this season or if it&amp;#39;s going to be all training arcs and fanservice. The latter of which is expected, granted, but if we keep doing 15 seconds of checking in [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; At least the right part of the episode got the budget. Impressions: And here it was looking like the entire episode was going to be spent in meetings. With his extended harem. Still, it was entirely setup. We get the new mission, bodyguarding and bait, a quickie tour through a few extra members of [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; These children are idiots. Impressions: &amp;#8230;Fantastic, the fanservice snow girl again. For a beach episode, so extra fanservice on top. I don&amp;#39;t expect Shakespeare from this show, but it&amp;#39;s not comparing well lately even to the pure fanservice schlock of the slave licking and petting show. Bikinis for kids and feeding her iced coffee [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Oh no. The high school student isn&amp;#39;t a professional song writer. Impressions: It seems like we&amp;#39;re back into doing a march through each girl in turn, and a poor start of it here. An ex-fan of hers is mad at her because she&amp;#39;s not Trying Her Hardest&amp;#8482;. ie She has songwriter&amp;#39;s block. And so [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; CHOROIZE!! Impressions: Oh boy, a&amp;#160;literal training episode. As if we don&amp;#39;t have enough of that in anime. At least it appears to be only the one episode, as two completely random NPCs pop in and immediately succumb to giant tentacle disease or whatever. To be finished next week, but if we hadn&amp;#39;t spent a [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Ah, the advantages of very low expectations. Impressions: I&amp;#39;ll be honest, I had completely forgotten that her actual power was copying other powers since she uses the gun thing 99% of the time. Also, Tits McGee had a point that she hadn&amp;#39;t done jack squat to that point except rely on someone else, so [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; This was your grand plan? A hole? Impressions: A lot about this episode rubbed me the wrong way, and I think I&amp;#39;m going to pin that on the script, though certainly the moment in the sewers where it devolved into a series of stills didn&amp;#39;t help. The pieces for a solid episode were there [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Just the stupidest of animals. Impressions: Didn&amp;#39;t we already have an idiot justice freak monster? That wheel thing? That it even brought back for the pseudo-recap episode? Well, anyway, here&amp;#39;s a horse one, but even stupider than the previous, since it&amp;#39;s not pissed off about its shrine being desecrated, but&amp;#8230; trespassing on private property.

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Five different bakeries on one block, huh? If you&amp;#39;re curious about Samurai Troopers, the original guy is&amp;#160;just possessed, so everyone goes home and back to the hyperbolic VR time chamber to train some more. And I mean that literally. The baddies full on said &amp;#34;We&amp;#39;re leaving, but we&amp;#39;ll be back in a week, so [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&amp;#160; Why is your experimental panda monster being kept in a random locker? Impressions: Same issue as the last. The episodic format for each girl&amp;#160;is fine, but there was no substance to it, or anything that would have been different had she been substituted for any of the others&amp;#8230; or even not in the episode [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
