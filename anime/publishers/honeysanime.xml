        &lt;h3&gt;Comment from Taisei Iwasaki&lt;/h3&gt;
        “In middle school, I came across a magazine with an illustration of Motoko Kusanagi inside. That was the moment when I discovered Ghost in the Shell. Its unique touch and color set it apart from other works. Even the author’s name, Masamune Shirow, captivated me. I was stunned. I’ve since encountered the series in various forms. Now, I am truly honored to be a part of this project and its long history. The concept I envisioned for this project is “Sound Public Security Sector 9”. With the help of my talented friends, I will strive to make this long-awaited work even better. May we all come together soon.

        &lt;h3&gt;Comment from Ryo Konishi&lt;/h3&gt;
        “I first watched Innocence when I was in junior high school. Ever since my heart was stolen by its intense charm, I’ve pursued everything related to Ghost in the Shell. Its influence is deeply ingrained into my own work and philosophy. At first, I couldn’t believe that I was entrusted with creating music for this work, but I wanted to embrace this precious world. With that feeling in my heart, I took on this project with my entire body and soul. Follow the whispers of my ghost!”
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About Yuki Kanesaka&lt;/h2&gt;
        A music creator and composer based in Boston, creating music daily across the U.S. and Europe. In recent years, he’s been working as an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music, discovering music and developing technology, while also developing products for companies like 
        
        Sony and AlphaThetha/Pioneer. He enjoys working and can play around 74 instruments.
        Recent works:
        - Shiryu Sejima (artist)
        - Dr. Stone/Jujutsu Kaisen/Snowball Earth (anime music)
        - olkswagen/Kyupi/Meiji/Yonex (commercial music)
        - Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure/Sonic Racing (game music)
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Comment from Yuki Kanesaka&lt;/h3&gt;
        “I began with a single utterance: “Ghost in the Shell? Never heard of it!”, before immediately ordering every English and Japanese version I could get on Amazon. As I dove into composing at my private studio in Boston, a vast number of motifs began preparing for their musical journey. To Nashville, where my allies wait, for additional recordings. To a Shanghai hotel, for tailoring. Finally, the motifs’ journey comes to an end in Tokyo, transforming from a phenomenon called “a passage” into a message called “a suite”. A journey without hesitation, without blurring, without rewriting. These songs are like maps, etched with a trail of my thoughts and impulses.

        &lt;h2&gt;Grand Prize
        “Isekai’d with my dog, I&apos;m not the hero?!” by Frettiko&lt;/h2&gt;
        An average guy named Mitsuta is reincarnated into another world along with his pet dog, Toast. However, the goddess becomes utterly smitten with the adorable Toast and grants all of the hero’s bonuses to him instead. For a level 99 “Hero” Pomeranian, defeating monsters is a walk in the park. Meanwhile, his owner Mitsuta remains stuck at level 1...
        
        Constantly dragged along by the free-spirited Toast, Mitsuta gathers a group of quirky companions and runs an odd-jobs business, gradually carving out a place for himself in this new world. At this rate, they might even end up defeating the Demon King someday? A fluffy, feel-good comedy about a fun-filled isekai life with a beloved pet.

        Hiroyuki, an HR manager, is summoned to another world by a goddess. He has no combat ability whatsoever, but armed with the Divine Appraisal skill, which reveals hidden potential, he recruits allies and assembles the ultimate party.
        
        As Hiroyuki builds his team, however, the shadow of an assassin targeting him draws near... In a world far harsher than expected, can this hero’s party stand up to the Demon Lord’s army? A grand adventure begins as Hiroyuki uses his appraisal skills to save the world.

        Marcus and Gus are transported to another world while hungover. Desperate to impress an elf princess, they end up boasting that they will “defeat one of the Demon Lord’s generals.” By sheer chance, Marcus awakens to beer magic and starts blasting beer while shouting “Hop Missile!”, while Gus’s right arm, whose power he cannot consciously control, suddenly awakens... With zero ability and zero planning, but unmatched bravado, these two men launch into a wildly unpredictable isekai buddy comedy!

        &lt;h2&gt;Overall Review by KADOKAWA’s Editorial Department&lt;/h2&gt;
        KADOKAWA’s first English-language novel contest on Honeyfeed received 1,240 submissions, the highest number in the platform’s contest history. We are deeply honored by this response and delighted to see such strong interest from English-speaking creators in Japan’s light novel market.
        Following a rigorous selection process, one Grand Prize winner and two Contest Winners Prize recipients were selected. After initial voting by Honeyfeed users and volunteers, the final judging was conducted by Aneko Yusagi (author of The Rising of the Shield Hero) and editors from KADOKAWA.
        
        The Grand Prize winner, Isekai’d with My Dog, I’m Not the Hero?!, stood out for its catchy, approachable premise, making it easy to imagine on the shelves of Japanese bookstores. The novel delivers plenty of laugh-out-loud comedic moments, along with charming portrayals of Toast, the adorable dog. We were eager to read more about Toast’s exploits, his bond with the protagonist Mitsuta, and Mitsuta’s growth over the course of the story.
        The author, Frettiko, will receive a cash award of USD 5,000. The winning work will also be assigned a KADOKAWA editor and is scheduled for translation and publication in Japan, with a target release in 2027.
        
        The first Contest Winners Prize recipient, HR in Another World: Building the Strongest Parties with My Appraisal Skill, made effective use of the appraisal skill trope that has become a staple of the isekai genre, while capturing the distinctive feel of Japanese web novels. At the same time, its expansive setting evoked the scope of a large-scale open-world game. The careful portrayal of each character, along with story developments involving figures whose allegiance is unclear, added depth and originality to the narrative. 
        The author, Kaorin, will receive a cash award of USD 3,000. The work will also be assigned a KADOKAWA editor and revised with the aim of translation and publication in Japan.
        
        The second Contest Winners Prize recipient, Drinking Buddies: Hangover in Another World!, is a lighthearted comedy that keeps the pages turning. Its one-of-a-kind tone, blending concepts like “beer magic” with a chunibyo-style demonic arm, creates a brand of absurd humor that is strangely compelling. The two protagonists, Marcus and Gus, drinking buddies from our world, are character types rarely seen in Japanese fiction and are likely to feel fresh and distinctive to Japanese readers. 
        The author, Literate_Manul, will receive a cash award of USD 3,000. The work will also be assigned a KADOKAWA editor and revised with the aim of translation and publication in Japan.
        
        Going forward, KADOKAWA plans to continue hosting web novel contests in Japan and abroad to discover talented writers from around the world who share a passion for Japanese entertainment content.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from Aneko Yusagi (author of The Rising of the Shield Hero) on the Grand Prize-Winning Work&lt;/h2&gt;
        Isekai’d with My Dog, I’m Not the Hero?! feels like a novel written with a strong understanding of Japanese light novels. The characters are comical, the pacing is brisk, and the story offers a genuinely light, comedic reading experience. I read it with excitement, eager to see what would unfold in the misadventures of this delightfully mismatched party.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 – THE ISEKAI presented by KADOKAWA&lt;/h2&gt;
        Through this contest, KADOKAWA opened submissions worldwide for English-language isekai fantasy novels, looking for the next hit to follow in the footsteps of globally popular hits such as Overlord, Re:ZERO − Starting Life in Another World, The Rising of the Shield Hero, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation, and Sword Art Online.	
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About KADOKAWA’s Global UGC Content Development Project&lt;/h2&gt;
        In recent years, Japanese anime has surged in popularity worldwide, with many hit titles originating from light novels. In parallel, overseas online novel platforms have seen a growing number of works influenced by Japanese light novels, becoming fertile ground for creators with global potential. In response, KADOKAWA launched the Global UGC Content Development Project in 2025 as part of its Global Business Acceleration Program, which supports new overseas-oriented business initiatives. Through this project, KADOKAWA aims to discover global talent from international novel submission platforms and publish their works in Japan and abroad to create new hit IPs.
        
        The MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 – THE ISEKAI presented by KADOKAWA represents the first step in this effort. As another initiative under the same project, KADOKAWA also held the “Japan Debut Showdown☆Fantasy Light Novel Contest” in 2025 on KadoKado, a novel submission platform operated by Kadokawa Taiwan Corporation that accepts submissions in Traditional Chinese. The announcement of the winning works is scheduled for June 2026.
        
        In addition, plans are underway to publish Why Kill? When Witches Can Be Tentacled!, a work submitted to Honeyfeed, as well as selected winning titles from the JNC Original Light Novel Contest hosted by M12 Media LLC.

        &lt;a href=&quot;http://novelous.net&quot;&gt;NOVELOUS&lt;/a&gt; is an app for reading Japanese light novels. While many people are already familiar with the countless anime and manga series born in Japan, light novels, which often serve as their source material, remain lesser-known. This is partly due to the lack of widespread translations. Through NOVELOUS, Shogakukan, one of Japan’s leading publishers, will introduce North American readers to light novels that have yet to gain wide recognition, offering translations directly from the source.

        &lt;li&gt;Singer-songwriter majiko, who has garnered over 200 million streams across Asia and more than 580,000 YouTube subscribers, has been chosen to perform the opening theme for the TV anime The Food Diary of Miss Maid, which will begin airing in April. A new artist photo has also been released.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The new song is titled “Ribbon” and is scheduled for digital release in April to coincide with the anime’s broadcast. A preview of the track can be heard in the anime’s newly released promotional video.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;This will be majiko’s first anime tie-in since moving to Bandai Namco Music Live’s label UNIERA in July 2025. After releasing the EP GOLDEN JUNKIE last October and holding a solo concert in December, majiko continues to expand her activities in the music scene.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From majiko&lt;/h2&gt;
        I had the honor of writing a brand-new song titled “Ribbon” for the opening of The Food Diary of Miss Maid. When I read the story, I remember feeling my heart slowly warm, thinking, “What a gentle, heartwarming world this is...!” As I reflected on where I had felt this kind of warmth before, I realized it was in my interactions with all of you, my fans. 
        “Ribbon” is a song I wrote by blending Suzume-chan’s bright way of finding happiness in everyday life with the many heartfelt feelings I’ve received from my fans. 
        I would be happy if this song, along with the series, could softly tie itself into your daily lives as well.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Mrs. GREEN APPLE released their new song “lulu.” today. Originally announced as the first track of Phase 3, a new chapter in the band’s career that began on New Year’s Day, the song has now been revealed as the opening theme for season 2 of the anime Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, which begins airing on January 16.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;A music video for “lulu.” was also surprise-released on Mrs. GREEN APPLE’s official YouTube channel. Ahead of this release, a YouTube livestream began at 10:00 p.m. on January 11 after only the stream URL was posted on social media, without prior explanation. The livestream ran for approximately two hours before transitioning directly into the premiere of the “lulu.” music video, with peak concurrent viewership exceeding 200,000.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Unlike Phase 2, when music videos were typically announced in advance, the release of “lulu.” took place without prior notice, marking an unpredictable start to Phase 3 for Mrs. GREEN APPLE.

        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from Motoki Ohmori (Vo/Gt)&lt;/h2&gt;
        I’ve loved the series since the original manga, so it’s an honor to be involved.
        “lulu.” is a song about life, treasured things, memories, and will being passed from one person to another, flowing steadily into today and on to tomorrow. It also conveys the strength to move forward while carrying one’s hometown in one’s heart.
        As a fan of Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, I’m already very much looking forward to what this season will depict. I hope you’ll enjoy “lulu.” alongside the series.

        Mrs. GREEN APPLE was formed in 2013 and made their major debut in 2015 with the mini-album Variety. After releasing their best album 5 in July 2020, the band temporarily suspended activities before resuming in March 2022 following a hiatus of approximately one year and eight months. Their return was marked by the comeback concert “Utopia” and the release of the mini-album Unity on July 8. Later that year, they released “Soranji,” the theme song for the film Fragments of the Last Will.
        
        In 2023, their 10th anniversary year, Mrs. GREEN APPLE released the album ANTENNA, staged their largest arena tour to date along with their first dome shows, won the Japan Record Award with “Que Sera Sera,” and made their debut appearance on NHK’s Kohaku Uta Gassen with “Dance Hall.” In 2024, they released “Nachtmusik,” the theme song for the film Silent Love, followed by “Lilac,” the opening theme for the TV anime Oblivion Battery.
        
        Across major streaming platforms, 31 of the band’s songs have each surpassed 100 million plays. Among them, “Ao to Natsu” has exceeded 900 million plays, while multiple tracks including “Tenbyou no Uta (feat. Sonoko Inoue),” “Dance Hall,” and “Lilac” have surpassed 800 million. According to Billboard JAPAN and Oricon, Mrs. GREEN APPLE is the first artist in history to exceed 11 billion cumulative domestic streams across all songs.
        
        In 2025, marking the 10th anniversary of their debut, the band released their anniversary best album 10 on July 8, along with seven new songs, including the opening theme for the second cour of season 2 of the TV anime The Apothecary Diaries. They won three titles on the Oricon Yearly Rankings 2025 and seven titles on the Billboard JAPAN 2025 Year-End Charts. In addition, their anniversary best album 10 surpassed 1 million copies in cumulative sales, achieving million-seller status on the December 22 edition of the Oricon Daily Album Ranking.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Singer and voice actress Rico Sasaki has announced that she will release her full-length album RI PATHOS on June 3, 2026. Featuring ten all-new songs, the album reflects her journey to date and the future she is moving toward as an artist.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Each track is built around themes closely connected to Sasaki herself, with the album as a whole shaped by the choices she has made and the people she has encountered along the way, including detours and unexpected turns.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The limited first-press edition will include a bonus track, “Tezukuri no Uta,” the first song for which Sasaki wrote both the lyrics and music herself.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;In addition, tracks from the album will be released digitally over five consecutive months ahead of the full release. The first advance track, “Maru de Matryoshka,” is now available on streaming services.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from Rico Sasaki&lt;/h2&gt;
        The full album RI PATHOS represents the path I have walked so far. Even when things didn’t go smoothly, moments of uncertainty or stopping to move at my own pace were all important parts of that journey. I believe the time I spent taking those detours was necessary to connect with people I could never have met by moving straight ahead. Driven by passion, this album captures, in new songs, the moments when my soul was deeply moved. Through the five months of advance digital releases and the album’s release, I would be happy if you would continue walking this path together with me.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;REIRIE, a two-member unit formed in 2023 by Rei Kuromiya and Rie Kaneko, will make their major-label debut with the release of their first EP, Amethyst, on January 28, 2026, via MoooD Records, a label under Bandai Namco Music Live. Ahead of the release, the group has unveiled new artist photos, the EP’s jacket artwork, and the music video for “AISHITEYO,” one of the tracks featured on Amethyst.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The new visuals feature a black-and-white palette set against the theme color of amethyst. Styling that layers contrasting materials such as lace, fur, and leather reflects REIRIE’s balance of stillness and movement. Their delicate yet sharp demeanor leaves a strong impression as the start of a new chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Amethyst will be released in three editions: the REI Edition, the RIE Edition, and the Standard Edition. The REI Edition includes a Blu-ray featuring footage from the free live show “JAM,” held on September 12 at Kabukicho Tower Stage, while the RIE Edition comes with a Blu-ray of the Tokyo performance from REIRIE Live Tour 2025 -BaD＝DoLL-, held on October 26. As a first-press bonus, all editions will include one randomly selected trading card from a set of six.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The EP comprises five tracks rooted in guitar rock, incorporating emotional, alternative, and R&amp;B elements that highlight the duo’s expressive range and vocal contrast. The advance digital single “BaD＝DoLL,” composed by Yuki Tsujimura and MEGMETAL, delivers an emotionally charged rock sound. “AISHITEYO,” by the same creative team, channels raw emotion and heightened drama, further brought to life in the music video released today.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The EP also features “Holy Brighters,” which portrays heroism that moves forward despite doubt and anxiety, “Not Philosophy,” which explores strength and love through emotion rather than words, and “Contact,” a soulful R&amp;B-based track that affirms even pain and inner conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;In addition, REIRIE will launch their nationwide tour, “REIRIE Live Tour 2026 -Amethyst-,” in February 2026. Spanning 12 cities, the tour will be the largest of the group’s career to date.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Maaya Sakamoto just released her newest digital single “Tokei”, which has also been chosen as the theme song for the final chapter of popular mobile RPG Fate/Grand Order. The multi-talented singer, voice actress, actress, songwriter and essayist released her 30th anniversary album M30~Your Best~ in October 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“Tokei” is the sixth track in the Fate/Grand Order series, following “Shikisai”, “Gyakko”, “Kuuhaku”, “Yakudo” and “Dokuhaku”. Maaya Sakamoto wrote the lyrics herself and composed the theme song for the conclusion of the series she has been a part of for ten years.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The theme song is an emotional track depicting “hope for the future”, setting it apart from previous theme songs from the FGO series. Ryo Eguchi arranged the song, a member of la la larks who helped compose and arrange “Shikisai” and the arrangement for “Gyakko”.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The result is a richly-layered track that is fitting for the final chapter of the FGO series, created by a team who know the series by heart.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The music video for “Tokei” premiered December 29 and features an animated style, numerous characters from the Fate/Grand Order series, and visuals that complement the grand finale of the work and its theme song.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;New information regarding the release of upcoming singles “Kirei.” and “Wakaba no Koro,” the opening and ending theme songs for TV anime Kirei ni Shitemoraemasu ka, have been released. Kirei ni Shitemoraemasu ka, also known as “Wash It All Away” in English adaptations, will begin airing January 5, 2026. The original work by popular manga artist Mitsuru Hattori is a heartwarming series that follows a cleaning service based in Atami, Japan.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The opening theme song “Kirei.” is performed by up-and-coming singer Yuu., known for her powerful vocal abilities and expressive voice, who has become popular among teens and twenty-somethings with over 370,000 subscribers on YouTube. The song was written and composed by Vocaloid producer Jin, renowned for songs such as “Yobanashi Deceive” and “Summertime Record” and for providing music for numerous forms of content.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Yuu.’s first CD release has also been announced. First edition copies and standard edition copies will be available. The first edition copies will come with a bonus Blu-ray disc. More details will be released at a later date.

        &lt;li&gt;The ending theme song “Wakaba no Koro” is written and performed by songwriter and actress Natsumi Kiyoura. The heartfelt pop song was written through the eyes of the anime’s main character Wakana Kinme. Both the theme song and the additional bonus tracks were produced by Katsutoshi Kitagawa from Round Table, who has supported Kiyoura’s live performances throughout the years.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Kiyoura’s latest artist photo has also been released! The photo and CD jacket were photographed in Atami, where the upcoming anime takes place. CD jacket details will be released at a later date.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Comments From Yuu. (Singer for OP Theme Song “Kirei.”)&lt;/h2&gt;
        I’m Yuu., nice to meet you!It’s an honor to perform the opening theme song. I’m very happy to be singing my very first anime theme song at 20 years old! I sang while imagining the beautiful sea of Atami and cherishing the human connections and feelings of warmth that are evident throughout this story. I hope you enjoy this anime while appreciating the heartwarming scenes and feelings it evokes.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Jin (Writer and Composer for OP Theme Song “Kirei.”)&lt;/h2&gt;
        Things that are clean, transparent, and tidy. Things that change shape over time. Things that are layered with stains and scratches that give them character. “Kirei” comes to mind. Such a word that is soaked in human emotion is the theme of this song.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Natsumi Kiyoura (Singer and Lyrics for ED Theme Song “Wakaba no Koro”)&lt;/h2&gt;
        My first impression of the original manga left me pondering Ms. Kinme’s dedication to her work and her kindness, as well as the dappling sunlight through the trees and seasons we see during our everyday life. “Wakaba no Koro” captures the feelings of early summer, fleeting moments of youth, and singular pages in the story of life. You can trust the ending theme song for this anime in my hands.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Katsutoshi Kitagawa (Producer for ED Theme Song “Wakaba no Koro”)&lt;/h2&gt;
        Having lived in Hakodate until high school, imagining life in a coastal town brought back memories. Like biking to the shore and spending the afternoon with a paperback book. I thought I’d like to make a song that is filled with the essence of the original work and my memories like the smell of a seaside town. I hope you can feel the softness of the acoustic guitar and string instruments and the warmth of the woodwinds.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Frontier Works and Yamaha Music Communications will debut a new virtual artist, SHINO, as part of a project that fuses singing, dancing, and CG on December 17, 2025. At 0:00 on the same day, SHINO will release the digital single “EGO,” an aggressive, hardcore EDM track.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;SHINO carries both male and female souls within a single body, switching between them depending on the song or performance. Through two forms—SHINO-BEAT (male persona) and SHINO-LOOP (female persona)—their voice, speech, movements, and dance style change, offering a new form of expression alongside rhythm-driven global music such as EDM, soul, and funk.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Following the digital release, SHINO will deliver music videos, 3D live performances combining CG and dance, and social media content, offering a cross-reality experience. Fans are invited to immerse themselves in this innovative “persona-switching live experience.”
        SHINO’s second single, “SUSHI BOYS HERO,” is already scheduled for release on January 7, 2026.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The third trailer for upcoming new anime Easygoing Territory Defense by the Optimistic Lord, airing January of next year, has been revealed along with the ending theme song which will be sung by Nonoka Obuchi. “Make it” will be her third single and is scheduled to be released February 25, 2026. A new artist photo and CD jacket photo has also been revealed.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The popular “isekai” fantasy series Easygoing Territory Defense by the Optimistic Lord: Production Magic Turns a Nameless Village into the Strongest Fortified City has gained a following for its thrilling exploits and the unyielding personalities of its characters, with over 2.5 million physical and digital copies sold.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The latest update on the upcoming anime revealed the third trailer, the second teaser visual, new characters and the ending theme song. The new character Lada Priora will be voiced by voice actress and singer, Nonoka Obuchi, who also sings the ending theme song for the anime “Make it.” Nonoka Obuchi’s third single “Make it” is scheduled to be released February 25, 2026.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The new single will be released in three editions: the standard edition, anime edition, and a limited edition that comes with one of ten randomly chosen autographed polaroids and a photobook that came with her first and second singles. “Make it,” produced by emon(Tes.), is a gentle track with an upbeat sound that invites listeners to unwind. Check out a snippet of the new single in the latest teaser for the anime. The limited edition single will also come with a recording of Fuwari’s “SweetRoom823,” the theme song for Obuchi’s upcoming drama Fukukaicho no Omona Oshigoto, scheduled for January 2026. Standard and anime editions of the single will feature more songs written and produced by artists such as Karasuyasabo, Yasuhiro, and furu_ri.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The jacket cover for the standard and limited edition singles is florally-inspired, featuring Nonoka Obuchi with a stunning bouquet of flowers. The anime edition will feature a special illustration that will be released at a later date.&lt;/li&gt;	
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Nonoka Obuchi’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        When I first read the original series, I was moved by the warmth of Van and his crew, despite coming from various walks of life. If you worry about what you were born with or where you are currently, give this song a listen, take yourself by the hand and take it easy.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;emon(Tes.)’s comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        This song is my attempt at giving sound to the feelings of the characters and the atmosphere of the original work. Music builds on the emotions that are brought forth from a story, so I’d be happy if this song sits quietly in the heart of everyone who listens to it.

We had the chance to talk with her once again, this time about her new EP, the journey so far, and the mindset behind the artist fans have come to love.

        Hello, Nowlu. Welcome back to Honey&apos;s Anime! So, for those who don&apos;t know you, your artist name “Nowlu” is described as combining the words “Night,&quot; &quot;Owl.&quot; and &quot;Luna”. Could you tell us how you came up with this name, and which aspects of those words resonate with your music?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Thank you! Nowlu comes from the image of a lone owl spreading its wings toward the moon (or the world) at night. My team and I explored words inspired by my voice and discussed them until we arrived at this name. It’s difficult to compare the words individually, but I feel the “Night” aspect shines through most strongly in the worlds my voice creates.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        That’s so cool and poetic! Your music often blends R&amp;B, neo‐city‐pop, 80s/90s inspired beats, and a smoky voice. How do you balance these stylistic elements with your own personal sound?
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        Can you tell us about your most recent release, the ending theme of the TV anime &quot;Mugen Gacha&quot; (Backstabbed in a Backwater Dungeon)? What kind of feeling or message did you want listeners to carry with them after hearing ‘Shirogarasu’?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        “Shirogarasu” means “white crow.” In this song, the crow symbolizes revenge and white symbolizes justice.
        
        A white crow is a metaphor for something impossible, which ties into the story, and it also reflects the protagonist Light, who carries both light and shadow within him. That overlap made the title feel like a perfect fit.
        
        Flight usually carries a positive image of moving forward with determination, but I approached it from a different angle. The lyrics contain traces of irony toward those driven by revenge, as if saying “I’m above you.”
        
        The words evoke a “quietly burning inner blue flame,” and the sharp, spicy piano lines give it a tingling edge, creating a sophisticated, cool house track. I hope listeners enjoy that interplay.
        
        Even if the story’s exhilarating moments leave you drained, I think this song will help you remember your purpose again and serve as the fuel that carries you to the next episode.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Your new EP &apos;Dose&apos; was released on September 1, 2025 and features six previously released songs and the brand-new title track of the same name. In choosing to build the EP around your earlier works together with this new song, what was your intention behind the title Dose? How do you see the title track reflecting your growth or change as an artist, especially compared with the previous songs included? 
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        The new song “Dose” opens the EP, and from there, the previously released tracks trace my journey. It’s like a profile of the path I’ve walked so far.
        
        “Dose” is about a truly painful night in my life. I felt the fear and loneliness of being unnecessary, and the vague anxiety of wondering how long it would last, until it built up to the point where I could barely breathe. It was terrifying and agonizing.
        
        Humans tend to beautify memories, so eventually even this will fade and be forgotten. At the time, I wanted to forget it because it was so painful, but I also remembered the desperate notes I had scribbled during those days.
        
        “Dose” was actually the working title. It’s a word of resignation in Japanese, but it was this word that somehow pulled me out of that unbearable suffering. I decided to turn it into a song because I felt that the memory of that night, and the emotional outburst it carried, might offer comfort to someone else. 
        Even though it’s a song born from despair, I also wanted people to feel the melody and move to it. So I focused on singing in a more danceable, groovy way than usual. I hope that comes through.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Your song “Stuck on you,” one of our favorites, achieved major streaming success overseas, especially in North America. How does it feel to have an international audience, and how do you keep in mind the global listeners when creating music?

        This year, I performed live overseas for the first time, in Brazil and Malaysia, and had the chance to meet listeners face-to-face. That’s when I truly felt, “Ah, I really am Nowlu.” (laughs)
        
        At the same time, I was genuinely amazed that, even in countries with different languages, there are listeners singing along with Japanese lyrics. It’s such a wonderful and heartwarming experience, and it reminded me once again of just how incredible Japanese anime is.
        
        Because I have so many global listeners, I’m particularly careful with my lyrics and ways of expressing myself, aiming to let people feel the beauty and depth of the Japanese language.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Of course, all of my songs and works are meaningful, but if I had to choose, I’d say “Yoin” and “Dose.”
        
        “Yoin” is a song about a fresh start and was also the ending theme for my first TV drama (Wingman), so it’s deeply memorable and holds a special place in my heart, fulfilling a dream I’ve had since childhood.
        
        “Dose” isn’t just cool musically, it’s very much a reflection of my heart. I hope to make it a song that many people can love deeply and for a long time.

        I want to be surrounded by the voices of tens of thousands of people singing my songs. Absolutely.
        
        I also want to keep expressing, through my words and poetry, what I believe is right, along with a touch of irony, without compromise.
        
        A major goal of mine is to stand on the stage of Madison Square Garden, where the person I admired and who inspired me to start singing once stood, and take in the same view they saw.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Daoko has released a music video for “Rhythm in the Sunset,” the lead track from her latest digital EP meta millefeuille, which came out on November 19, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The popular “isekai” fantasy series Easygoing Territory Defense by the Optimistic Lord: Production Magic Turns a Nameless Village into the Strongest Fortified City has gained a following for its thrilling exploits and the unyielding personalities of its characters, with over 2.5 million physical and digital copies sold.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The video was directed by Yuichiro Saeki, who previously handled Daoko’s music videos “Otogi no Machi” and “Kaeritai!” and is currently joining her Asia tour as a VJ. The piece blends nostalgic footage from Daoko’s everyday life with modern graphics, creating a warm, 2000s-inspired work that evokes brief flashes of memory.&lt;/li&gt;	
        
        https://youtu.be/oTyn9eP8oGE
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Daoko’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        I put this song together by arranging my favorite words found in everyday life to match namitape’s exciting sound. While creating it, I pictured scenes from a walk, and with that image in mind, I wanted the music video to feel familiar and approachable, so I asked Director Saeki, with whom I have a close relationship and whom I deeply respect. The shoot was very enjoyable, with a calm, pleasant atmosphere throughout. The gentle expressions we captured during that warm, sunlit moment are closer to my natural self than what I’ve shown before, which makes me feel a little shy, but Director Saeki brought everything together beautifully, so I hope you enjoy it.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Yuichiro Saeki&apos;s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        I hope you can enjoy Daoko’s expressions and gestures, which shine with a unique radiance while remaining true to herself, together with the world of the song.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;On November 9, the four-member female vocal and dance group PassCode held their arena concert PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX” at Yokohama BUNTAI in Kanagawa. Marking their first arena performance in about three years and nine months since their 2022 Budokan show, the event was a special occasion for both the group and their fans. On this day, they surprised the audience with the first-ever live performance of their latest song “Liberator,” announced as the opening theme for the TV anime Roll Over and Die, set to begin airing in January 2026. They also revealed that the song will be released as a single on March 4, 2026.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Published by Micro Magazine, Roll Over and Die is a dark fantasy story about the protagonist, Flum, who, despite having zero stats, is chosen by the God Origin to join the Hero’s Party and continues to push forward alongside newfound companions. PassCode’s opening theme “Liberator” can be heard in the anime’s newly released PV.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Alongside the single announcement, PassCode unveiled a new artist photo featuring the denim-based outfits worn at Yokohama BUNTAI. The fresh visual marks a shift from their previous images, showcasing a brighter, more pop-inspired style.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;It was also announced that the Yokohama BUNTAI concert will be exclusively streamed on U-NEXT, with the streaming start date to be revealed later via PassCode’s official social media. Leading up to that release, several past performances will be available for unlimited streaming: PassCode ASIA TOUR 2024 Final at Zepp Osaka Bayside on November 13, PassCode presents VERSUS PASSCODE 2024 Vol.2 at Spotify O-EAST on November 27, and PassCode Zephyren 10th Anniversary A.V.E.S.T project Kodo at Yoyogi National Stadium First Gymnasium on December 18. Whether you couldn’t make it to the arena or joined the excitement in person, you can relive the energy through these past live performances before the Yokohama BUNTAI stream goes live.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;About PassCode&lt;/h2&gt;
        PassCode consists of four members: Nao Minami, Kaede Takashima, Hinako Ogami, and Emily Arima. They have a versatile repertoire based on a band sound, punctuated by their distinctive shouts and screams, and have performed at numerous major festivals such as SUMMER SONIC and ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL, earning broad support from both rock enthusiasts and idol fans.
        
        After making their major debut in 2016, they released their first international album Ex Libris PassCode in America, Europe, and Canada under the UK’s JPU Records in October 2018. The track “Ichikabachika” from their 2019 album CLARITY was selected as the opening theme for the TV drama Kakegurui season 2 and the movie Kakegurui. In 2020, their single “STARRY SKY,” which was chosen as the theme song for the drama 182 Days Left, earned them their first-ever No. 1 on the Oricon Weekly Single Chart and Billboard JAPAN Weekly Single Chart. They also made their debut appearance on Nippon Broadcasting System’s All Night Nippon 0.
        
        In February 2022, they held their first concert at Nippon Budokan. In 2023, they embarked on their first US tour, “PassCode US / JAPAN TOUR 2023 -GROUNDSWELL-,” which included stops in Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, as well as 11 cities and 12 venues in Japan. In June 2024, they moved to Bandai Namco Music Live. Their September release “WILLSHINE” was chosen as the OP theme for season 2 of the anime SHY, and their new song “SKILLAWAKE” was selected as the OP theme for season 2 of As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I’ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World. Looking ahead, their first arena concert in about three years, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX”, is scheduled for November 2025.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;AVIOT, operated by Preseed Japan Corporation, which manufactures and sells consumer electronics, has released its The Prince of Tennis II collaboration true wireless earbuds in North America. The earbuds are available in two models themed after the series’ iconic schools: TE-V1R-TP1, inspired by Seishun Academy (Seigaku), and TE-V1R-TP2, inspired by Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School (Rikkai).&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Based on the TE-V1R, the TE-V1R-TP1 and TE-V1R-TP2 are special edition wireless earbuds designed to fully capture the charm of The Prince of Tennis II.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The Seigaku model includes voices from nine characters: Ryoma Echizen, Kunimitsu Tezuka, Shuichiro Oishi, Shusuke Fuji, Sadaharu Inui, Eiji Kikumaru, Takashi Kawamura, Takeshi Momoshiro, and Kaoru Kaido. The Rikkai model includes eight characters: Seiichi Yukimura, Genichiro Sanada, Renji Yanagi, Masaharu Niou, Hiroshi Yagyu, Bunta Marui, Jackal Kuwahara, and Akaya Kirihara.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Together, the two models contain 350 newly recorded voice lines, from operational voice guidance for notifications like power and connection status to a “random voice” function that plays memorable quotes from the series. Users can switch between 17 modes through the dedicated app.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;From the earbuds and charging case to the packaging, every detail has been carefully crafted for a premium, fan-focused experience, with audio tuned by series composer UZA for optimal music playback. In the promotional video, Ryoma Echizen and Kunimitsu Tezuka themselves introduce the products. Please check it out!

        The TE-V1R is the latest model in AVIOT’s popular V series, which has sold approximately 190,000 units*. The earbuds offer an ultra-long battery life of 19 hours (62 hours with the charging case) and Adaptive Hybrid Noise Canceling, which automatically adjusts the noise reduction strength based on the surrounding environment. They also feature the new Hybrid Dual Driver 2.0 for enhanced sound quality, LDAC™ support for high-resolution playback, and wireless charging functionality, making them a high-grade model that perfectly balances sound quality and functionality.
        
        *As of the end of April 2025
        
        &lt;b&gt;Special Voice Lines&lt;/b&gt;
        The earbuds feature over 350 newly recorded lines across two models, including voice guidance for notifications such as power and connection status, as well as a “random voice” function with memorable quotes from the series.

        &lt;b&gt;Special Design&lt;/b&gt;
        The charging cases feature color schemes inspired by Seigaku and Rikkai, with a glossy finish for a premium feel. The sides of the cases and the metal parts of the earbuds are adorned with original logos based on the series title, creating a design that captures the anime’s world while blending naturally into everyday use.

        &lt;b&gt;Special Tuning&lt;/b&gt;
        The sound was tuned by UZA, who composed the soundtrack for The Prince of Tennis II, creating a unique audio experience that lets you feel the excitement of the Prince of Tennis Festival wherever you are.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Comment from Composer UZA&lt;/b&gt;
        “With this tuning, my goal was to recreate the atmosphere of the Prince of Tennis Festival.
        
        I drew on songs from across the series’ 20-plus-year history as reference material, but with such a long history, the volume levels and sound quality varied widely, which made finding the right balance a real challenge. When in doubt, I went back to my roots: I listened to the first season’s opening, “future,” and adjusted the sound so the lows and mids would carry more weight, while the highs would highlight the richness and vibrancy of the artists’ and voice actors’ voices.
        
        I hope you’ll feel the same excitement as if you were actually at a Prince of Tennis Festival. Whether recording, mixing, or mastering, I always strive for the best balance and sound quality, and through this collaboration with AVIOT, I was reminded that sound can always keep evolving. Thank you!”

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Up and coming singer Rei Nakashima, winner of the InuCon! 2022 grand prix, will be releasing her highly anticipated third single “Okirakuze~shon” February 18, 2026! The song was produced by Hyadain (Kenichi Maeyamada) and chosen as the opening theme song for TV anime Easygoing Territory Defense by the Optimistic Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Written by renowned hit-maker Kenichi Maeyamada, “Okirakuze~shon” is a lively track that deviates from Rei Nakashima’s previous image. Rei Nakashima’s laid-back style and the fun-filled atmosphere of the track result in a relaxed and easygoing pop song. Its upbeat, cheery melody and Nakashima’s silky smooth vocals pair perfectly with the feel of the anime and will invite listeners to sit back and take a load off. A portion of the track was sampled in the latest promotional video for Easygoing Territory Defense by the Optimistic Lord that was released on October 19.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        
        &lt;li&gt;Rei Nakashima’s “Moshimo,” the theme song for her weekly Sunday night radio show “Kyou mo Hanamaru!” will be recorded on both the first editions and standard editions of the single as the coupling track. “Moshimo” was produced by Nakashima herself and remains her most popular track among fans. The first edition of the single will also include “Otona Atsukai,” an exclusive track that’s never been recorded on CD. It was written by Nakashima when she was in high school and produced in commemoration of her 20th birthday last year for online streaming. More track information will be released at a later date.
        &lt;/li&gt;

I’ve been a fan of Calliope’s for some time and have listened to many of her songs, but from the first time I heard ‘LET’S JUST CRASH,’ its explosive energy hit me like a powerful drug. I’m extremely grateful to have been part of the production. I put a lot of thought into how to visually express the captivating sounds and vocals scattered throughout the track. I hope you enjoy it.”&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The CG production was handled by Kanaban Graphics, known for Usavich. This marks Mori Calliope’s first fully 3D animated music video.

        &lt;h2&gt;Mekakushe’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        When we are born, and when we die, we are all alone.
        Even when you’re beside me, I am still alone.
        That loneliness feels unbearable sometimes.
        Unless you—Loneliness itself—knock on the door of dawn, my night will never end.
        But lately, I’ve begun to think maybe that’s alright.
        It’s okay to be lonely.
        Because I’m lonely, I want to be with you.
        Because I’m lonely, I sing.
        And I want to feel joy in that.
        May my album Love After 13.8 Billion Years never stop playing.
        May I keep wandering through your universe, even in the next life.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Kyabeshi’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        Just like you see different scenes when you flip a snow globe, we’ve packed a variety of scenes into this music video. I’d love to hear how this video, this world, looks to you.
        
        P.S. I secretly hid seven shrimp, Mekakushe’s favorite, somewhere in the video. See if you can find them!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Meyoco’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        It’s an honor to create an artwork for mekakushe-san’s music. I had a lot of fun creating the illustration from beginning to end. I was given the chance to create the artwork according to my style, which I deeply appreciate. The main theme I wanted to cover is a combination of “time” and “space,” with the motif of the clock being a dominant element in the artwork alongside the girl. I wanted the artworks to look warm and peaceful, the way you would feel when remembering someone you love. I hope my illustrations could serve well as a companion to mekakushe-san’s music.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from Kousuke Hayashi (Scenarioart)&lt;/h2&gt;
        I arranged the song to evoke a sense of nostalgia in anyone’s heart. While working on it, I found comfort in how the music seemed to gently loosen the heart, like returning to a shared hometown.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from Otsukimi&lt;/h2&gt;
        I’m truly honored to have been asked to create the music video for “Space Gate.”
        I had a wonderful time illustrating a world inspired by the moon, the stars, and the cosmos. The rotating merry-go-round scene is especially dear to me. It came together through many rounds of brainstorming and careful fine-tuning. The reversal of its rotation between the first and second halves expresses the emotional shift of the girl in the story. I hope you enjoy this touch along with the beautiful song and lyrics.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Kousuke Hayashi’s Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
        Vocalist and guitarist for the rock band Scenarioart, Kosuke also works as a lyricist, composer, and arranger.

        &lt;h2&gt;Mekakushe’s Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
        Handling lyrics, composition, vocals, and piano performance by herself, the next-generation singer-songwriter Mekakushe enjoys immense popularity among artists and creators. Starting classical piano at the age of three, she gradually gravitated towards pop music. Her independently produced songs were featured in a Kao Laurier commercial, and she was one of the top artists on the Spotify official playlist “Kirakira Pop Japan” with a total of 3 million plays. She is a promising emerging artist with anticipated future success.

        We love the Ultraman Omega opening and ending themes. How would you describe the connection of “BRIGHT EYES,” and which elements of the series influenced the music and lyrics of the song?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        It’s truly an honor. From NARASAKI, who composed the music, and Matsui, who wrote the lyrics, I received a song of great importance. The moment I first heard the demo, I thought, “This is Ultraman.”
        
        I’ve been a huge fan of the Ultraman series since childhood, right up to now. For all six years of elementary school, I used to write letters to Ultraman. I would even get replies, and reading those letters was part of my childhood.
        
        That’s why, with all my love for Ultraman, I put my heart into singing every single note, hoping to give courage to the children who will grow up watching Omega. Who knows, maybe among those kids, there will be someone who dreams of becoming a musician and one day sings a theme song like I did. I want to keep passing the baton into the future.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        You incorporated rap and lyrics into &quot;Missing Link,&quot; the ending theme with MindaRyn. Do you prefer rapping or singing, and which do you find more challenging to perform live?
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        Both are part of my expression and my roots. I don’t find either one more challenging than the other. I always strive to give my best and make sure I’m fully prepared.

        Now, ASH DA HERO is currently on a world tour. What has this experience been like so far? Do you have a road story you&apos;d like to share with your fans?

        It’s been full of interesting experiences. One tour story that stands out is from San Antonio, Texas. When I sang Deep in the Heart of Texas, the audience sang along and clapped with me, which was both wonderful and hilarious! Everyone in San Antonio was laughing, kind of like, “Why?” I really love surprises like that.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;World-wide hit series The Ancient Magus’ Bride has over 12 million copies of the manga sold, two anime adaptations and numerous multi-media projects to date. The new best album featuring theme songs and insert songs from the popular series will be going on sale November 26, 2025! The CD cover for both the first edition and standard edition albums will feature special illustrations by the author Koré Yamazaki.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The first disc will include all of the main theme songs from both seasons such as “Here”, “Cycle”, “Nemurasareta Lineage” and more! The second disc will include popular insert songs from the anime such as “Iruna Eteluro” and “Dance of the Spirit.” Tracks such as “Quiet Choir” and “Holiday” which will be recorded on CD for the very first time on this album. The main theme song from the recently released game The Ancient Magus’ Bride: Seika no Maboroshi to Yume Miru Tabiji “Sagashimono” will be featured as well.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;First editions will include a third disc featuring a collection of 15 tracks from the anime score selected by pianist Junichi Matsumoto, making the album a complete collection of music from the world of The Ancient Magus’ Bride.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Ahead of the album’s release, voices of Chise (Atsumi Tanezaki) and Elias (Ryouta Takeuchi), JUNNA and Junichi Matsumoto gave a special comment.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Atsumi Tanezaki (Chise V.A.)&lt;/h2&gt;
        Congratulations on the release of the new album The Ancient Magus’ Bride Complete Best! Every song plays a crucial role in the world of The Ancient Magus’ Bride. JUNNA’s “Here” pulls on my heartstrings as it takes me back to where it all began. I still remember humming “Hana Kazoe” like a lullaby during a recording session, trying to sing like Chise. I hope everyone immerses themselves once more into this magical world through this album. I know I will be. I can’t wait for its release...!
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Ryouta Takeuchi (Elias V.A.)&lt;/h2&gt;
        The soundtrack and music of The Ancient Magus’ Bride is so memorable, but the scene that stands out to me the most is from season 1 episode 12 when Chise finishes making her wand and returns to Elias using magic! For a scene with zero dialogue, it makes for a truly touching and beautiful scene, consisting of only the opening theme “Here” and the visuals! The music of this anime has a mysterious way of making emotions visible. I want everyone to revisit this story through this album!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From JUNNA&lt;/h2&gt;
        Congratulations on the new album. My first single as a singer was “Here,” so The Ancient Magus’ Bride truly is a work that allowed me to grow alongside it and encounter new things. As a fan of a series that’s loved by many, and as an artist, I’m looking forward to enjoying what’s to come.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Junichi Matsumoto&lt;/h2&gt;
        Congratulations on the new album. It all came back to me...the scenes, the colors, the atmosphere, the air, the eyes, the expressions, the voices and the sounds... I’m happy to experience them all again through the music. I’ve carefully selected 15 tracks. I hope you enjoy this brief journey through the sounds of The Ancient Magus’ Bride.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Singer-songwriter mekakushe has released a new song, “Snow Globe Galaxy.” This track is a pre-release from the digital album 138 Oku-nen Me no Koi, scheduled for release on November 7, 2025. Written and composed by mekakushe and arranged by Sondai Nishijima, the song is a two-step track that condenses three minutes of technical beats, as if the universe itself were trapped inside a snow globe. The jacket art and music video were created by collage artist kyabeshi.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The jacket art for 138 Oku-nen Me no Koi has also been revealed. It was created by Southeast Asia–based illustrator Meyoco, an Instagram influencer with over 1.17 million followers who also runs her own apparel line. In addition to the main artwork, she drew complementary illustrations, which will appear on acrylic panels distributed as special gifts for the 1st and 2nd stages of mekakushe Planetarium Acoustic Live ~138 Oku-nen Me no Koi~ on November 27.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Mekakushe’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        Snow globes are beautiful and lonely, holding beginnings and endings, a fleeting eternity trapped inside. When I was little, I loved gazing at them. An infinite world fit in the palm of my hand, self-contained, compressed into a single space, and it made my heart race. Music feels the same. It ends eventually, but for a moment, it becomes my own small, enclosed world of beauty. This song is like a snow globe you can listen to, three minutes capturing beginnings and endings, beauty and loneliness, all in one.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Sondai Nishijima’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        “Snow Globe Galaxy” is the wild card of the album, packed with surprises in its short runtime. Its signature lies in rollercoaster-like twists and technical beats. I asked Mekakushe to tackle many challenging harmonies and choruses (sorry!), and she sang beautifully, bringing to life a one-of-a-kind snow globe. Enjoy!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Kyabeshi’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        Just like you see different scenes when you flip a snow globe, we’ve packed a variety of scenes into this music video. I’d love to hear how this video, this world, looks to you.
        
        P.S. I secretly hid seven shrimp, Mekakushe’s favorite, somewhere in the video. See if you can find them!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Meyoco’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        It’s an honor to create an artwork for mekakushe-san’s music. I had a lot of fun creating the illustration from beginning to end. I was given the chance to create the artwork according to my style, which I deeply appreciate. The main theme I wanted to cover is a combination of “time” and “space,” with the motif of the clock being a dominant element in the artwork alongside the girl. I wanted the artworks to look warm and peaceful, the way you would feel when remembering someone you love. I hope my illustrations could serve well as a companion to mekakushe-san’s music.

        &lt;li&gt;The tour title, combining “YOU” and “ZIZAI” (“freely”), builds on the theme of Slash-&amp;-Burn: clearing away the old to make room for new growth. It reflects Daoko’s wish to share new musical expressions with listeners, as she continues exploring fresh creative territory with fans across Asia.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;AVIOT, operated by Preseed Japan Corporation, which manufactures and sells consumer electronics, has opened pre-orders for the TE-V1R-ULZ true wireless earbuds, created in collaboration with Ultraman Z. Based on the TE-V1R, this special edition features over 350 newly recorded voice lines by four members of the anti-kaiju robot force   STORAGE and four Ultraman, original earbud design and packaging, and sound tuning by Masaaki Endoh.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;From the packaging and design to the voice guidance and sound tuning, the TE-V1R-ULZ has been fully customized in tribute to Ultraman Z.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The earbuds and charging case feature a color scheme inspired by the STORAGE unit insignia, blending a military aesthetic with the heroic spirit of the Ultraman universe.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;In addition to voice guidance for notifications like power and connection status, these earbuds feature a “random voice” function packed with memorable lines from the show. Altogether, 350 newly recorded voice lines are included across 14 modes, including 6 duo modes with interactions between the four STORAGE members (Haruki Natsukawa, Shota Hebikura, Yoko Nakashima, and Yuka Ohta) and the four Ultraman (Ultraman Z, Ultraman Zero, Ultraman Geed, and Ultraman Belial).&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The special STORAGE-themed packaging includes two exclusive oversleeves showcasing all four featured Ultraman.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The sound tuning was supervised by Masaaki Endoh, vocalist of the opening theme “I ask that you chant my name!”&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Product Characteristics&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Base Model&lt;/b&gt;
        The TE-V1R is the latest model in AVIOT’s popular V series, which has sold approximately 190,000 units*. The earbuds offer an ultra-long battery life of 19 hours (62 hours with the charging case) and Adaptive Hybrid Noise Canceling, which automatically adjusts the noise reduction strength based on the surrounding environment. They also feature the new Hybrid Dual Driver 2.0 for enhanced sound quality, LDAC™ support for high-resolution playback, and wireless charging functionality, making them a high-grade model that perfectly balances sound quality and functionality.
        
        *As of the end of April 2025
        
        &lt;b&gt;Special Voice Lines&lt;/b&gt;
        In addition to voice guidance for notifications like power and connection status, these earbuds feature a “random voice” function packed with memorable lines from the show. With four members of STORAGE (Haruki Natsukawa, Shota Hebikura, Yoko Nakashima, and Yuka Ohta) and four Ultraman (Ultraman Z, Ultraman Zero, Ultraman Geed, and Ultraman Belial), the earbuds offer 14 modes, including six duo modes that highlight the strength of their bonds.
        
        With over 350 voice lines, this dream collaboration of legendary heroes comes to life right in your ears.

        &lt;b&gt;Special Design&lt;/b&gt;
        The earbuds and charging case design are inspired by the anti-kaiju robot force “STORAGE” and feature colors matching the unit insignia. While embracing a military aesthetic, the metallic gold accents evoke the Power of Light and the Rise Ultra Medals, capturing the heroic spirit of the Ultra heroes.

        &lt;li&gt;AVIOT, operated by Preseed Japan Corporation, which manufactures and sells consumer electronics, has opened pre-orders for the TE-Q3-KSR true wireless earbuds, created in collaboration with the anime The Apothecary Diaries. Based on the TE-Q3, this special edition features an original design inspired by the anime and newly recorded voice lines from Maomao and Jinshi.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Product Characteristics&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Base Model&lt;/b&gt;
        This collaboration model is based on the TE-Q3, the latest entry in AVIOT’s Q Series, which has shipped approximately 320,000 units*1. Despite being one of the most compact active noise canceling earbuds on the market*2, the TE-Q3 offers up to 11.5 hours of playback on a single charge and up to 42 hours with the charging case. The ear tips are made from skin-friendly, medical-grade silicone*3. In addition to its robust core features, the TE-Q3 is equipped with 10 mm dynamic drivers for high-quality audio, making it a well-balanced model that excels in design, usability, and sound.
        
        *1 As of April 2025
        *2 Based on the combined dimensions of all three sides of the charging case for true wireless earbuds with ANC
        *3 Use of medical-grade silicone does not guarantee the absence of allergic reactions in all individuals
        
        &lt;b&gt;Special Voice Lines&lt;/b&gt;
        The earbuds include 76 newly recorded voice lines, featuring both guidance for power and connection notifications and a “random voice” feature with quotes from the anime. In addition to separate Maomao and Jinshi modes, there’s also a combined Maomao &amp; Jinshi mode where the two characters interact, letting you enjoy their charming back-and-forth, just like in the anime.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Special Design&lt;/b&gt;
        The earbuds and charging case feature an elegant olive green and gold color scheme that exudes a premium feel. The logo, inspired by medicinal herbs, subtly captures the world of The Apothecary Diaries. 
        
        The multi-layer coating and rubber finish add a sophisticated touch, making the design both stylish and practical for everyday use.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;AVIOT, operated by Preseed Japan Corporation, which manufactures and sells consumer electronics, has opened pre-orders for the TE-Q3-BSF true wireless earbuds, created in collaboration with the visual novel BUSTAFELLOWS. Based on the TE-Q3, this special edition features a total of 150 newly recorded voice lines by the protagonist Teuta and five male characters, exclusive new illustrations by artist Kohaku Sumeragi, and sound tuning by KENN.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;From the packaging and design to the voice guidance and sound tuning, the TE-Q3-BSF has been fully customized in tribute to BUSTAFELLOWS.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The packaging features brand-new artwork by series illustrator Kohaku Sumeragi, and the earbuds themselves capture the distinctive atmosphere of the visual novel. In addition to the protagonist Teuta, five male characters working behind the scenes in New Sieg provide voice guidance. With seven modes in total, including a duo mode with character interactions, the earbuds feature over 150 newly recorded voice lines, along with sound tuning supervised by KENN, making them a must-have for fans of the series.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Product Characteristics&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Base Model&lt;/b&gt;
        This collaboration model is based on the TE-Q3, the latest entry in AVIOT’s Q Series, which has shipped approximately 320,000 units*1. Despite being one of the most compact active noise canceling earbuds on the market*2, the TE-Q3 offers up to 11.5 hours of playback on a single charge and up to 42 hours with the charging case. The ear tips are made from skin-friendly, medical-grade silicone*3. In addition to its robust core features, the TE-Q3 is equipped with 10 mm dynamic drivers for high-quality audio, making it a well-balanced model that excels in design, usability, and sound.
        
        *1 As of April 2025
        *2 Based on the combined dimensions of all three sides of the charging case for true wireless earbuds with ANC
        *3 Use of medical-grade silicone does not guarantee the absence of allergic reactions in all individuals
        
        &lt;b&gt;Special Voice Lines&lt;/b&gt;
        In addition to voice guidance for notifications like power and connection status, these earbuds feature a “random voice” function that plays memorable lines from the game alongside original conversations, for a total of 150 newly recorded lines. 
        
        There are seven modes in total—six solo modes where each character whispers directly in your ear, and one duo mode featuring conversations between Teuta and the male characters. You can switch between them anytime via the app. Relive iconic lines from the game, brought vividly to life right by your ears!
        
        Sample voice clips will be released on the product page. Be sure to check them out!
        
        Voice line samples are available on the product page:

        &lt;b&gt;Special Design&lt;/b&gt;
        A deep black paired with the gold that symbolizes BUSTAFELLOWS. This chic yet glamorous color scheme is designed to evoke the nights of New Sieg. The earbuds and charging case feature the series’ logo, creating a device that balances everyday usability with the appeal of a fan collectible.

        &lt;li&gt;Hatsune Miku “Magical Mirai 2025” is an event that combines 3DCG live performances by Miku Hatsune and other virtual singers with an exhibition that allows visitors to experience the joy of creativity. A Blu-ray and DVD of the full final night show in Tokyo will be released on February 4, 2026.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;This year marks the 13th iteration of the event, which was held under the theme “Starry River in the Sky.” It took place at Sendai Sun Plaza (Sendai venue) from August 1 to August 3, at INTEX Osaka (Osaka venue) from August 9 to August 11, and at Makuhari Messe (Tokyo venue) from August 29 to August 31. This was the first time the event was held in Sendai.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Both the regular and limited editions contain a full recording of the final night show in Tokyo. The limited edition bonus discs include the daily songs not performed on this night as well as a video titled “Focus on Singers,” which contains footage focusing exclusively on the virtual singers.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The package visuals will feature the main event artwork illustrated by Tiv.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Singer-songwriter mekakushe will release her digital album 138-Oku Nen Me no Koi on November 7, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The album’s concept is “the universe.” Centered on tracks inspired by planets, galaxies, and cosmic imagery, it includes mekakushe’s first anime tie-in: “Retronym of Love,” the ending theme of Kowloon Generic Romance, plus insert songs “My Own Polaris” and “Yuwanamerou.” This is one of Mekakushe’s most ambitious works to date. &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;To mark her birthday on July 26, she released “Zutto Emerald” from the album for early streaming. The song blends hope and melancholy in a dreamy electro tune with a floating feel. Written and composed by mekakushe, it was arranged by Tomggg, who also worked on “Kimi wa Snorkel.” The cover art and music video were created by pixel artist Nanami Yuki.

        &lt;h2&gt;Mekakushe’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        “Love is wonderful. I’m so glad I finally realized it.
        Enough to wipe away everything that came before.”
        I’m honestly amazed that a day has come when I truly want to write lyrics full of hope like this.
        That’s the symbolic meaning of an emerald.
        The 1/f fluctuation—since water and music are alike, they’re both cold and warm at the same time.
        Tomggg arranged the sound to make it feel that way.
        It’s a secret that this song continues the story of “Kimi wa Snorkel.”
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Tomggg’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        With “Kimi wa Snorkel,” the music felt like floating and diving underwater. In this new song, “Zutto Emerald,”  you can imagine happily floating and swimming around with cute floaties. I hope the music captures the feeling of a pool of happiness and the unique sparkle of emerald, expressing all kinds of light through sound.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Yuki Nanami’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        From the moment I first heard it, images of being gently rocked by emerald water and floating softly in space came to mind, sparking a flood of ideas that made creating the illustrations very enjoyable.
        It’s a soft, happy song, but with a hint of sadness that makes you want to listen to it again and again. I’m very happy to be involved in the music video. It’s been a wonderful experience!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Tomggg’s Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
        A prolific arranger who has collaborated on projects with all kinds of artists within Japan and abroad, such as Kaho Nakamura, Chelmico, Haruno, Harmoe, Daoko, Shelheil, and Ena Mori, to name a few. His reach has since gotten even wider with the release of “Nante ne” in a recent commercial for Pokari Sweat.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Tokyo (November 3, 2025)- The &quot;HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-&quot; movie (hereafter referred to as &quot;HypMovie&quot;) began its revival screening at 66 theaters across Japan starting September 2nd, HypMic&apos;s anniversary, to commemorate the 8th anniversary of the project&apos;s launch. With the revival, HypMovie has finally surpassed the major milestone of 2 billion yen in box office revenue.&lt;/li&gt; 
        
        &lt;li&gt;HypMovie is Japan&apos;s &quot;first&quot; interactive movie and made its screen debut on February 21st, 2025 at 85 theaters in Japan. Due to the limited amount of interactive screening equipment, the movie continued its run at a limited number of 60 to 80 theaters in Japan. While there have been many movies in the past that started with small-scale releases of around 10 theaters, gained popularity and expanded to over 150 theaters to become major hits, HypMovie has become the first movie in Japan to surpass a box office revenue of 2 billion yen with fewer than 100 theaters from its opening day. (Source: Kogyo Tsushinsha)&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;One of the reasons the movie has been such a hit is due to its interactive nature, the first of its kind in Japan, and which plays a central role in the viewing experience. The outcome of each rap battle unfolding on the screen is decided by the audience via a specialized voting system carried out via smartphone. Viewers vote during the movie a total of 5 times to determine the winner of each battle, which means there are a total of 48 different ways the movie can play out and 7 different endings.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Furthermore, to commemorate the movie&apos;s success, the specially-produced video &quot;Claim Victory (Immersive Edition)&quot;—which is being shown at the &quot;HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-&quot; exhibition currently in Nagoya—has been uploaded to the official Hypnosis Mic YouTube channel for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The video encapsulates the intensity of the final Division Rap Battle during the movie and is a must-see for any HypMic fan. It will only be available until September 7th 23:59 JST, so don&apos;t miss it.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The battle continues in theaters where HypMovie continues to be shown, and audiences in Japan have the opportunity to get their hands on some limited bonus items. As the 11th round of bonuses, “clear cards” featuring new illustrations by the Hypnosis Mic character designer Kazui will be given out to moviegoers. 2 sets of 3 designs will be randomly distributed, the first of which is Buster Bros!!!/MAD TRIGGER CREW/Fling Posse, which will be given out until September 12th, followed by the Matenro/DOTSUITARE-HOMPO/Bad Ass Temple version from September 13th until September 19th. Both are exclusive to theaters, so if you&apos;re in the area, be sure to check out the revival screenings. For theater details, check the dedicated webpage &quot;NOVELTY&quot; on the official HypMovie website.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Additionally, part of the latest round of live HypMic events featuring HypMic cast members &quot;HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle- 11th LIVE &lt;Final D.R.B.&gt;&quot; (hereafter referred to as 11th Live), will be livestreamed in theaters in Japan alongside HypMovie. These special &quot;Live Viewing&quot; screenings will include a live broadcast of part of the stage performances before the movie screening, and will include the opening greeting from the cast on-stage.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Tickets for Fling Posse &amp; Matenro&apos;s performance on September 6th are currently on sale. Tickets for MAD TRIGGER CREW &amp; DOTSUITARE-HOMPO&apos;s performance on September 20th go on sale on September 13th, and tickets for Buster Bros!!! &amp; Bad Ass Temple&apos;s October 4th performance goes on sale on September 27th. Check the official HypMovie website for information regarding participating theaters. &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;All 6 of the 11th Live performances will be livestreamed by ABEMA exclusively on their “Abema PPV” platform, with tickets currently on sale. In addition to the standard ticket which will stream footage from the main camera only, a special “multi-angle” ticket is also on sale, which allows you to freely choose between the “upper camera”, “lower camera” and “full-view camera” during the stream. PPV viewers can also enjoy special bonus content: an “I’m Home” video of the cast members recorded right after the performance, where they will talk to the camera about their thoughts and feelings directly after the show. All 6 performances can only be watched in their entirety on “Abema PPV”, so don’t miss out!&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
        Music-based character rap project Hypnosis Mic: started in September 2017
        Hypnosis Mic features 18 unique characters who are divided into 6 teams: Ikebukuro Division, &quot;Ikebukuro Division,&quot; &quot;Yokohama Division,&quot; &quot;Shibuya Division,&quot; &quot;Shinjuku Division,&quot; &quot;Osaka Division,&quot; and &quot;Nagoya Division,&quot; where they engage in intense rap battles. 
        
        Leading figures in Japan&apos;s hip hop scene are featured as creators in the tracks used for each rap battle. Each character&apos;s voice actor performs all their own songs, and so each character&apos;s story develops through the music.
        
        The world of Hypnosis Mic has been explored across a range of media, including manga, video games, stage plays, anime and more, all based on its strongly characteristic music and narrative audio dramas.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What’s the MOVIE?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &quot;HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-&quot; is Japan&apos;s &quot;first&quot; audience-participation style interactive movie.
        
        The outcome of each rap battle unfolding on the screen is decided by the audience vote. Voting is conducted in real-time through the smartphone app &quot;CtrlMovie&quot; system by Kino Industries, and the story progresses based on the outcome of these votes.
        
        The movie’s story and ending shift with each screening depending on the choices of each audience member, making each screening unique...
        The first-ever interactive movie experience in the history of Japanese cinema.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Introducing Interactive Movie System &quot;CtrlMovie&quot;&lt;/b&gt;
        HypMovie&apos;s interactive aspects are brought to you by &quot;CtrlMovie&quot;, an interactive movie system by Kino Industries.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The popular adventure game Hito no Calendar came to an end Sunday, August 31. Following the conclusion of the game, multi-talented singer, voice actress, and actress Nonoka Obuchi released the game’s theme song “Hachigatsu no Afterglow” as her new digital single at midnight on September 1.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Hito no Calendar is the latest installment in the Hito no Wallet series by D4KK(Daiyonkyokai), a group of creators that weave stories in the space between reality and virtuality. It went on sale on the official online shop in May.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The game is described as “a web-based adventure game that begins with a young girl’s calendar.” The story would develop in real time until Sunday, August 31 when it reached its ending. The ending theme song was revealed at that moment as Nonoka Obuchi’s “Hachigatsu no Afterglow.”&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;In tandem with the game’s conclusion, “Hachigatsu no Afterglow” was promptly released as a digital single at midnight Monday, September 1. The single marks her very first grand ballad, featuring emotional vocals and the sound of live instruments that bring the scenes to life in a way that will leave a lasting impression on listeners.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;A digital jacket design was released alongside the single featuring an illustration that was used in the game. Listeners can check out the design on the official audio.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Singer-songwriter majiko, who has garnered over 200 million streams across Asia and more than 580,000 YouTube subscribers, released her new song “Nande?” on August 22. This follows the release of “NA TTE NAI” on July 18. Both tracks will be part of her upcoming digital EP GOLDEN JUNKIE, set to release on October 17.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Written, composed, and arranged entirely by majiko, “Nande?” marks a shift from the beat-driven style of “NA TTE NAI,” featuring primarily live instruments. A catchy pop tune, it is anchored by the repeated chorus phrase “Nande?” (“Why?”). The music video, illustrated by Messy Nyasuppeno—who also created the visuals for “Teddy”—was released on the same day as the song.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;It has been announced that singer and voice actress Nao Toyama will be singing “Namida no Recipe,” the ending theme song for Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi: Ni. This news comes weeks after it was announced that her single “Tooryanse” was chosen as the opening theme song. It will be released November 5th on the same CD as the new single. In addition, there will be a special live stream Friday, August 29th at 9PM (JST) to celebrate!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The song was written and composed by hit-maker Masayoshi Oishi. This upbeat pop song with a Japanese twist that stays true to the lively and unique world of Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi, where supernatural beings and humans dwell together and explore themes such as “connection” and “belonging.” On the other hand, the ending theme song explores the main character, Aoi Tsubaki’s feelings towards her Odanna in a warm and heartfelt ballad by Tota Kasamura (LIVE LAB).&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Additionally, a new photo of Nao Toyama pays homage to the original photo used during the initial announcement of Toyama’s tie-in with the anime seven years ago. While the photo evokes memories of the past, Nao appears to embody “maturity” and “change.” &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Limited first edition copies of the single will include select recordings from Nao Toyama’s solo live concert “Watashi no Kangaeta Muteki na Setlist!” on Blu-Ray. These valuable recordings were chosen by Nao Toyama herself for the single. The limited anime edition will include an original illustrated CD cover and a special variety program “Nao’s Kitchen” featuring Nao Toyama recreating the dishes served in Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi: Ni as well.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Don’t miss out on these charming theme songs and spectacular extras included in the gorgeous new single!&lt;/li&gt;

        Anime NYC 2025 has come and gone so quickly! Every year, we have to wait till Anime NYC arrives again and begin to prepare. We grab our notepads, think about how to tackle all that’s within the convention halls, and ready our wallets to be emptied by the merchandise we’ll buy and the food we’ll devour! It’s hard not to feel like, when this convention finally starts, it’s over in the blink of an eye...
        
        That being said, we attended 4 days of Anime NYC 2025 and had quite a few experiences, some good and others bad, and that’s why we once more present to you all our post-show field report to entertain you! Read all about our various trials and tribulations, as well as some of the shining moments of this year’s Anime NYC! Now, let’s relive Anime NYC 2025!

        While the prices have risen pretty dramatically, Anime NYC 2025 was larger than previous years and had a lot more events and big name guests. The prices might be a bit hard to stomach for some but again, it was kind of unavoidable.

        &lt;h2&gt;What Anime NYC 2025 Did Better Than Before&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-paragraph mt30&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        In comparison to 2024, Anime NYC 2025 had a lot more to explore. There were plenty of booths, from VTUBERS such as Hololive, where fans of various VTUBERs could join together, sing with them, listen to their randomness, and just enjoy a dedicated gaming hall where various tournaments were being held, like Tekken 8, Street Fighter 6, and even Super Smash Bros! Famous YouTubers like IronMouse and CDAWG VA were there too (sadly, we couldn’t watch them due to time constraints), and that was pretty neat!
        
        There were also a slew of popular voice actors out there for meetups, interviews, and fan questions. Needless to say, this Anime NYC was without a doubt the most varied one to date. Regardless of what type of otaku you are, Anime NYC 2025 had you covered!
        
        There were plenty of booths this year, ensuring a bit more variety than past outings. There was the Hololive stage, where fans of various VTUBERs could join their favorites, sing with them—they performed numerous anime and popular English songs—listen to them talk about silly topics, and even join in as if they were part of the group! Almost every day, Hololive was the loudest event by far, showing just how passionate those fans are.
        
        Those who wanted a more typical anime con affair could scour the floors for merchandise from numerous vendors, like Yen Press, Good Smile Company, Viz Media, and plenty of others. But with how pricey Anime NYC 2025 was, this certainly would stretch your savings a bit. We’d be lying if we didn’t admit we got a ton of figures ourselves, but it was well worth it to show our support to our favorite vendors.
        
        Gaming otaku weren’t left in the dark at Anime NYC 2025! There was a big emphasis on games this year, with an entire floor dedicated to hosting gaming events. Con-goers could play against others in their favorite fighting games like Tekken 8, Street Fighter 6, and even Super Smash Bros! There were also card game tables for all the favorites, like Magic the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and so on. We even heard that some popular YouTubers like IronMouse and CDawgVA were playing games with the crowd! Due to time constraints, we couldn’t see them ourselves, but from the fan roars, we know they were enjoying the event!
        
        Lastly, there were quite a few panels and voice actor meetups available! Famous voice talent like Kaiji Tang, Christopher Sabat, Aleks Le, AMALEE, and others were there to talk to con-goers, sign merch, or take photos! There were also plenty of panels where con-goers could learn more about numerous industry themes and/or upcoming projects. It would be impossible to see and experience everything in one day, let alone four, but at the very least, you couldn’t say there was nothing to do at Anime NYC 2025! 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- /.wrap-unit --&gt;

        &lt;!-- /options --&gt;		
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What Anime NYC 2025 Could Have Done Slightly Better&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-paragraph mt30&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Unfortunately, Anime NYC 2025 wasn’t without its drawbacks. The first—and most glaring—was overcrowding. We here at Honey’s Anime have been to our fair share of conventions, large and small, and Anime NYC 2025 is a medium-sized one compared to the titan that is Anime Expo. Nevertheless, it was clear that there was either no limit on how many could attend or a false expectation of how many would show up. Lines affected almost everything at the con, from food stalls and vendors to meeting some of the guests. The lines for food stalls were so long at times that they spilled into the non-food vendor areas, which was just terrible. Equally, seeing some of the guests was a nightmare, as lines could go on so long that it would be either impossible to meet them—unless you were there early enough—or by the time you worked your way up to the guest, they were on break or done with their time slot. Seriously, Anime NYC 2026 needs to consider capping ticket amounts or opening more of the Javits Center so there’s more room.
        
        Another issue was the lack of big gaming vendors. Despite scouring the floor, we really only saw a few minor ones. Don’t get us wrong—we were more than thrilled to see Honor of Kings with their Detective Conan collaboration and Kaiju No.8, which we could play briefly—it looks and plays incredibly well for a mobile/Steam game. Yet, we were expecting some bigger gaming panels, maybe from Capcom or even SEGA. We get that this is an anime convention, but it does have a lot of gamers who attend, and we would have liked some more gaming content.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-paragraph mt30&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        As you can see, there was a lot of cosplay, but we always try to look for the more unique ones. In our gallery, there are the usual cosplayers, but we are very happy to include some funny and stylish ones from Anime NYC 2025! All cosplayers who had individual photos taken were asked for permission beforehand, so thank you all for posing for Honey’s Anime! Hopefully next year we’ll see even more from newer anime airing!

        Anime NYC 2025 was great despite some issues here and there. In our opinion, more people attending shows a greater appreciation for the convention, which is wonderful—but it also means that more of the Javits Center should be opened to help remedy the crowd. All things considered, we had a great time and would love to thank Anime NYC 2025 for allowing us the privilege to attend as press once again! We hope to see you all at Anime NYC 2026, which will no doubt happen after the success of this year! For now, though, we’re going to rest our tired wings and take a much-deserved nap…

        Misunderstandings - created at a glance, but difficult to get rid of. Two people are caught in the midst of them, fighting to find a place for themselves. For Maribell Schuzen, stumbling upon the Grimoire of Lies meant being labeled as a Witch, a follower of the slain Demon Lord and enemy of the entire world. For Snazzy-chan, a popular streamer and otaku extraordinaire, a new fate has him wrapped up with tentacles. Tentacles, you say? Why, Snazzy is now a jellyfish of all things!
        
        “But don’t worry, Snazzy is a gentlemanly jellyfish!”
        
        Swearing to protect Maribell with all that his little body can do, Snazzy will show the world that keeping a Witch wrapped up is preferable to a dead Witch!

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;SANDA, by Paru Itagaki (creator of BEASTARS), is an unconventional Santa Claus action series set in near-future Japan, where extreme measures are taken to protect children amid a sharp population decline. The anime premieres in Japan on October 3, 2025, with exclusive worldwide streaming on Prime Video beginning October 4 at 2:53 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Today, the main visual and full promotional video were released. The main visual depicts Daikoku Welfare Academy, where protagonist Sanda and his classmates study, with school principal Hifumi Oshibu—who exerts extreme control over the children—looming in the background. Santa Claus dramatically bursts through glass, symbolizing hope in a bleak future.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The reveal also introduces key characters and cast: Toshihiko Seki voices 92-year-old principal Oshibu, who obsessively clings to youth through repeated full-body plastic surgery, and Hiroaki Hirata plays Saburo Yagiuda, ace of the St. Nick Pursuit Unit dedicated to capturing Santa. Comments from both voice actors are included below.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The promotional video, showcasing Science SARU’s dynamic animation, portrays a world where children are tightly controlled and Santa is freed from a curse through wishes. It also features the first voice lines from the newly revealed characters Oshibu and Yagiuda.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The opening and ending themes have also been announced. The opening theme, “Childlike Adults,” is by yama, and the ending theme, “Diary,” is by Soushi Sakiyama. Comments from both artists are included below.

        &lt;h2&gt;New Characters and Voice Cast Revealed, with Comments!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Hifumi Oshibu (Voiced by Toshihiko Seki)&lt;/h3&gt;
        The 92-year-old principal of Daikoku Welfare Academy, where Sanda and his classmates study. Obsessed with youth, he repeatedly undergoes full-body plastic surgery. He has an extreme dislike of adults and goes to abnormal lengths to protect and monitor his students’ every move.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt;
        1. How did you feel when you were cast as Oshibu in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?
        Of all Paru Itagaki’s works, SANDA was one I was especially interested in. And among her many characters, Hifumi Oshibu’s personality stands out. I approached the role with a fresh mindset to fully capture his unique presence. Please look forward to it!
        
        2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?
        If Santa Claus were like the one in this series, every Christmas would be far more exciting! But if a real Santa Claus existed, I think I’d ask him to promise a future where children everywhere can live in safety.

        Major roles: Muzan Kibutsuji in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Medama Oyaji in Birth of Kitaro: The Mystery of GeGeGe, and Hansuke Doi in Nintama Rantaro
        
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Saburo Yagiuda (Voiced by Hiroaki Hirata)&lt;/h3&gt;
        The ace of the St. Nick Pursuit Unit dedicated to capturing Santa. Twenty years ago, he inflicted a serious injury on Santa Claus.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt;
        1. How did you feel when you were cast as Yagiuda in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?
        Although my character only appears partway through the story, I was warmly welcomed and had a great time recording. These days, there aren’t many productions where we go out drinking after recording, but with this one, everyone’s a heavy drinker, and I got dragged out until late at night every time. I’m counting on you, Murase!
        
        2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?
        Although I’m over 60, I’m still full of worldly desires. I think I’d ask Santa to help me become the kind of person who can say, “I have nothing more to wish for.”

        &lt;h2&gt;Opening Theme Song&lt;/h2&gt;
        “Childlike Adults” by yama (Sony Music Labels Inc.)
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from yama&lt;/h2&gt;　　　
        What does it mean to be an adult? Simply growing older does not necessarily make you one. Likewise, I do not believe that being young automatically makes someone a child.
        Silently carrying pain is both weakness and fragility, and facing it alone might be a clumsy way of avoiding reality.
        I once thought there was virtue in growing older while holding onto that fragility. But in recent years, whether with people close to me or through music, I have gradually begun to open my heart.
        The line between myself and others has not changed, yet through connecting with others I discover new sides of myself. I do not think of myself as either an adult or a child, but rather believe that people possess both qualities at any age.
        It is not about clinging to one side or deciding what is right or wrong. I have simply realized that I want to trust someone, and that is also a way of trusting myself.
        To anyone else who feels caught between the two, I hope this reaches you.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Ending Theme Song&lt;/h2&gt;
        “Diary” by Soushi Sakiyama (Sony Music Labels Inc.)
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from Soushi Sakiyama&lt;/h2&gt;
        I’m honored to perform the ending theme. I felt a deep connection to Kazushige’s inner struggle, caught between adulthood and childhood, and I poured those emotions into the song. In a world without clear answers, where each person’s idea of justice collides, the way Kazushige moves forward with so many voices in his heart has moved me time and again. I hope you enjoy the song together with the anime.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ELLEGARDEN’s latest single “Carmine” was released digitally on August 10. Their first new work in about three years—following their sixth album The End of Yesterday in 2022—the track was written as the opening theme for the TV anime ONE PIECE. This is the first time in the band’s history that they have created a song specifically for an anime.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The offer to create the opening theme was extended to vocalist and guitarist Takeshi Hosomi, a longtime fan of the series, leading to the collaboration. The song was released at 11:45 p.m., immediately after the episode in which it first aired.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The opening video is now available on the official ONE PIECE YouTube channel. The music video for “Carmine” will premiere on ELLEGARDEN’s official YouTube channel at 11:45 p.m. on August 17.

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Nao Toyama’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        It was my pleasure to sing the theme song “Tooryanse” for the sequel of Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi. Thank you! Seven years ago, “Tomoshibi no Manimani” became one of my signature songs and a frequent number during my live concerts, still loved by fans until this day. Masayoshi Oishi’s killer track “Tooryanse” captures the bizarre and lively feeling of living alongside demons in the world of Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi. I hope that this song will become a treasure that everyone can treasure together! Please enjoy!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Masayoshi Oishi’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        I had the pleasure of writing and composing the opening theme song “Tooryanse!” I had always wanted to write a song for Nao Toyama and for a popular series like Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi, so I was incredibly happy when I was approached for this song! I wanted to create something lively with a distinct Japanese sound that was powerful and exotic. I hope this track brings  a little something extra to the work!

        A surge of excitement radiated through the Entertainment Hall,  and for those attendees who visited, it was common to hear the thrilling chant of “3… 2… 1… Let it RIP!!” echoing through the venue. It was an instant attention-grabber for fans young and old who had ever watched the anime or played Beyblade themselves. Impossible to miss, the Beyblade championship arena drew in thousands of spectators over the four days of the convention. On Saturday, July 5, the tournament reached its final stage, attracting 128 competitors who made history by participating in the first official U.S. Open-Class single-elimination showdown.    &lt;/p&gt;

        The Entertainment Hall erupted with intense cheering for ElenaBEY, who secured her ticket to Tokyo this October for the global finals. But she wasn’t the only one being celebrated. The crowd was going wild for all eight top competitors who delivered thrilling action throughout the day.
        
        We had the opportunity to do a quick interview with the top 3, and this is what they had to say:

        &lt;b&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I came all the way from Texas to win. I was waiting since 2018 for this moment and the experience was insane; I’m just really happy to get to compete. 
        &lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; How did you hear about this tournament at AX, and was this your first time in a tournament? 
        &lt;b&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I’m a content creator who focuses on competitive Beyblade so of course I knew about this and I’ve been in 32 tournaments just in the past 6 months to make it here. 
        &lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; After today’s defeat, do you plan on changing your strategy?
        &lt;b&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I plan to constantly change my style as always, trying out different styles of my interest.

        &lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; We’ve noticed you have quite a fan following among the crowd. Do you have a few words to share with your fans?
        &lt;b&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; SoCal is still strong.  We need more tournaments, more opportunities to give a chance to more players. Don’t stop playing until Beyblade becomes an e-sport! Until then, we need to take care of each other. I hope everyone had fun watching my matches and that I could deliver what the crowd wanted to see.

        &lt;b&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; Now I feel proud to represent women in Beyblade, not only as the U.S. champion. I want to show that Beyblade is for everyone, and I hope my win influences more women to join the world of Bey.
        &lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; Did you come to this tournament focused on winning?
        &lt;b&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; I never expected to reach the top, or win! My friends helped me out with the knowledge of what Beyblade to pick, they helped me a lot through the preliminaries so I feel this win is for everyone who helped me. I am surprised I won!
        &lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; Were you surprised that the champion would have a chance to trip to Japan to join the BEYBLADE X World Championship 2025?
        Is this your first time going?
        &lt;b&gt;A:&lt;/b&gt; No, it wasn’t a surprise. People were talking about the chance to compete in the World Championship in Japan. It’s not my first time in Japan, but I’m really looking forward to the shopping and food in Tokyo!
        &lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; Any final words for your fans?
        A: The most important thing is to have fun and keep playing!

        At Anime Expo 2025, Honey’s Anime sat down with famous director Goro Taniguchi, best known for Code Geass, to talk about his latest experimental work as the creative producer for Enter the Garden, an original anime produced by Azuki in collaboration with Dentsu. Known for its unique blend of American streetwear aesthetics and traditional Japanese visuals, Enter the Garden marks a bold departure from Japan’s traditional anime production model. Taniguchi shared his thoughts on creative freedom, artistic philosophy, and how Azuki’s community is reshaping what it means to create anime.

        &lt;strong&gt;
        You&apos;ve worked within the traditional Japanese pipeline of transforming an idea into anime. How has your experience differed working with Azuki, especially given their focus on short-format anime and changing how anime is produced?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        In the past, I usually worked with stories that already existed. This time working with Azuki, there was no original material to reference. So the process started with me asking, “Is this the right path?” and then presenting my ideas to Azuki. Sometimes those ideas were rejected, but the key has been constant communication between us. I’ve had to understand Azuki’s goals and translate that into animation. This open, cross-partner dialogue is very different from working with Japanese publishers or studios that produce anime, manga, or light novels in a traditional format. So far, it’s been a refreshing and exciting change for me.		
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;
        Enter the Garden seems to be inspired heavily by modern American street fashion and traditional Japanese elements. Could you tell me more about what inspired the look and aesthetic of the world?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        As I mentioned earlier, we first asked the Azuki side to show us what kind of things they were thinking about and wanted to do, as well as what kinds of fan art existed. From there, we picked out the parts of their ideas that we understood or that we also thought were cool. Staff members who understood the concept arranged everything in the form of Episode 1, Episode 2, and Episode 3.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        Are there plans to introduce other cultural aspects from different countries in future episodes?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!--Sōhei Matsuura hex--&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        That’s something I intentionally avoid. Digging deeper into the reasoning, the staff working on the project had already had that kind of idea in the past; however, we have agreed on focusing on one style identity with room for subtle influences. If I direct that they should include other cultural references, it may hinder the staff’s creativity. That’s something I would like to avoid. I believe that giving the team creative freedom yields better results. I purposely place staff who can generate something good without being influenced. To give more details, for episode 1, I assigned staff who had worked on things other than anime. In episode 2, I assigned staff who could also illustrate the 1980s to 2000s era’s anime style. By doing this, I can ensure each episode has its own uniqueness.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        What can you tell me about the character’s personality? Are they in any way influenced by Azuki’s company philosophy or your vision as a director?			&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        As for episode 1, the world setting is Azuki’s idea but the characters were created under our direction. In episode 2, we featured Azuki’s original characters, but I directed how they came to life on screen. Episode 3, which hasn’t been released yet, both the characters and the world were created as a way to further expand our interpretation of Azuki. 
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        When you talk about expanding in artwork and animation technique, in what way do you mean exactly? Are you talking about introducing techniques like rotoscopying or stop motion animation?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!--Sōhei Matsuura hex--&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex-rotate&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex-bg&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&apos;https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Goro-Taniguchi.jpg&apos;)&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        It’s not about technique for the sake of technique. It’s about philosophy and how to express an idea visually. If stop motion helps convey that concept, we’ll use it. But technique is secondary to intention. What matters most is expressing the underlying message in a compelling way.	
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;
        Between episodes 1 and 2 of Enter the Garden, there seems to have been some evolution regarding animation. How did Azuki grow during this process, and what did you learn?			&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        Absolutely, there’s been growth. Originally, I had my plans for episodes 2 and 3. But after finishing episode 1, Azuki suggested new ideas for episode 2, probably ideas that reflected community feedback. I didn’t see these suggestions as just coming from a company, but as a petition from the fans. So I made adjustments to my original vision. Anime is a business, yes, but it’s also for the fans. Their input helped shape the direction of the project.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Whatever message I want to convey can only be delivered through the anime itself. That’s why I create. What makes this project special is that it listens to the fans and translates their voice into animation. That’s what truly matters.

        &lt;strong&gt;	
        Are you hoping to bring more creators into the Azuki community, or is this anime laying the groundwork for something bigger?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        Whether it&apos;s from the wide anime community or Azuki’s community, if you are a creator, the more eyes on your work, the better. My goal isn’t just to cater to the Azuki community, it’s to reach the wider anime audience. By doing this, if that draws more people into Azuki, that’s something I can feel happy about. If that happens, you can say creating Enter the Garden anime was successful.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        Working with legends like Tatsuyuki Tanaka on Enter the Garden must be a unique experience. How do you foster an equal creative environment for industry veterans?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        The answer is very simple. As the director, I define clear creative boundaries. I explained the project and everyone’s responsibilities at the start. Mr. Tanaka understood exactly what his role was and where his creative domain lay. Once that’s clear, I don’t interfere unless someone steps outside their zone. That mutual respect is what keeps the environment clear of issues.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;  
        Goro Taniguchi’s approach to Enter the Garden reveals a balance between personal creative vision and open collaboration with both Azuki and its growing community. This experimental project isn’t just about breaking anime conventions in format and production, it’s about exploring how far you can go when fan voices, corporate goals, and experienced direction meet halfway. With more episodes on the horizon and an evolving aesthetic, Enter the Garden may just be a blueprint for a new era of anime production where creators like Taniguchi continue to innovate beyond borders.    
        &lt;/div&gt;

        At Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, Honey’s Anime had the opportunity to sit down with two key figures driving strategy and innovation in the world of collectible figures and character goods: Takayuki Miyauchi (Senior Assistant Manager of the Marketing Team in the Collector Business Group, Hobby Character Business Division) and Kenta Wakisawa (Assistant Manager of the R&amp;D Team in the same division).
        
        In our conversation, Miyauchi-san and Wakisawa-san offered a rare glimpse into the heart of the industry—and how they plan to keep surprising collectors worldwide.

        T-SPARK is described as a brand for adult hobbyists. What’s the vision behind creating a unified brand for adult hobbyists and has that vision evolved since its launch?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Wakisawa:&lt;/b&gt; Our division handles long-running IPs like Transformers and ZOIDS, and we’d already been developing products for a high-target demographic. So under the company-wide policy of increasing lifetime value and expanding customer segments, we decided to take the lead in expanding offerings for kidults (adults with a playful spirit).
        
        Although the toy and hobby businesses may seem similar, their structures differ significantly. So for this initiative, we assembled a project team that included members beyond just management and our division. Together, we held in-depth discussions, looking ten years ahead, on how our company should approach and expand the kidult market from a medium- to long-term perspective.
        
        Through those discussions, we realized that Takara TOMY now targets a wide spectrum of customers, from children to adults, and that this requires different approaches for each segment in both product development and marketing. In the hobby category especially, we recognized the need to clearly define and separate our kidult offerings. For instance, our official YouTube channel previously featured videos for both kids and adults, but to deliver more relevant content to each audience, shouldn’t we consider separating the channels?
        
        There are also differences in focus between children’s and adults’ products when it comes to quality and ethical standards, raising the need for distinct criteria. As we looked to expand the kidult segment over the medium to long term, it became clear that clearer boundaries were needed. That led to the decision to launch a separate label for kidult-focused collector items. This was the rationale behind T-SPARK, and our vision has remained unchanged since its launch.		
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;b&gt;Wakisawa:&lt;/b&gt; We only began expanding into the U.S. market in 2025, so we’re still in the early stages, testing various strategies to see what works. While overall trends in the U.S. market aren’t drastically different from those in Japan, action figures are a particularly strong category, and in recent years, Japanese IPs have become extremely popular. By leveraging that interest in Japanese culture and applying Takara TOMY’s hobby expertise, we aim to develop new products and build awareness of the T-SPARK brand. Our appearance at AX this time is part of that effort.
        
        Looking ahead, we plan to roll out a variety of collaboration products featuring popular manga, anime, and other globally loved content. We’re also working to strengthen our online presence, centered around our North American e-commerce platform, Tommy Plus. At the same time, we want to create more offline touchpoints, such as places where fans can see product samples in person.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;b&gt;Miyauchi:&lt;/b&gt; We believe that expanding the T-SPARK brand is essential to gaining traction with adult collectors. The new figure brands we’ve launched will offer a wide range of products, from affordable to high-end, designed to appeal to various fan demographics.
        
        SPARK Fig is a mid- to high-priced series targeting adult collectors, while the COLLEKAZARO series is designed not only for adult collectors but also to appeal to female fans.
        
        By offering a diverse range of products targeting a broad fan base, we hope to raise awareness of the T-SPARK brand among as many people as possible.

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;  
        Although brief, our conversation with Miyauchi-san and Wakisawa-san shed light on how Takara TOMY is shaping the future of its collector business through T-SPARK, a brand built with a playful spirit, yet crafted with the sophistication and quality adult fans expect. From the long-term vision that led to creating a distinct label, to early steps in expanding into the U.S. market, and the thoughtful strategies behind engaging multi-generational fandoms with lines like SPARK Fig and COLLEKAZARO, it’s clear that T-SPARK represents more than just figures—it’s a commitment to redefining what it means to collect, connect, and celebrate Japanese pop culture on a global scale.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Daoko’s new single “Zense wa Busho” is now streaming, marking her first release since the 2024 album Slash-&amp;-Burn. Written by Daoko and composed/arranged by Seiichi Nagai of QUBIT—where she also serves as lead vocalist—the track blends Nagai’s signature guitar work with Daoko’s playful voice and sharp wordplay. It delivers a kitschy, post-Shibuya-kei pop sound with a distinct “kawaii” vibe.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The jacket cover was done by Ace Akira, an artist known for combining pixel art and neon colors. It’s a striking piece of artwork that captures how the chaos of modern life and kawaii culture coexist. The lyric video, which uses the same visual, will be released in the coming days.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;A digital EP featuring “Zense wa Busho” will be released on November 19.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Daoko is set to embark on her first solo Asia tour, THE “YOU” ZIZAI ASIA TOUR 2025, beginning September 5 in Shenzhen and continuing through Shanghai, Bangkok, Taipei, Seoul, and Tokyo. The tour finale is scheduled for November 28 at Shibuya WWW X. Tickets for overseas shows and early access for the Tokyo concert are now available.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The tour’s title, combining “YOU” and “ZIZAI” (“freely”), reflects the theme of Slash-&amp;-Burn: clearing the old to make way for new growth. Daoko invites fans to join her in embracing a fresh phase of creative freedom across Asia.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Daoko’s Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
        Tokyo-born in 1997, Daoko rose to prominence at 15 with a song uploaded to Niconico Douga, making her major debut in 2015. Since then, she’s been active across music, anime, and commercial projects. Her hit collaboration with Kenshi Yonezu, “Uchiage Hanabi,” has surpassed 600 million views on YouTube. 
        
        A multi-talented creator, Daoko has also written novels, curated live events, exhibited paintings, and acted. She founded her own agency, Tefu Tefu, in 2019. In 2023, she became the lead vocalist of the band QUBIT and released her first solo album in four years, Slash-&amp;-Burn, in 2024. That same year, she was featured on Ringo Sheena’s seventh album. In 2025, Daoko has drawn further attention through her feature on Giga and TeddyLoid’s “Act,” followed by the July 23 digital release of her new single “Zense wa Busho.” A digital EP is set to follow on November 19.

        When King of Seas was first announced, the gaming world was all about pirates. Sea of Thieves, released last year, is a multiplayer experience that started with very little content but now has dozens of things to do and over ten thousand concurrent players. At first, Sea of Thieves and King of Seas were bound to compete, but after a few delays, King of Seas ended up debuting almost a year later. If you ask us, King of Seas is a better pirate game... but that&apos;s just us. If you like sea chants, sinking enemy ships, and role-playing as the meanest pirate to ever sail the oceans, here&apos;s another game you need to try!

        Honey’s Anime got the opportunity to try T-ARTS’s Gacha machines, and the process was very simple. First, exchange money for a special token directly at their booth, with prices starting at as low as five dollars per token. Next, browse through their large collection of Gacha machines, each featuring different toy collections from anime like Oshi No Ko, major IPs like Sanrio, or Japanese culture-inspired toys like convenience store snack models and cute Shiba Inu capsule toys. Celebrating its 60th anniversary in Japan in 2025, the Gacha area of the booth also offered visitors a hands-on experience with a free Gacha draw for those who shared their booth experience on social media.

        But more than the Gacha themselves, we were especially interested in their new blind box collection called “PERIHAPI!”, which they displayed onsite with adorable (and huge!) chibi figures featuring Vocaloid characters and cast members from the anime Haikyu!! We can’t wait for this collectible series to come to stores in the USA.

        The TOMY booth kept on giving, offering a huge collection of their movable model kits for adult hobbyists brought to us by T-SPARK, the unified brand for TOMY Company’s hobby products with various series. Starting strong with ZOIDS models, which impressed with their motorized series, and followed by TOYRISE’s Bang Bravern models for those who want more than just to collect, they want to build. Q VILLAGE was also there with its sleek line of deformed format vehicle models for Fast and the Furious and the legendary street-racing manga Initial D. The booth also featured a display of the SYNERGENEX crossover collection of Macross 7 × Transformers with Basara Prime model kits. And last but not least, the COLLEKAZARO brand showcased its My Hero Academia fully articulated collectible figures.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;On July 5, 2025, TOMY Company, Ltd. held the Open Class (ages 13+) of the BEYBLADE X National Tournament for the BEYBLADE X series (the modern version of “bei-goma” spinning tops) at the BEYBLADE X booth during Anime Expo 2025, North America’s largest anime and manga convention.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;This event was held to determine the top blader from the U.S. tournament who will advance to the BEYBLADE X WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 2025*, scheduled for October in Japan, the birthplace of Beyblade. On the morning of the event, a crowd of eager participants far exceeding the number of tournament spots gathered at the booth, filling the venue with the passion and energy of US bladers even before the matches began.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Before a packed crowd, the closely contested tournament ended with ElenaBEY emerging as the winner. In the finals, she initially conceded a point to Yushua, who scored a “Survivor Finish,” but she quickly turned the tables by earning two points of her own. Yushua then caught up, tying the score and turning the match into a fierce, back-and-forth battle. In the end, ElenaBEY sealed her comeback victory with a stunning “Xtreme Finish” using an Attack-Type Beyblade. The crowd erupted in cheers at the dramatic conclusion, bringing the tournament to an exciting close that perfectly showcased the thrill of BEYBLADE X.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;After securing her spot at the world championship, ElenaBEY was warmly congratulated by fellow competitors who had battled alongside her. She shared that she began playing Beyblade after a friend’s suggestion. Her victory in Los Angeles, the entertainment capital of the world, inspired many spectators who witnessed it.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;With its new “Xtreme Dash” gimmick enabling ultra-acceleration, BEYBLADE X is the fastest in the brand’s history. It has captured the hearts of both players and spectators, gaining popularity worldwide as a form of “GEAR SPORTS.” Bladers from 20 regions*, are scheduled to compete in the upcoming World Championship, and qualifiers are underway worldwide. Keep an eye out for ElenaBEY as she takes the stage alongside other Bladers who have battled their way to the top.
        
        *In some countries, only one division is held, either the Regular Class (ages 6 to 12) or the Open Class (which is also open to adults).&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comments From the Top 3&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Winner: ElenaBEY:&lt;/b&gt; 
        The friend who introduced me to Beyblade came to the venue today to cheer me on! I’m already excited to meet Bladers from around the world at the upcoming World Championship in Tokyo.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Runner-up: Yushua&lt;/b&gt;
        I missed out on the victory, but my next step is to expand the Beyblade community. I feel that Beyblade is exciting enough to be enjoyed like a sport.”
        
        &lt;b&gt;3rd Place: TMS&lt;/b&gt;
        I came all the way from Texas to join this tournament. I was waiting for this moment for several years, and I’m just really happy to get to compete. I always plan my strategy, and I’m going to try out different styles that interest me.

        &lt;li&gt;The opening theme song they’ve created evokes the feeling of youth and is overflowing with their unique style. A fitting song to mark their new beginning at Lantis. For the ending theme song, they collaborated with the anime’s heroine, Luna Ishikawa, voiced by Minami Tanaka. This special track is sure to draw attention as it deepens the show’s world-building. You can hear some snippets of the OP theme song “Seishun no Silhouette” (Youthful Silhouette) in the anime’s first promotional video.

        &lt;li&gt;Cornelius collaborated with various artists and filmmakers to release six full-sized music videos featuring songs from the Ghost in the Shell: Arise series, all of which are now available to stream on major platforms. Cornelius’ cutting-edge musical vision combined with the philosophical talent of these filmmakers pose striking questions for the modern age.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Utilizing diverse methods such as animation, live-footage, CG, and physical expression, the videos explore recurring themes from Ghost in the Shell: the uncertainty of existence, the fusion of city and body, and the relationship between humans and technology. The seamless blend of sound and visuals in this collection offers a new experience not only for fans, but for anyone with an interest in musical and visual expression.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Cornelius’s interview has also been published on the official Ghost in the Shell global website.&lt;/li&gt;

        Keigo Oyamada, a.k.a Cornelius, produced music for Ghost in the Shell: Arise for three years. He fuses acoustic instruments and electronic sounds to create a vision of a cyber-societal world with “the existence of soul” as the keyword. He talks about using his own style to create the soundtrack and theme song while staying true to the sci-fi nature of the work, and how that influenced his career as a musician.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A special event was held on July 13, in AEON LakeTown mori, to celebrate the release of the new opening and ending songs for the Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid movie!
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Kyoto Animation’s newest work is a heart-warming tale about family and the bonds that unite us. Miss Kobayashi&apos;s Dragon Maid: A Lonely Dragon Wants to Be Loved is the latest installment in the animated series, which started airing in 2017. Of course, seeing these popular scenes from the original work on the big screen has been a huge hit with the audiences!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;On July 13th (Sunday), fhána and Sachiko Kobayashi made an appearance at AEON LakeTown mori, to help kick off the release of their respective opening and ending songs, “Parade of Tears” and “Bokutachi no Hibi.” Since Koshigaya in Saitama Prefecture serves as the story’s backdrop, the location couldn’t have been more fitting.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Tickets for the priority viewing area (which came with the purchase of one of the CDs being released that day) sold out in a flash. The space was packed with spectators before the event even started. Since there might not be enough time during the concert itself, Kevin Mitsunaga (sampler, etc.) gave the crowd a primer on the choreography for “Parade of Tears” during their rehearsal, and asked them to lead the rest of the audience for the real deal.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About the Event&lt;/h2&gt;	
        The event itself started right at 1:00 p.m., with fhána’s performance of one of the definitive opening themes from the anime, “Rhapsody of Blue Sky.” Towana (vocalist) got the audience all fired up as her voice rang out from the stage, accompanied by Junichi Sato on the keyboard, and Kevin on the metallophone. The crowd sang and clapped along, clearly enjoying their amazing pop performance.
        
        Pausing just long enough to announce their group name, fhána launched straight into “Love Supreme!”, the opening song from Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid S. Towana and Kevin’s bright, bouncy rap makes it a memorable song, and their fast-paced repartee, mingled with the crowd’s applause, created an euphoric atmosphere.

        &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;inline-block&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;img-shadow&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        [sourceLink asin=&quot;&quot; asin_jp=&quot;&quot; cdj_product_id=&quot;&quot; text=&quot;&quot; url=&quot;&quot; ]
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- /options --&gt;
        
        During the MC segment, they mentioned that they were pleased to be visiting Koshigaya for the first time. And most people in attendance raised their hands when asked whether or not they’d seen the Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid movie. On seeing that, Junichi mentioned that their next song had been “inspired by Kanna’s (CV. Maria Naganawa) tears.” Then, Kevin gave the crowd a quick review of the choreography before launching straight into the movie’s opening theme, “Parade of Tears.” The crowd was quick to put those moves into action when the chorus came around. Though, for an upbeat pop song, there’s an element of melancholy to it.
        
        Since fhána has created each of the series’ opening songs, their lyrics and melodies have really stuck with the listeners. Junichi joined in the dancing partway through, livening up the performance even further—but was probably going to limit that to this event. (Or possibly the upcoming Animelo Summer Live event.) ”Yeah, I think that’s it for the dancing,” he said, mellowing the mood out.
        
        &lt;!-- options --&gt;
        &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;inline-block&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;img-shadow&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dragon-1209.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;560&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        [sourceLink asin=&quot;&quot; asin_jp=&quot;&quot; cdj_product_id=&quot;&quot; text=&quot;&quot; url=&quot;&quot; ]
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- /options --&gt;	
        
        This was the perfect transition into the ending theme’s portion of the event. The audience called out for “Kobayashi-saaan!” (just like the titular character), Sachiko Kobayashi took to the stage to sing “Bokutachi no Hibi.” The message there is that “Nothing is certain, but that’s easy to forget. We might have met here by accident, but that’s a kind of miracle. These precious moments ought to be cherished.” 
        
        Standing on stage in her stunning red dress, Sachiko’s gentle voice rang out, instantly catching everyone’s attention. Her voice couldn’t be better suited to a song that talks about how the “usual” things are the foundation of life. The performance was only a few minutes long, but it was a wonderfully moving piece that truly encapsulated the movie.
        
        After that touching finale to a rousing mini concert, fhána closed out the event by signing CDs that the fans had purchased.
        
        Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid: A Lonely Dragon Wants to be Loved is a huge hit! fhána and Sachiko Kobayashi’s opening and ending songs have gone on sale to great acclaim! Plus, it was okay to take pictures and videos at this event, so there are probably plenty of those to check out on social media.

        &lt;li&gt;Fans of anime, manga, games and cosplay from all over the world had the opportunity to attend a special double screening from King Records of &quot;HYPNOSIS MIC -Division Rap Battle- Movie&quot; and &quot;Uta no☆ Prince-sama♪ TABOO NIGHT XXXX&quot; at Anime Expo, the largest anime event in North America.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Here’s our report of the screening held at The Novo on Saturday afternoon!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-&lt;/h2&gt;
        I arrive at my second-floor front-row seat 15 minutes before showtime. While it doesn&apos;t seem too crowded, I look to the first floor front-row seats to see several groups of what appear to be fans in cosplay, checking their penlights. Looking at the screen, I see a QR code to download the app that will be used to determine each battle&apos;s winner, as well as how to vote during the screening. This won&apos;t be your typical theater experience — it&apos;s something entirely new, where the outcome of the movie lies in the hands of the audience.

        &lt;!-- /options --&gt;
        
        &quot;Hypnosis Mic -Division Rap Battle-&quot;, or &quot;HypMic&quot; for short, is a story set in a world where armed conflict is illegal, and territory is instead gained via rap battles using Hypnosis Mics, special microphones that interfere with human psyche. Teams representing each division compete in the &quot;Division Rap Battles&quot;, led by the all-female team Party of Words.
        
        Battles are fought in teams of 3, with 6 teams total:
        → Buster Bros!!!: Ikebukuro Division
        → MAD TRIGGER CREW: Yokohama Division 
        → Fling Posse: Shibuya Division
        → Matenro: Shinjuku Division
        → Bad Ass Temple: Nagoya Division
        → DOTSUITARE-HOMPO: Osaka Division

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- /options --&gt;	
        
        The team that wins the first and second stages will proceed to the final stage where they can challenge the Party of Words in battle. The full movie covers events up until the final stage, but for this specially-edited AX closing screening, only up until the second stage is shown.
        
        But what sets this movie experience apart is the mid-movie voting, done via a mobile app called CtrlMovie. After each battle&apos;s conclusion, a 10-second countdown begins on the app where viewers vote for the best-performing team by tapping the division&apos;s logo. After a few seconds, the winning team is displayed and the story continues.
        
        As the fate of each team is decided by the audience, even for those who might not call themselves fans, the tension in the room as the countdown begins is electric. As the result flashes on the screen, the audience erupts—united in a chorus of both joy and heartbreak that reverberates through the theater.
        
        The characters&apos; reactions and comments differ depending on the results, which makes every viewing a unique thrill. In total there are a whole 48 different ways the story can play out. Fans will watch them all, no doubt.
        
        I realize it&apos;s almost time for the movie to start and take a last look around behind me to see that the seats are now filled to overflowing, with even more people standing behind the last row. The first floor is of course also packed. Seeing this spectacle, I feel the excitement building as the MC stirs up the crowd. Then, the screening finally starts.
        
        Over the roars of the crowd, the first thing we see are clips introducing each division. Every team is met with screams of excitement, with the waving penlights changing color each time. I now realize that the pre-screening penlight checking was for this all-important color-changing operation. The introductions perfectly capture each team member&apos;s characteristics and their relationships with each other. Next is the opening video, where we get to hear everyone’s singing voices, and includes every character. The battleground is set. The cheers were so loud for every single division that I could not even guess which one might win.

        And now for the rap battles to begin!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;First stage, first battle&lt;/h2&gt;
        Buster Bros!!! Vs Bad Ass Temple
        The battle between Ichiro (Buster Bros!!! leader) and Kuko (Bad Ass Temple leader), who are former teammates, is a must-see. 
        
        Time for the vote of destiny. After a short silence, Buster Bros!!!’s logo appears on the screen, followed by loud cheering and crying.
        
        Up on the screen, Kuko approaches Ichiro and they congratulate one another. Fans cheer out warmly.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;First stage, second battle&lt;/h2&gt;
        MAD TRIGGER CREW Vs DOTSUITARE-HOMPO
        Samatoki (leader of MAD TRIGGER CREW) and Sasara (DOTSUITARE-HOMPO leader) were also once partners on the same team. They know each other inside out — every strength and every weakness. But today isn&apos;t a duel. It&apos;s a team battle, where the team that unites their strengths to the fullest seizes victory.
        
        Voting time again. A few seconds pass in silence before DOTSUITARE-HOMPO&apos;s logo flashes onto the screen. The crowd erupts.
        
        In the face of his loss, Samatoki speaks gracefully and the crowd’s comforting words left an impression.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;First stage, third battle&lt;/h2&gt;
        Fling Posse vs Matenro
        Ramuda (leader of Fling Posse) and Jakurai (Matenro&apos;s leader) say they hate one-another, but what is the truth...?
        
        During the battle their faces were so close they almost touched, which resulted in cheering and screaming throughout the venue every time.
        
        Once again it is time to vote, and after a short silence, Matenro&apos;s logo appears and is met with loud cheering and screaming.
        
        The resentment between the two leaders fades and Jakurai approaches Ramuda amicably, but Ramuda&apos;s irritation at Jakurai&apos;s unintentionally condescending remarks makes for an amusing conclusion.
        
        The second stage is a tournament between the three teams that won the first stage.
        
        Buster Bros!!! Vs DOTSUITARE-HOMPO vs Matenro
        
        Fate once again is in our hands, and this time the choice is between three teams. Cheers for each team echo across the venue, but it&apos;s DOTSUITARE-HOMPO who claim victory. The cheering and the screaming reach their climax.
        
        At long last, it&apos;s time for the final battle with Party of Words. The MC reappears and the screening comes to an end. While the winning division was not my first choice, the result made me very interested to see what a battle between the Kansai team DOTSUITARE-HOMPO and the all-female team Party of Words would look like.

        &lt;h2&gt;&quot;Uta no☆Prince-sama TABOO NIGHT XXXX&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
        After a (small) switch up in the audience between HypMic and Uta☆Pri fans, the MC introduces the next feature and turns the fans&apos; excitement all the way up! This movie is the third theatrical release for Uta☆Pri and contains a full-length live concert as well as a brand-new animation featuring QUARTET NIGHT.

        The audience cheered and changed the color of their penlights for each idol, and joined in every single idol call. And in perfect Japanese, of course.It was just like being at an idol concert in Japan.
        
        After seeing both movies, I was reminded that the love and enthusiasm of fans here rivals — or perhaps even surpasses — that of fans in Japan. From the happy faces of the fans after the screening, there is no doubt that this passion and love will continue to grow.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Bandai Namco Music Live Festival returned to Anime Friends 2025, held in São Paulo, Brazil from July 3 to 6. This marks the second consecutive year the festival has appeared at South America’s largest anime convention, which draws an annual attendance of around 150,000.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Bandai Namco Music Live manages labels including Lantis, SUNRISE Music, Kiramune, MoooD Records, and UNIERA, and is home to a diverse roster of artists. On the festival’s opening day, four acts took the stage: ASH DA HERO, STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION, Nowlu, and MindaRyn.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;TUfave is excited to announce its new collaboration jewelry collection with the TV anime “Attack on Titan”. These necklaces (5 designs total) delicately capture the attractiveness of the characters and the series&apos; world, inspired by iconic scenes. Each piece features a simple design centered around a large natural stone, creating &quot;collaboration jewelry for adults&quot; that subtly blends into daily life.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Nowlu Kicks Off the Show with Her Anisong Debut&lt;/h2&gt;
        Nowlu opened the festival with a confident performance that defied the fact it was her first-ever live show. She began with “Arika” (GUILTY GEAR STRIVE: DUAL RULERS) and “yoin” (Wingman).
        
        “I’m so happy to have my first live show here in São Paulo,” she said with a smile, drawing warm cheers. She followed with “Stuck on you” (More Than a Married Couple, But Not Lovers), creating a calm, intimate moment that brought the crowd together. Her debut ended to enthusiastic applause.
        
        Next up was a DJ set by ASH DA HERO member DJ Dhalsim. The crowd couldn’t help but dance as he spun one anisong hit after another: “Ai♡Scream!”, “Bokura wa Ima no Naka de” (Love Live!), “Shika-iro Days” (My Deer Friend Nokotan), and “Hare Hare Yukai” (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya). The energy of anisong swept through São Paulo, connecting fans across generations.	
        
        &lt;h2&gt;“Brazil, I’m back!” MindaRyn Returns with a Smile&lt;/h2&gt;
        MindaRyn took the stage next, returning for a second year in a row. “Brazil, I’m back!” she called out with a big smile before launching into a set of three powerful yet gentle songs: “Daylight” (Arifureta: From Commonplace to World’s Strongest Season 2), “Shiny Girl” (SHY), and “Fireworks” (Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke’s Mansion).

        During her MC segment, she asked, “Was anyone here last year? Thanks to those seeing me for the first time, too!” connecting warmly with the audience. As part of her world tour Hello New Friends, which began in June 2025, she performs special covers of songs from her label, Lantis. For Brazil, she sang “Rhapsody of Blue Sky” (Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, originally by fhána) and “Sparkling Daydream” (Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions, originally by ZAQ).
        
        She followed with a high-energy rock trio: “HIBANA” (Sengoku Youko: The Reformer Siblings Arc), “SURVIVE” (Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke’s Mansion), and her breakout hit “Like Flames” (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Season 2), which has surpassed 22 million views on YouTube. Her explosive performance had the entire venue fired up.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION: Sound and Vision in Perfect Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
        STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION (R・O・N) made his Brazilian debut with a 17-song medley set to anime visuals. Highlights included “ALPHA” (Moriarty the Patriot), “Renegade” (GANGSTA), and the fan-favorite “STORYSEEKER” (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Season 2), which has surpassed 10 million views on YouTube.

        After a brief pause, the word “Ultraman” appeared on the screen, instantly stirring the crowd. MindaRyn returned to perform “BLACK STAR” (Ultraman Blazer), followed by an appearance from Ultraman Blazer himself, drawing cheers and excitement.

        &lt;h2&gt;ASH DA HERO Brings the Festival to a Climactic Close&lt;/h2&gt;	
        ASH DA HERO took the stage for the grand finale, joined by Dhalsim (DJ), Sato (bass), and WANI (drums). Kicking off with “Super Sonic,” they followed with “YELLOW FEVER DANCE” and “Hankou Seimei” as the crowd pumped their fists and sang along.
        
        They kept the energy high with “LA VIDA LOCA,” already a live anthem despite being a recent release, then surprised the audience with “Octave” and “Beast Mode,” insert songs from Blue Lock: Episode Nagi, accompanied by anime footage. After introducing the members, they launched into “Judgement,” the opening theme for the anime’s second cour. The crowd erupted, singing along as ASH stepped off the stage shouting, “Sing it, Brazil!”

        For the final act, all performers returned to the stage at ASH’s invitation for the first-ever band performance of “Trinity” (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: The Saga of How the Demon Lord and Dragon Founded a Nation). ASH took on Takuma Terashima’s part in this rare collaboration, thrilling fans. The concert closed with a group photo and a wave of thunderous applause.

        The anisong wave that swept Brazil in 2024 has firmly taken root—and is still growing!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Next Stop: Southeast Asia!&lt;/h2&gt;
        
        The Bandai Namco Music Live Festival isn’t just heating up Brazil; it’s heading to Southeast Asia next. The festival will appear at COS-MIC 2025 in Malaysia on September 13, and AniEx 2025 in Bangkok, Thailand on November 22.
        
        The anisong excitement born in São Paulo is spreading across borders, forging new connections through music. The journey of the Bandai Namco Music Live Festival is only just beginning.

        This piece is inspired by the scene where Hange, who has experienced the loss of many dear ones, offers quiet support to Mikasa in her grief. At its center is a smoky quartz, a stone known for symbolizing “responsibility” and “comfort,” with a color that evokes Hange’s hair. Above it sits a cubic zirconia representing the color of Hange’s eyes. The sharp silhouette and combination of stone colors express Hange’s intelligence and individuality.

        As part of the BEYBLADE X World Championship, the company behind BEYBLADE held the U.S. National qualifier at Anime Expo 2025 in the Los Angeles Convention Center. Honey’s Anime had the opportunity to interview Masahiko Yamazaki (Head of Global Beyblade Business), Hisato Takaoka (General Manager of Beyblade), and Makoto Muraki (Specialist on the Beyblade Design Team). Let’s see what they had to say about BEYBLADE X’s first tournament appearance at AX!

        Why did you choose Anime Expo as the venue for the U.S. National qualifier? What goes into organizing an event of this scale here?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        BEYBLADE launched in Japan in 1999, and in the U.S. in 2000. That means it has been 25 years since BEYBLADE first arrived in America. Last year was our first time bringing BEYBLADE to Anime Expo and we were very, very surprised and excited to find so many adult fans here. We have always believed the potential of American fans and community, and seeing their passion firsthand was a very great opportunity for us. That’s why we wanted to return and hold the tournament at this year&apos;s event.
        
        BEYBLADE started just as a toy, but we’ve been aiming towards making it an entertainment sport, that’s why we thought about Los Angeles, the city of entertainment. Anime Expo is a very, very huge event so, in line with our branch’s story, this is a very suitable opportunity and a suitable event at AX. If you had the chance to come here during the morning (Saturday, July 5, 2025) there were so many people in line, we were not expecting so many fans to show up! Last year, BEYBLADE was here, but this year is the first time that we’ve held a tournament. We could not have imagined the number of people who attended. We were pleasantly surprised and very impressed with the number of attendees.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        What are you hoping that fans take away from this event, or what were you expecting to show fans by holding this tournament here at AX?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!--Sōhei Matsuura hex--&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex-rotate&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex-bg&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&apos;https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Yamazaki.jpg&apos;)&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        From what I’ve seen, there’s a great opportunity to further grow and support adult tournaments in the U.S. I want to give hope that in the future, we will have more and more events for the American fans. While at the booth, I wondered why 200, or 300 people had gathered here, staying all the time around the stage area; it got me thinking that maybe this is a very, very rare opportunity to witness an official BEYBLADE tournament.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!--Sōhei Matsuura hex--&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex-rotate&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex-bg&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&apos;https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Takaoka.jpg&apos;)&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        I wanted fans to take away the experience of an official tournament. I hope that those people who participated in the Anime Expo Tournament, go back to their hometowns and do the same as they did here. We formally introduced how to participate in a BEYBLADE tournament, showed them not only the format, but the experience, and how it goes after you lose or win a match, where you shake hands, etc. That’s the experience I hope they take from this event. 
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        After seeing the popularity of the BEYBLADE X tournament in Anime Expo, are you planning on coming back to AX next year or maybe plan on holding other official tournaments in other conventions across the U.S.?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        Yes, as BEYBLADE X we plan to come to Anime Expo next year. We hope to expand with other tournaments or activities, as well as participate in other major U.S. conventions, working together with Hasbro, our U.S. partner.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        With BEYBLADE X growing in popularity, what’s your vision for the expansion of the franchise in the next decade?  Do you see it expanding into things like virtual or augmented reality battles, or is the focus more on growing physical product availability, especially here in the U.S.?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        Seeing that there are many new technologies like AI, AR, or VR as you mentioned, in the case of BEYBLADE it had a weird introduction into the metaverse world through Roblox. Right now, nearly 40 million visitors from around the world have joined the BEYBLADE world on Roblox. I can see that technology is important, but from what I can see the most important thing is the community. BEYBLADE fans are encouraged to enjoy the brand in many ways, so it has great potential to cultivate a community no matter what technology it expands to. But we’ve committed to grow the community rather than focusing on introducing the brand to new technology.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        In Japan, Roblox is not really popular yet, but in the U.S.A, as well as other parts of Asia it&apos;s really popular. BEYBLADEs’ strength is that they can provide a physical experience, at the same time, this is our weakness. We want fans to enjoy BEYBLADE globally, but as of right now, Roblox is the answer the fans have created. And the fantastic thing is that you can play it from anywhere.

        The players of that BEYBLADE world in Roblox, the total of Japanese players is maybe around 5% but the other 95% are from all over the world; number one is currently Thailand, followed by Mexico and the U.S.A. That&apos;s why we embraced Roblox, since it’s a global platform that surpasses the barriers and restrictions of our physical limitations.		
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        When designing parts for BEYBLADE X with competitive players in mind, how do you strike a balance between performance, durability, and customization? Is one prioritized more than the others, or is it always a compromise?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        Those three elements you mentioned are very, very important. First of all, BEYBLADE X is a product that can be enjoyed by children and adults, so our priority is safety. At the same time, it has to be truly thrilling and fun to play. Although it seems at odds with safety the features that make the game exciting—like high-speed, intense collisions are essential for our products so it is a big challenge for us to pursue both aspects. We try not to have tradeoffs or compromises, they try to deliver all those points at the highest possible “level”, This is something we really take care of when thinking about new model designs.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        As a competitive game, BEYBLADE must often introduce different &quot;battle strategies&quot;. I see BEYBLADE X has a gimmick called &quot;X-dash&quot; Could you walk me through how you come up with these strategies?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        BEYBLADE X physical contact is really important. “Physical contact” is the base keyword in the company, so everyone keeps it in mind when creating the product. If it goes faster, would it be interesting? If it falls apart, will it be interesting? Those kinds of unique ideas are always brought forward by the team and we bring it to life as a demo product by the design team to test it out. After everyone has experienced it and it makes sense as a strategy, then the idea will move on to the next level until it makes it to the actual product. One thing we’re always taking care of is that we don’t create only an idea, but also create a demo product to test it out within the team.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        As for battle gimmicks like the X-Dash, so far what has been the most challenging or interesting gimmick that you have created?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        3rd generation BEYBLADE Burst. This was the first time that the toy would be torn apart, breaking into pieces. That gimmick introduced in the 3rd generation was challenging because the point was for them to break apart on purpose, but also you should be able to put it back together. On top of that, we had to achieve for it to spin super fast and all the pieces would fly out all over the place, so safety was a challenge. Before this model, the arena did not have the guard piece, so we had to come up with the arena barrier too. 
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;

        Now that you have seen the popularity of BEYBLADE X in Anime Expo, and of course, Anime Expo caters to an Otaku culture, do you have in mind any collaboration with some big anime title? For example, a series of toys inspired by big IPs?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        In Japan, we’ve had experience collaborating with celebrities and sports groups. We won’t deny any future collaborations with any anime IP. We have already  collaborated with major IPs like Star Wars and Marvel featuring characters like Skywalker or Spiderman, we even have a collaboration with FC Barcelona, a legendary European multi-sports club based in Catalonia.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        I want to ask you all for your personal experience watching the popularity of the BEYBLADE X booth and seeing all the fans there as well as the competitive U.S. Bey community playing in the tournament. Has anything surprised you? Has the U.S. player base inspired you in any way? How’s the US community different from the Japanese community? Any personal feelings that you’d like to share about your experience at Anime Expo and the BEYBLADE Championship? 
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        As I expected, United States fans are really full of emotion. Most of the American　fans are shouting “Woo, I did it! I did it!”. I like this style of celebrating, it&apos;s something I am really glad to see, hahaha.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        During BEYBLADE’s panel event at AX, we played the first episode of our new anime season. The fans there were very very excited and had a good reaction. But we not only talked about the animation, we also talked about BEYBLADE as a product and the community was very curious about how we design our toys, about the making process. It gave me the impression that the U.S. fans are extremely curious about BEYBLADE, so I enjoyed their reaction to our panel.  
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        When I saw the participants of the tournaments and noticed the kind of Beys that they use I thought their selections were interesting. Usually, when you compete in tournaments, the ultimate goal should be to win, right? But seeing the U.S. participants, they are using the BEYBLADEs that they really like, ones that they have emotional attachments to. The ratio is a lot higher in the U.S. than in Japan. The way that fans enjoy BEYBLADE X here in the U.S. is wider, so that’s the point of view I gained from this experience and I will take it into consideration for future product design.  
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt80&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;  
        The passion and enthusiasm surrounding BEYBLADE X at Anime Expo 2025 was undeniable. It&apos;s clear that BEYBLADE continues to evolve as more than just a toy, it’s a global phenomenon fueled by community, creativity, and competition. With plans to return and expand further into U.S. events, the future of BEYBLADE is spinning faster than ever!

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;NOVA is a new four-member VTuber group from the popular US-based agency VShojo. They made a surprise debut announcement and held their first event at Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, one of the world’s largest anime conventions with around 400,000 attendees annually.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Kicking off with the surprise announcement at Anime Expo 2025, NOVA officially launched their music career under a new label, UNIVOLT, created in collaboration with Universal Music.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;NOVA is VShojo’s first Japanese-speaking VTuber group, consisting of Akatsuki Hotaru, Hestia Happiness, Okamoto Nagi, and Yutori Peke. They made their livestream debut in November 2024, drawing attention as part of VShojo’s full-scale entry into the Japanese market. Set in a fantasy world where they travel through a post-apocalyptic parallel universe, each of the group’s four unique characters has their own background and profession. They primarily stream in Japanese on YouTube and Twitch.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Their debut track, “Starry Connection,” was released today at 13:00 (JST), alongside its official music video. It features a Japanese hyper pop sound that highlights the unique personalities of all four members. The lyrics were written by utumiyqcom, who appeared on Rap Star, and the music was composed by up-and-coming Vocaloid producer Tokyo Manaka. The song is packed with NOVA’s signature flair, even incorporating the members’ names into the lyrics. The music video, produced by Toei Zukun Laboratory, vividly brings NOVA’s fantasy world to life.

        &lt;p&gt;
        Most of you probably weren’t even born back then, but some of us still remember what football games were like before they turned into lootbox fests catering only to online competitors. Back in the day, there were tons of different titles and approaches to the sport, and most of them had their own unique charm, offering countless hours of fun with friends and siblings.
        
        Among the standouts, the Goal! franchise was probably our favorite… and now it’s back in full glory, with both classic games bundled into one awesome package!
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-unit&quot; id=&quot;scroll-short-length-unit1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;
        Football Unites the World
        &lt;/h1&gt;		
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-paragraph mt30&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Yes, that’s actually one of FIFA’s recent slogans (the organization, not the video game series), and it perfectly captures one of the highlights of this new bundle.
        
        Originally developed by Tose and published by Jaleco (both Japanese companies) Goal! (known in Japan as Moero!! Pro Soccer) debuted in 1988. It was later localized for North America and Europe, with slightly different versions released in each region. Thanks to its popularity, a sequel followed in 1992, launching globally. But things weren’t as straightforward as they might seem…

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- /IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE --&gt;			
        
        Because the games were released in different regions and on different consoles, there are a number of notable differences—not just in the titles, but in the content itself. For instance, the lineup of national teams varies by version. In the Japanese release of Goal!, Uruguay and the USA are not included; instead, players get Northern Ireland and Scotland. Goal! Two features even more regional variation: the Japanese version includes teams like Colombia, Ghana, and Austria, while the Western release swaps them out for Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela. Meanwhile, the USSR and West Germany are present in the NES version but were omitted from the SNES port.
        
        Fortunately, this new bundle includes all versions of both games, giving players access to every regional team, no matter where they were originally released.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /.wrap-unit --&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;inline-block&quot;&gt;

        &lt;!-- /IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE --&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-paragraph mt30&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Another feature we absolutely loved is the inclusion of all the original cover art and instruction manuals. Back in the &apos;80s and &apos;90s, reading and re-reading those little booklets, or proudly displaying them on your shelf, was a big part of the whole video game experience.
        
        Sure, these games aren’t exactly complex in terms of controls or mechanics—after all, most systems back then only had a couple of buttons to work with. In fact, most of the instructions now feel like plain common sense to today’s players. Still, having access to the original manuals feels oddly refreshing. And best of all, you can switch languages with a single button press.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /.wrap-unit --&gt;
        
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-unit&quot; id=&quot;scroll-short-length-unit3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;
        And What About the Gameplay?
        &lt;/h1&gt;
        
        &lt;!-- IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE --&gt;
        &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;inline-block&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;img-shadow&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jaleco_goal1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-height-500 wp-image-312937&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        [sourceLink asin=&quot;&quot; asin_jp=&quot;&quot; cdj_product_id=&quot;&quot; text=&quot;&quot; url=&quot;&quot; ]
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- /IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE --&gt;	
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-paragraph mt30&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        The most notable addition to this bundle is the ability to rewind time at any moment (like in some racing games), whether it’s to stop a goal from being scored, avoid a yellow or red card, or simply get a second chance after completely shanking a shot into the stratosphere.
        
        Was it necessary? Probably not. Does it feel like cheating? Absolutely, and football purists will no doubt see it as a disgrace to the sport. But hey, it’s 100% optional, so no harm done… right? If anything, it’s just a modern safety net for retro frustration. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;!-- IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE --&gt;
        &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;inline-block&quot;&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;wrap-paragraph mt30&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        No one expects games from four decades ago to stand toe-to-toe with modern sensations like EA FC, PES, or even Rematch. But firing up a few Goal! or Goal! Two matches with friends, whether out of nostalgia or curiosity, depending on your age, can still be a blast.
        
        Sure, we don’t see ourselves playing these games non-stop for days, but we genuinely enjoyed re-adapting to the punishing controls and arcade-style gameplay. Plus, there&apos;s something charming about scoring goals with national teams from countries that you don’t typically find in other football games, or that don’t even exist anymore. Nevertheless, if you like competing online, you can compete against other players on the monthly leaderboards! 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;	
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /.wrap-unit --&gt;

        Final Thoughts

        &lt;p class=&quot;mt30&quot;&gt;
        Jaleco Sports: Goal!, the remake developed by Sickhead Games and Rock It Games, is one of those bundles we’re just happy to have in our library, ready to launch now and then for a few laughs and a trip down memory lane.
        
        The game is available for Windows PC via Steam and GOG. It&apos;s been announced there will be a PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch release later this year.

        &lt;li&gt;AVIOT, operated by Preseed Japan Corporation, which manufactures and sells consumer electronics, will open pre-orders for the TE-V1R-HE2 true wireless earbuds on July 2.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Based on the TE-V1R from AVIOT’s hit V Series, which has sold approximately 190,000 units to date*, the TE-V1R-HE2 is a special edition inspired by the VTuber group hololive English -Advent-, made up of Shiori Novella, Koseki Bijou, Nerissa Ravencroft, Fuwawa Abyssgard, and Mococo Abyssgard.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Each member has their own voice mode, along with special small group modes for Shiori Novella, Koseki Bijou, and Nerissa Ravencroft, as well as FUWAMOCO (Fuwawa &amp; Mococo Abyssgard). All modes are available in both English and Japanese, for a total of over 370 newly recorded lines across 14 unique modes!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The earbuds and charging case showcase exclusive designs inspired by hololive English -Advent-, and the packaging includes a newly illustrated group visual created just for this collaboration. Package design and artwork will be revealed at a later date.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;To celebrate the launch, AVIOT is holding a campaign where five fans will win a replica autograph board featuring the new illustrations. Full details are available on AVIOT’s official X account.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;From July 3, a hololive English -Advent- photo corner will also appear at the AVIOT booth at Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, one of the largest anime conventions in North America.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Product Characteristics&lt;/h2&gt;

        The TE-V1R is the latest model in AVIOT’s popular V series, which has sold approximately 190,000 units*. The earbuds offer an ultra-long battery life of 19 hours (62 hours with the charging case) and Adaptive Hybrid Noise Canceling, which automatically adjusts the noise reduction strength based on the surrounding environment. They also feature the new Hybrid Dual Driver 2.0 for enhanced sound quality, LDAC™ support for high-resolution playback, and wireless charging functionality, making them a high-grade model that perfectly balances sound quality and functionality.
        
        *As of the end of April 2025
        
        &lt;b&gt;Special Voice Lines&lt;/b&gt;
        In addition to standard voice guidance for notifications like power and connection status, these earbuds include a “random voice” feature that plays special lines, including some that fans may recognize from the members’ streams. Altogether, there are over 370 newly recorded voice lines.

        &lt;b&gt;Special Design&lt;/b&gt;
        The earbuds and charging case feature a unique design created exclusively for this collaboration. Inspired by the abyss of the great prison known as “The Cell,” the base color is a deep black, accented with metallic ice silver elements that reflect the Advent logo. The result is a chic, sophisticated look that brings the distinctive charm of each member right to your fingertips.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Azuki™, COMISMA Inc., and Xenotoon Inc. announced a new joint anime studio “Studio Azuki”  based in the United States. The studio will develop, produce, and globally distribute original IPs and anime adaptations through unique production models shaped by the creative DNA of Azuki and its partners.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Originally launched as an NFT project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azuki.com/about&quot;&gt;Azuki&lt;/a&gt; has been at the forefront in blending anime production with technologies and social media, while fostering collaboration between global creators and Japanese anime talents. By forming a joint venture with COMISMA and Xenotoon—both of which bring strong anime production expertise—Studio Azuki aims to strengthen its creative capacity and position itself as a next-generation global anime studio.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Azuki has been at the forefront of the rapidly growing global anime fandom, particularly in the U.S., where enthusiasm spans general audiences, Hollywood creators, celebrities, and businesses. Studio Azuki fuses this international momentum with Japan’s anime culture to pioneer new production models, elevate storytelling quality, enable fan collaboration, and introduce social-first formats that define the future of global anime.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Guided by its “Anime 2.0” vision, Azuki has launched several key initiatives, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anime.com/shows/azuki&quot;&gt;Enter The Garden&lt;/a&gt; anthology series, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anime.com/&quot;&gt;Anime.com&lt;/a&gt;, and being an early contributor to Animecoin Foundation. Studio Azuki will continue to explore how these platforms and blockchain technology can reshape the way anime is financed, produced, and experienced.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;COMISMA, a founding partner of the new studio, is known for operating the manga app GANMA! and cultivating original works. It also owns the high-end animation studio Qzil.la. Xenotoon, meanwhile, brings a robust 2D/3D production pipeline and a creator-first studio network, exemplified by its collaborations with indie animators such as those behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@gensho_yasuda&quot;&gt;Yasuda Gensho&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“With a global-first, creator-centric, and social-native approach, Studio Azuki is our bold step toward building the next generation of anime, one that empowers creators, &amp; connects directly with fans,” said Feb Tea, Head of Content at Azuki Labs. “By joining forces with COMISMA and Xenotoon, we’re combining deep, authentic anime production expertise with fresh creative energy and global perspective. Together, we can redefine how anime is developed, financed, and experienced around the world, with new original anime titles, stories and creators for years to come.”&lt;/li&gt;
        
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Koki Sato, CEO of COMISMA Inc.&lt;/h2&gt;
        I’m truly excited to be part of the launch of Studio Azuki. At COMISMA, we have long been guided by our mission to make &apos;manga artist&apos; a dream profession for children. Through trust in creators and strong engagement with fans, we have delivered many successful IPs to the world. With our anime studio Qzil.la focused on high-end anime, we aim to create globally beloved anime titles. I look forward to driving the industry&apos;s growth through Studio Azuki.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Koichi Kawase, CEO of Xenotoon Inc.&lt;/h2&gt;
        We are thrilled to announce the formation of Studio Azuki alongside such strong partners as Azuki and COMISMA. Our studio has experience across everything from social media-first short-form anime to feature-length theatrical works. From the beginning, our three companies shared a strong vision for the future of anime and entertainment. I believe it was inevitable that we would create a groundbreaking global studio together. This also marks a turning point in realizing our long-held vision to democratize the anime production, funding, and distribution pipeline. We look forward to creating a new chapter in anime history and co-creating titles that will captivate the world.	
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Ko Yada, CEO of Westbrook Inc.&lt;/h2&gt;
        At Westbrook, our mission has always been to tell stories that connect, inspire, and transcend borders. Partnering with Studio Azuki is a powerful step in that direction. Their creative vision and cultural insight align seamlessly with our global strategy. Together, we’re excited to identify and develop projects that resonate deeply with audiences around the world, blending authentic storytelling with boundary-pushing innovation.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Strategic Partnership with Westbrook Inc.&lt;/h2&gt;
        In conjunction with the studio’s formation, Studio Azuki has entered into a strategic partnership with Westbrook Inc., the global media company founded by Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith, Miguel Melendez, and Ko Yada, focused on empowering artists to tell stories that connect the world.. By combining Studio Azuki’s production capabilities with Westbrook’s deep Hollywood network and expertise in global entertainment, the partnership aims to bring next-generation anime content to audiences worldwide.

        &lt;h2&gt;AXGRIT Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
        Transcending nationalities and generations, SHIBUYA TSUTAYA—a cultural hub constantly evolving through content and events that captivate people from all walks of life—has teamed up with Design Coco, a company deeply involved in the creation of figures and a wide range of craftsmanship. Together, they aim to create a brand that is the convergence point of all content, turning Shibuya into a global mecca for cutting-edge anime and gaming culture.
        
        The brand AXGRIT is an original universe themed around flying and fighting in a post-apocalyptic world using anti-gravity units. Focusing on figurines, their various products, and exhibitions based on this concept will be showcased primarily at SHIBUYA TSUTAYA.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;AXGRIT Worldview&lt;/h2&gt;
        The convergence point of all dimensions. Take back your freedom with wings of anti-gravity, and seize hope.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;AXGRIT Lore&lt;/h2&gt;
        The convergence point of all dimensions. Take back your freedom with wings of anti-gravity, and seize hope.
        
        In a near-future Earth where science has advanced and civilization has flourished, humanity developed a device called the Cross Dimension, enabling access to the Multiverse.
        
        This breakthrough allowed humans to make contact with beings from alternate worlds, regardless of whether they were two-dimensional or three-dimensional.
        
        The barriers between dimensions had fallen, and the world cultivated even greater wisdom and wealth.
        
        However, one day, a catastrophic system failure known as the Dimension Accident occurred, causing countless worlds influenced by the Cross Dimension to merge into a single, unified realm.
        
        Although this unprecedented convergence plunged every world into chaos, order was gradually restored under the guidance of the United Earth Forces’ organization, the United Birth.
        
        Yet, numerous problems remained.
        
        The merging of worlds brought about unknown disasters and mysterious enemies immune to conventional weapons.
        To make matters worse, a faction known as Nemesis Gravitas (hereafter referred to as Nemesis) began exploiting the Gravity Core, the energy source of the Cross Dimension, in an attempt to dominate the residents of each world.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Design COCO Co., Ltd. announced the launch of a new line of figurines featuring Fuwawa Abyssgard and Mococo Abyssgard from hololive English -Advent- redesigned in exclusive &quot;AXGRIT&quot; costumes. They have been available for pre-order since April 25th, 2025, through our official online store, COCO Store (https://coco-store.jp/), with orders closing on August 28th, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;These figurines mark the debut of AXGRIT, a collaborative brand born from SHIBUYA TSUTAYA IP Bookstore and Design COCO, celebrating the first anniversary of SHIBUYA TSUTAYA’s renewal opening.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Set in a dystopian future where characters equipped with anti-gravity units “fly” and “fight,” AXGRIT offers a unique and original worldview and product line.
        The figurines feature fine detailing, including anti-gravity units attached to their elegantly posed legs, semi-transparent custom jackets unique to AXGRIT, and optional paw-like accessories with movable claws and plush paw pads—adding depth to their dynamic poses.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Both figurines will be showcased at Anime Expo 2025 this summer—don’t miss your chance to witness AXGRIT’s first step into the world!&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;AXGRIT Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
        Transcending nationalities and generations, SHIBUYA TSUTAYA—a cultural hub constantly evolving through content and events that captivate people from all walks of life—has teamed up with Design Coco, a company deeply involved in the creation of figures and a wide range of craftsmanship. Together, they aim to create a brand that is the convergence point of all content, turning Shibuya into a global mecca for cutting-edge anime and gaming culture.
        
        The brand AXGRIT is an original universe themed around flying and fighting in a post-apocalyptic world using anti-gravity units. Focusing on figurines, their various products, and exhibitions based on this concept will be showcased primarily at SHIBUYA TSUTAYA.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;AXGRIT Worldview&lt;/h2&gt;
        The convergence point of all dimensions. Take back your freedom with wings of anti-gravity, and seize hope.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;AXGRIT Lore&lt;/h2&gt;
        The convergence point of all dimensions. Take back your freedom with wings of anti-gravity, and seize hope.
        
        In a near-future Earth where science has advanced and civilization has flourished, humanity developed a device called the Cross Dimension, enabling access to the Multiverse.
        
        This breakthrough allowed humans to make contact with beings from alternate worlds, regardless of whether they were two-dimensional or three-dimensional.
        
        The barriers between dimensions had fallen, and the world cultivated even greater wisdom and wealth.
        
        However, one day, a catastrophic system failure known as the Dimension Accident occurred, causing countless worlds influenced by the Cross Dimension to merge into a single, unified realm.
        
        Although this unprecedented convergence plunged every world into chaos, order was gradually restored under the guidance of the United Earth Forces’ organization, the United Birth.
        
        Yet, numerous problems remained.
        
        The merging of worlds brought about unknown disasters and mysterious enemies immune to conventional weapons.
        To make matters worse, a faction known as Nemesis Gravitas (hereafter referred to as Nemesis) began exploiting the Gravity Core, the energy source of the Cross Dimension, in an attempt to dominate the residents of each world.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Bandai Namco Music Live Inc. will begin accepting entries for the third round of its anime song choir project ChoieL on July 1, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;ChoieL is an ongoing online choir competition that was launched in August 2022, with a second round in March 2024. Round 3 brings back the 22 songs from previous editions and adds new selections from Bandai Namco Music Live’s SUNRISE MUSIC label, for a total of 28 eligible songs. As before, the contest features two categories: Full and Short.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Returning to the judging panel are Sohei Miyoshi (Choral Conductor / Secretary General of the Tokyo Choral Association / Planning and Supervision) and composer Tatsuya Tanaka, both of whom have served as judges since the first round.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Joining this round as official ambassadors is ARCANA PROJECT, an artist group from Bandai Namco Music Live’s Lantis label. A promotional video featuring the group is now available. ARCANA PROJECT will also serve as guest judges and present a new “ARCANA PROJECT Award.”&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Entries will be accepted from July 1 to August 31, 2025, with both the Full and Short categories held concurrently. We look forward to your enthusiastic participation!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Participating Judges&lt;/h2&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Sohei Miyoshi (Choral Conductor / Secretary General of the Tokyo Choral Association / Planning and Supervision)&lt;/h3&gt;
        It’s been three years since ChoieL began, and thanks to your support, we’re now entering our third round. The six new songs for Round 3 include titles that will resonate with an even wider range of generations than the original 22. With the addition of new arrangers, we believe this round offers more than ever for both anime song fans and choral music lovers alike. We hope ChoieL continues to be a place where you can express your passion to the fullest.
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Tatsuya Tanaka (Composer)&lt;/h3&gt;
        The ChoieL online choir competition is now entering its third round. The full lineup of 28 songs, including the six new additions, offers an exciting and enjoyable blend of anime songs and choral music in terms of song selection, arrangement, and composition. The past two competitions were full of unforgettable moments, and we’re already looking forward to seeing how participants will express themselves this time. If you have a passion for anime songs and choral music, that’s all you need to get started. We can’t wait to see your entry!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Official ChoieL Ambassadors &amp; Judges&lt;/h2&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;ARCANA PROJECT (Lantis/Artist)&lt;/h3&gt;	
        A vocal unit consisting of Usa Sakurano, Hana Hanamiya, Shion Aida, Hikaru Amano, Yuka Shidomi, and Sakura Yoshino, co-produced by DEARSTAGE and Lantis. With a tarot card-themed group motif, they bring a diverse range of songs, including anime theme songs, to life through their distinctive vocals and performances.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Comment:&lt;/b&gt;
        We’re ARCANA PROJECT, and we’re honored to take part in the ChoieL anime song choir project as both official ambassadors and judges. As a group brought together by our love of anime and singing, we’re truly excited to be involved in such a wonderful initiative. 
        
        Through our work as ARCANA PROJECT, we’ve come to feel that what matters most isn’t technical skill, but the joy of singing while making eye contact, the comfort of shared breath, and the freedom to express music from the heart. Discovering your own voice and connecting with others through song are deeply meaningful and precious experiences. 
        
        We hope this project brings those same experiences to many people. We can’t wait to hear your voices.

        &lt;h2&gt;About ChoieL&lt;/h2&gt;
        The anime song choir project “ChoieL” was launched on June 1, 2022, with the aim of bringing together the beloved tradition of choir and the world of anime songs. Our goal is to draw out new charms from each, aspiring to a future where anime songs are loved as standard numbers in the choir world. As the first step of this project, we hosted our first online choir competition in August 2022, and 50 groups participated to showcase the fresh appeal of anime songs.
        
        Starting from the second online competition, the project has expanded to include sustainable activities that utilize the intellectual property of anime songs to deliver free music events to young people and fans worldwide.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;KADOKAWA CORPORATION will co-host the novel contest, &quot;MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 - THE ISEKAI presented by KADOKAWA,&quot; in partnership with qdopp Inc. and MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. The contest will be held on Honeyfeed, a novel submission platform operated by qdopp, with the goal of discovering exceptional storytelling talent from around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;This contest aims to discover fresh talent who can craft stories with the potential to stand alongside industry-defining titles like Overlord, Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-, The Rising of the Shield Hero, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation and Sword Art Online. As an added bonus, the  contest features a special guest in the jury panel: Aneko Yusagi, writer of The Rising of the Shield Hero. Winners even receive personalized feedback from this renowned and experienced Isekai author, an incredible chance to gain insight directly from one of the most successful storytellers in the genre.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From Satoshi Arima, Project Manager and Editor in Chief of MF BOOKS&lt;/h2&gt;
        In recent years, Japanese anime has seen a surge in global popularity. Many of these popular anime titles originate from light novels. At KADOKAWA, we are constantly seeking new talent to create the next big hit. Amid this trend, an increasing number of stories styled after Japanese light novels are being posted on overseas novel submission platforms. These platforms are emerging as hubs for content and creators with the potential to achieve widespread success not only in Japan but around the world.
        
        In response to this global trend, KADOKAWA has launched the Global UGC Publishing Project as part of its Global Business Acceleration Program, which supports new business ventures targeting international markets. This project aims to discover global talent through overseas novel platforms and bring “internationally-born” light novels to audiences both in Japan and worldwide.
        
        The MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 – THE ISEKAI presented by KADOKAWA marks the first step in this initiative. Moving forward, the project will expand through initiatives such as a Traditional Chinese writing contest hosted on KadoKado - the novel serialization platform operated by KADOKAWA TAIWAN CORPORATION - as well as the publication of selected winning titles from the JNC Original Light Novel Contest organized by M12 Media LLC.

        &lt;li&gt;ARCANA PROJECT, known for performing theme songs for popular titles such as The Aquatope on White Sand and Ultraman Arc, released their new digital single “Kimi no Ichioshi Arimasu ka? / Ruby Ruby” on June 23.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;These two tracks serve as the second set of image songs for LINK TRAVELERS, Bandai’s new IP that launched through “shokugan” (candy) and “gashapon” (capsule toys) in May 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“Kimi no Ichioshi Arimasu ka?” is a classic idol anthem in the current trend, perfect for energizing a live crowd. In contrast, “Ruby Ruby” offers a nostalgic idol vibe with a fresh, uplifting melody. Both songs have been released in two editions: a Short Size used within the LINK TRAVELERS project, and a Full Size performed by all six members.

        &lt;h2&gt;LINK TRAVELERS Product Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
        Bandai’s new IP LINK TRAVELERS is built around two main distribution channels: “SIDE:C (CANDY = Shokugan)” and “SIDE:G (GASHAPON = Capsule Toys).” Following the major success of the original capsule toy figure series “Gashapon Quest,” LINK TRAVELERS was announced in November 2024 as its spiritual successor. This new series shifts the stage to both shokugan and gashapon markets for a fresh rollout. 
        
        Anticipation was high from the start of online pre-orders, and the product officially launched in May 2025. Featuring highly detailed figures and a wide variety of interchangeable parts, the line gives users the freedom to play and customize according to their preferences. Its richly developed story and setting further deepen the imaginative experience.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Voice actor and artist Takuma Terashima will release his 12th single “more than W” on August 27, 2025. The title track will serve as the ending theme for the TV anime Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra: World Conquest Starts with the Civilization of Ruin, which begins airing in July. The jacket art and a new artist photo have been revealed.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;This single features a special collaboration with TAKE from FLOW, who has frequently performed alongside Terashima at events. TAKE handled the music and composition, while Terashima contributed the lyrics himself. The result is a dark, passionate rock track inspired by the elf sisters from the anime.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The limited edition comes in a deluxe EP-sized paper jacket. The letter “W” (symbolizing world, word, and twins) is a key motif, and the cover features a slightly eerie, almost optical illusion-like design. The regular edition’s jacket uses an original illustration from the anime, depicting the elf sisters who inspired the track, along with Isla, who watches over them.
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;SERRA, known for her emotionally resonant voice that has earned her the title “Diva of Emotions,” will release her highly anticipated first album Dawn Light on August 27, 2025, under Bandai Namco Music Live’s label Lantis.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;SERRA made her major debut with the digital-only single “EYERIS” on November 25, 2022. In April 2023, she performed her first anime tie-in with “Always and Forever,” the ending theme for the TV anime Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke’s Mansion. She wrote both the lyrics and music herself, earning high praise from fellow creators not only for her vocals but also for her songwriting talent.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;On social media, she launched a viral campaign featuring a cappella videos filmed while holding a lantern. These videos quickly gained widespread attention, sparking a buzz among fans. In 2024, she expanded her activities by providing vocals and original songs for other artists as well.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Her long-awaited debut album Dawn Light features ten tracks, including two new songs, a remixed version of her major debut track “EYERIS,” the anime tie-in “Always and Forever,” and the fan-favorite “Blackout.” The album also offers fresh remixes and rearrangements of previous songs, offering listeners a fresh perspective on her work.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Reflecting the journey of the “Diva of Emotions,” who faced pain and doubt while holding onto hope, this album captures the fleeting moment of a new dawn, when faint light breaks through deep darkness.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;SERRA&apos;s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        Pain, loneliness, feelings of inferiority, and inner conflict—things I’ve carried alone in the middle of the night.
        Even in that darkness, I still wanted to believe in the light. My desire to live and keep singing is the light I’ve poured into my first album, Dawn Light. I hope this album offers comfort to your pain and gently illuminates the deepest parts of your heart. Above all, I wish for your night to come to an end and a new dawn to rise.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Singer/songwriter mekakushe’s song “Yuwanamerou,” which was used in Episode 10 of the TV anime series Kowloon Generic Romance, was released online on June 8.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Kowloon Generic Romance is a hugely popular mystery-romance anime based on Jun Mayuzuki (of After the Rain fame)’s latest work, which has sold more than 1.5 million copies.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Following the ending theme “Retronym of Love” and the Episode 7 insert song “Watashi Dake no Polaris,” this marks the third mekakushe track featured in the series.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“Yuwanamerou” was written and composed by mekakushe, with arrangement by Ryohei Sataka (Hifumi, inc.), who also handled the series’ score. The result is a wistful pop song that delicately expresses the complexity of a woman’s hidden emotions.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Mekakushe’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        To me, love is like the aurora—like a mirage, it shines beautifully because it’s born from loneliness. When I imagined the moment of meeting someone, it felt like a rush of heat sweeping through my heart, creating an aurora. It was something like a solar flare. That feeling is what inspired me as I wrote “Yuwanamerou.”
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Mekakushe’s Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
        Handling lyrics, composition, vocals, and piano performance by herself, the next-generation singer-songwriter Mekakushe enjoys immense popularity among artists and creators. Starting classical piano at the age of three, she gradually gravitated towards pop music. Her independently produced songs were featured in a Kao Laurier commercial, and she was one of the top artists on the Spotify official playlist “Kirakira Pop Japan” with a total of 3 million plays. She is a promising emerging artist with anticipated future success. With electronica as the foundation in her recordings, her musical style continues to expand, featuring classical solos and band sets in live performances.

        &lt;li&gt;AVIOT, operated by Preseed Japan Corporation, which manufactures and sells consumer electronics, is launching its 2025 Spring/Summer Promo Tour with appearances at anime conventions across the United States. At each event, AVIOT will showcase and sell character voice earbuds and collaboration merchandise.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About Character Voice Earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
        AVIOT’s character voice earbuds are special-edition models created in collaboration with anime, VTubers, and voice actors. Each pair features exclusive designs, packaging, and voice guidance recorded by the featured cast, providing voice prompts for functions like power and battery status.
        
        They also include a “Random Voice” feature, which lets you enjoy iconic lines or exclusive phrases only available through the earbuds. Simply touch and hold the right earbud to hear surprise voice clips at any time. Most models offer multiple voice modes, which can be easily switched via the companion app, allowing you to enjoy different characters or personalities with a single pair.
        
        Sound tuning is supervised by the original artists or voice actors to capture each title’s unique atmosphere. Select models also include specially drawn artwork*, designed with close attention to detail to reflect the world of your favorite character.
        
        *Sound tuning and special artwork may not be available for all models.
        
        In addition to fan-focused features, these earbuds also offer high-end specs such as noise cancellation and long battery life, making them a great choice for everyday use. Several collaboration models are based on the TE-V1R, a high-spec base model that has received multiple awards, including the PCMag Excellence Award.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;AVIOT, operated by Preseed Japan Corporation, which manufactures and sells consumer electronics, opened pre-orders for the TE-V1R-KZN true wireless earbuds, a collaboration model with KizunaAI, on April 28. Based on the TE-V1R, this special edition features design and sound tuning fully supervised by KizunaAI, packaging with brand-new visuals, and newly recorded voice lines in Japanese and English.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Based on the latest model in AVIOT’s hit V series, which has sold approximately 170,000 units*, the TE-V1R-KZN is a special edition packed with the unique charm of KizunaAI, who resumed activities in February.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;KizunaAI (“Kizuna” means “bond” or “connection” in Japanese) is a virtual being and artist who works under the theme, “I still want to connect with you and get to know you.” This collaboration model features earbuds with a design overseen by KizunaAI herself and sound tuning optimized to highlight the full appeal of her singing voice. The packaging showcases a brand-new visual by champi. In addition to newly recorded voice guidance for power and connection status, the earbuds include a “random voice” feature that allows you to listen to special voice lines anytime you like. With the ability to switch between Japanese and English voice modes, these earbuds are a perfect match for an AI who connects with people around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;KizunaAI introduced the product herself during a special listening party on April 29. Don’t miss it!&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Product Characteristics&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Base Model&lt;/b&gt;
        The TE-V1R is the latest model in AVIOT’s popular V series, which has sold approximately 170,000 units*. The earbuds offer an ultra-long battery life of 19 hours (62 hours with the charging case) and Adaptive Hybrid Noise Canceling, which automatically adjusts the noise reduction strength based on the surrounding environment. They also feature the new Hybrid Dual Driver 2.0 for enhanced sound quality, LDAC™ support for high-resolution playback, and wireless charging functionality, making them a high-grade model that perfectly balances sound quality and functionality.
        
        *As of the end of January 2025
        
        &lt;b&gt;Special Voice Lines&lt;/b&gt;
        The voice guidance for notifications such as power status has been newly recorded specifically for this model, with KizunaAI speaking to you as if she’s right there! It also features a “random voice” function that lets you hear lines from KizunaAI anytime you like. As is fitting of an AI who connects with people around the world, the earbuds come with both Japanese and English modes.

        &lt;b&gt;Special Design&lt;/b&gt;
        The off-white and soft pink color scheme captures KizunaAI’s signature style, giving the design a calm and refined feel. The charging case features a logo symbolizing her reactivation, while the earbuds themselves are adorned with her iconic emblem. The design was created to have a timeless appeal, making it easy to pair with any outfit or setting.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;It has been announced that WurtS will perform “Doukashiteru,” the brand-new ending theme for the second season of the TV anime DAN DA DAN!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;DAN DA DAN is a hit manga by Yukinobu Tatsu, currently serialized in Shueisha’s manga app Shonen Jump+ (updated every Tuesday), with over 10 million copies in circulation. The story follows Momo Ayase, a high school girl born into a family of spirit mediums, and her classmate Okarun Takakura, an occult fanatic, as they take on supernatural threats in this thrilling blend of occult battles and youthful adventure.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“Doukashiteru” is featured in the newly released Friendship &amp; Love trailer. The second season, following the first season that aired from October to December 2024, is set to begin soon.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Comment From WurtS&lt;/h2&gt;
        I’m WurtS, and I’m performing the ending theme for the DAN DA DAN anime. As a huge fan of both the manga and the anime, I’m truly honored to be part of this project. In this crazy world where various life forms suddenly appear, I wanted to capture the characters’ complicated feelings—awkward but full of longing. We’ve packed all that excitement and heart-throbbing emotion into this wonderful song. Thank you so much, and I hope you enjoy it.

        &lt;h2&gt;Voice Cast of Sanda’s Classmates Revealed!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Shiori Fuyumura (Voiced by Umeka Shoji)&lt;/h3&gt;
        A 14-year-old classmate of Sanda who stands over 182 cm tall. She seeks help from Santa Claus to find her friend Ono, who suddenly went missing. To break the curse and revive the sealed Santa, she threatens Sanda with a deadly blade.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt;
        1. How did you feel when you were cast as Fuyumura in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?
        Meeting Shiori Fuyumura during the audition was such a powerful experience that it feels like she’s become a constant presence in my life. I poured everything I have into this role. I’d be thrilled if SANDA reaches a wide audience.
        
        2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?
        A liver so strong that it can handle any alcohol.
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Ichie Ono (Voiced by Anna Nagase)&lt;/h3&gt;
        A classmate of Sanda and best friend of Fuyumura. She suddenly disappeared from their class, and her whereabouts remain unknown. The school considers her dead, but Fuyumura is determined to search for her with Santa Claus’ help.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt;
        1. How did you feel when you were cast as Ono in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?
        Ono was a role that really challenged me. I struggled a lot while developing the character, and I constantly felt a sense of anxiety and tightness in my chest. I hope that feeling comes through in Ono’s portrayal. Please look forward to the broadcast!
        
        2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?
        When I was a kid, I was always the one receiving presents, so this time, I’d like to give something back. Maybe I could help out? Like riding in the sleigh with Santa and delivering presents around town! That sounds like fun.
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Hitoshi Amaya (Voiced by Yuuki Shin)&lt;/h3&gt;
        Sanda’s roommate, also known as “Prince Amaya.” He is one of the few who know Santa Claus’ secret and wants him to return to fulfill an important wish.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt;
        1. How did you feel when you were cast as Amaya in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?
        I’m really excited to be voicing Amaya in SANDA. I enjoyed bringing out his mysterious charm through my performance. This story really makes you reflect on what it means to be an adult. It’s a wonderful series, so please be sure to watch it!
        
        2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?
        I’d love to ask Santa Claus for a Nintendo Switch 2. Even if I don’t get one, just a chance to win the pre-order lottery would be great. I’ve been good, so please! I’d like to play racing games on it!
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Nico Kazao (Voiced by Misato Matsuoka)&lt;/h3&gt;
        Sanda’s fiancée, chosen by the country from birth. She’s a realist who wants to rebel a little before becoming a “responsible adult.” She always acts freely and often swears.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt;
        1. How did you feel when you were cast as Nico in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?
        When I first learned about Nico, I was deeply captivated by her complete freedom from any constraints. She might be someone who truly understands the preciousness of the present moment. I’m genuinely happy to be able to bring her to life! Please watch as these lovable characters struggle and grow together. I poured my heart into this role and had a great time. Thank you for your support!
        
        2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?
        I love eggplant, so I’d want lots of dishes like deep-fried eggplant soaked in light dashi and mapo eggplant!

        &lt;h2&gt;Message from Masahiko Yamazaki, Head of Global Beyblade Business at TOMY Company&lt;/h2&gt;
        We are thrilled to hold the tournament in Los Angeles, the entertainment capital of the world, to determine the top blader, who will advance to the BEYBLADE X WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 2025. On the day of the tournament, the TOMY Company Beyblade development team will also come from Japan to offer their support. Just like in Japan, we’re eagerly looking forward to intense Bey battles in the U.S.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About BEYBLADE&lt;/h2&gt;

Participants can bring their own Beyblades, while beginners can borrow Beyblades and get help learning how to play. In addition, the booth will feature a large screen showing scenes from the TV anime and photo spots designed for anime fans to enjoy.

        Miho Karasawa, who also goes by the stage name TRUE, has just released her 10th anniversary album titled &quot;TRUE the BEST&quot; on February 26 (her debut date)! You may know her for her passionate vocal style and straightforward lyrics in theme songs for anime series like Buddy Complex, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet, Maria the Virgin Witch, Sound! Euphonium, and many others.
        
        Although she has been active as an artist since 2000, she debuted under the name TRUE in 2014, quickly becoming a powerhouse singer, flawlessly performing numerous opening and ending themes each anime season.
        
        We had the lovely opportunity to interview TRUE once more, to talk about the future and reflect on these ten years full of hits and challenges.

        It’s been a year since our last conversation, and we&apos;re so happy to be chatting with you again! So, you recently released an anniversary album, packed with 30 songs and numerous hits. Was it challenging to select and arrange the tracks for this album? And if you had to choose, which song would you say is your favorite?
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        This release includes singles, lead tracks from albums, and key songs that represent my musical journey over the past ten years. With the exception of the first and last tracks, the songs are arranged in the order they were released. It starts with the first track, “TRUE,” and ends with “DelighT,” with the capital T at the end representing the T in TRUE. I wanted it to begin and end with TRUE, which is how the tracklist took shape. Every song holds a special meaning to me, so it’s hard to pick just one favorite.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        That show was the perfect way to wrap up my 10th anniversary. It was my first time performing in a large live house, and the audience’s energy was even greater than I had imagined. I felt that it was a meaningful milestone not just for me, but for the fans as well, marking the end of a decade. Throughout the anniversary year, I held various types of live shows, and I plan to use what I gained from those experiences moving forward.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Now it&apos;s time to celebrate your first decade as an artist, but given everything you&apos;ve accomplished so far, we imagine you&apos;re already planning your next steps. Are you currently working on any new songs or projects to be released soon?

        Yes, I’m trying various new things and plan to put even more effort into live performances both in Japan and overseas. Since last year, I’ve been doing joint live shows with other artists, and through these interactions, I’m working to expand my musical range.
        
        Another goal for the future is to create a theme song for a tokusatsu anime. I will continue my music activities, dreaming of the day that wish comes true.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        In May, you performed three new shows in Japan as part of your TRUE Live Tour PLAY! vol.1 -ReCoda-. How did you prepare for these events?
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        This time, I did my very first hall tour. I felt like I received so many gifts and warm congratulations for my 10th anniversary, and so many people came out to celebrate with me at my shows. 
        
        I’m going to use all that support as fuel to make each live performance a success from this 11th year onward, which will help me grow even more. It’s not exactly going back to my roots, but I’m planning to perform with the same band lineup as my very first live, carefully arranging each song to deliver it thoughtfully. In June, I’m also holding my first-ever Asia tour. It’s a new challenge to see how much I can convey beyond borders and language barriers. I’ll do my best!

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;U/M/A/A has announced that it will release a second installment of “TechnoByobu,” an art piece that combines the spirit of techno with the traditional Japanese craft of folding screens, in 2026. This new series, titled “TB-02: The Ghost in the Shell,” is based on Shirow Masamune’s legendary cyberpunk series The Ghost in the Shell.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“TechnoByobu” is an art piece of a new era that reimagines the works of internationally and domestically acclaimed artists as folding screens made from wafer-thin golden brass leaves, a craft that has been handed down in Japan for over 500 years. The artworks, vividly depicted in vibrant colors on folding screens made entirely of golden brass leaf, have attracted attention as a fusion of traditional and modern art. The first piece, “TB-01: Electronic Fan Girl,” which was inspired by the album artwork of YMO (Yellow Magic Orchestra), generated significant buzz.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“TB-02: The Ghost in the Shell,” based on the world-famous science fiction work The Ghost in the Shell (Shirow Masamune/Kodansha), utilizes the physical medium of a folding screen with cybernetic visuals, creating a next-generation visual that merges past and future.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Scheduled for release in 2026 as part of a series themed around traditional Japanese elegance, the first work in the series boldly features Motoko Kusanagi and the Fuchikoma from Shirow Masamune’s original 1991 manga, on a golden brass leaf background.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Prior to the release, U/M/A/A will unveil the first prototype of the series at Design Shanghai 2025 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.designshanghai.com/&quot;&gt;designshanghai.com&lt;/a&gt;) to be held in Shanghai, China, from June 4, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What is TechnoByobu?&lt;/h2&gt;	
        TechnoByobu’s “techno” originates from the Greek word téchnē, meaning art, technique, or skill. It embodies more than just practical know-how; it’s a philosophical concept that encompasses the intelligence and creativity behind craftsmanship, as well as the futuristic expression of electronic music. Rooted in this background, “techno” is not only the origin of the word “technology” but also a layered term that blends cultural and artistic innovation.
        Based on this philosophy, TechnoByobu is composed of three elements:
        ・Artwork that evokes futurism (art)
        ・Byobu (folding screens), a traditional Japanese craft kept alive by artisans (skill)
        ・Digital certificates guaranteed by technology (technique)
        
        By overlapping these elements, TechnoByobu culminates as an art piece that expresses the multifaceted nature of “Techno.” Moving forward, it will continue to explore new possibilities of expression in collaboration with diverse talents both in Japan and abroad.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About The Ghost in the Shell&lt;/h2&gt;	
        “The Ghost in the Shell” is a science fiction manga series written by manga artist Shirow Masamune, which began serialization in 1989, in Kodansha’s “Young Magazine Pirate Edition.”
        
        The story revolves around Motoko Kusanagi, a full-body cyborg with exceptional skill in both cyber and conventional warfare. With the rank of Major, she leads the aggressive unit “Shell Squad” as they confront highly intricate and sinister crimes. With its realistic art style, the series’ narrative explores the fusion of humans and technology, delving into cyberpunk elements and philosophical themes, while deeply examining topics such as personal identity.
        
        The series has been expanded into various forms including theatrical and TV animations, as well as games. Each of these adaptations offers its own unique story, interpretations, and expressions, distinct from the original manga.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Unveiling of the prototype at Design Shanghai — the World’s First Public Exhibition&lt;/h2&gt;
        Design Shanghai is one of the world’s most prestigious international design events and a driving force in the new frontier-breaking Chinese design world. In 2024, they invited more than 600 brands from 40 countries worldwide to exhibit new products and hold specially organized events. 
        
        At this year’s 2025 Design Shanghai, starting June 4, TechnoByobu’s second installment, “TB-02: The Ghost in the Shell,” will be unveiled to the world for the very first time. During the exhibition, visitors will have the opportunity to see the prototype up close.

        &lt;h2&gt;About Rekiseisha&lt;/h2&gt;
        In its founding year of 1905, Rekiseisha developed a groundbreaking scientific technique that had never been seen before: foil-pressed paper using brass leaf that was just as beautiful as the traditional gold foil (hon-kinpaku) but far more resistant to discoloration over time. This innovative manufacturing method has earned Rekiseisha international acclaim, with its foil products used not only by the Imperial Hotel, the Imperial Household Agency, and Nishi Honganji Temple, but also by global luxury brands such as CHANEL and GUCCI.

        &lt;h2&gt; ASH&apos;s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        Hello, this is ASH. I’m honored to be performing the opening theme and contributing the rap part to the ending theme for Ultraman Omega. It truly feels like a dream to be involved with Ultraman, a series I’ve loved since childhood. I wish I could go back and tell my younger self—the one who used to send letters to Ultraman! Both “BRIGHT EYES” and “Missing Link” are songs about the importance of believing in yourself. I hope these songs plant a seed of courage in your heart.

        &lt;h2&gt;MinaRyn&apos;s Comment&lt;/h2&gt; 
        I’m truly moved to once again be performing an ending theme for the Ultraman series! I sang with all my heart to capture the power and spirit of Ultraman Omega. I hope Omega’s determination to move forward without losing hope in the face of any challenge will resonate with people around the world. 
        It’s a project I’m deeply proud to be part of. Please enjoy the ending theme, performed by ASH and me!

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Bandai Namco Music Live Inc. (Headquarters: Shibuya-ku, Tokyo; Representative: Yoshitaka Tao, President), which operates its music business primarily through record labels, is launching a new label called UNIERA.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;This new label aims to bring out the unique qualities of artists, from emerging talents to seasoned creators, across a range of genres and styles. A combination of the words “Unique” and “Era,” UNIERA seeks to spark a new wave for the next generation. With music at its core, it will embrace diverse cultural touchpoints such as anime, fashion, and toys, expanding its reach in Japan and overseas while offering a space for free expression and new creative possibilities for all artists seeking new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The first four artists to join UNIERA have been announced: LINKL PLANET, an idol group promoting plastic models worldwide; INUWASI, a powerhouse live idol group that sold out at KT Zepp Yokohama in a solo concert this March; majiko, who has over 200 million streams across Asia; and Daoko, known for the hit “Uchiage Hanabi” with Kenshi Yonezu, which has topped 600 million views on YouTube. All four are distinctive talents expected to help shape the future music scene.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;UNIERA will continue to welcome a wide range of artists seeking new challenges. Stay tuned for more from this new label and its rising roster.

        &lt;h3&gt;LINKL PLANET&lt;/h3&gt;
        Like the parts of a plastic model coming together, we’re a group still taking shape—aiming to become idols who connect plastic models with fans, and with the world (the planet). To help more people step into the world of plastic models, we’re learning about their appeal together with our fans and spreading the fun of building them around the globe.

        &lt;p class=&quot;mt30&quot;&gt;
        After over two decades in the industry, Japanese duo nano.RIPE continues to shine. Their latest full album, Hikari wo Hakobumono (“Those Who Carry Light”), was released on March 12, and features 13 tracks—including 10 brand-new songs—built around the theme of “initial impulses.” Even after 15 years since their debut, nano.RIPE remains driven by the same spark that first inspired them to create music.
        
        In this exclusive interview, we catch up with nano.RIPE to talk about the album’s creative process, their evolution as a band, and how they’ve kept their passion alive through the years.

        After a 2-year break, you&apos;ve just released your 8th full  album, Hikari wo Hakobumono. How do you feel about it, and what was the creative process like?
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        During the two and a half years since our last album, we continued making songs and releasing singles. So rather than beginning from a single burst of inspiration, this album consists of 10 tracks carefully selected from songs we created in that period, older pieces, and brand-new ones written specifically for this release. We believe we’ve put together a really strong album this time.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        This tour mainly features songs from the album, but we’re mixing in popular live tracks and making big changes to the setlist in each location! Whether you come to one show or two or three, we’ll make sure the live experience never gets boring!

        What can you tell us about the evolution of nano.RIPE, both musically and as a duo, over the past two decades since you first started?
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        Although we’ve gone through several member changes, I’m really glad we’ve been able to keep going without stopping. When the members change, the sound naturally changes too, but that’s why we’ve made a point of clearly deciding which parts should change and which should stay the same. By focusing on creating music that stays true to nano.RIPE, I feel we’ve been able to grow.
        &lt;/div&gt;

        This is the 15th year since our debut, and our eighth album, but we still have plenty we want to do and sing about. I think that’s because the “initial impulse” we had when we started the band is still with us. This album is packed with that feeling.

In this exclusive interview, she shares her excitement over performing “Palette Days”, the opening theme for Welcome to Japan, Ms. Elf!, and dives into her unique process behind voicing the charming cat-boy Mewi. 
        
        From heartfelt songwriting to her dreams of voicing unexpected roles, Rico Sasaki opens up about her passion, versatility, and the joy she finds in connecting with fans through both music and character.

        Ms. Sasaki, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us. It’s a real pleasure to learn more about one of our favorite artists!				
        
        You&apos;ve had several years of career and nearly a dozen appearances in anime. How are you feeling about your song &quot;Palette Days&quot; being chosen as the opening theme for the anime Welcome to Japan, Ms. Elf!?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;hex hex-chevron ml30&quot; style=&quot;width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        When I heard I was chosen for the theme song, I was truly thrilled and honored! I was also happy when I passed the audition for the role of Mewi, and to be entrusted with the opening theme song as well! I almost jumped for joy.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        And this isn&apos;t your only anime involvement this year. You recently performed as Doloris in the opening of BanG Dream! Ave Mujica and will also be voicing a character in the upcoming Isekai Mokushiroku Mynoghra. How do you personally relate to Welcome to Japan, Ms. Elf!? and what is the connection between your song &quot;Palette Days&quot; and this anime?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        Every show has a completely different world, and getting to both act and sing in each one is truly fun and fulfilling! In Welcome to Japan, Ms. Elf!, I play Mewi, a cute cat-boy with the special ability to control magic stones. To fully bring out his charm, I read the original manga thoroughly, watched cat videos to study their meows, and practiced really hard!
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        “Kimi to Boku no Hoshi” is a song about cherishing and never forgetting emotions—even loneliness and sadness—and turning those feelings into the strength to face tomorrow, with a firm resolve to become a star. It’s like a wish carried on a shooting star. To stir the listener’s imagination, I intentionally used vague expressions, kept the instrumentation simple, and went through many rounds of trial and error, repeatedly sharing my vision as we shaped the song.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Through singing, I can express my true, unfiltered emotions as Rico Sasaki. Through voice acting, I can become someone entirely different. Both are irreplaceable sources of purpose in my life, and getting to pursue something I’ve loved since I was young brings me more joy than anything else.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;strong&gt;
        As an artist with such a distinctive voice, how do you prepare vocally for such varied projects like singing and voice acting? Do you have any special routines?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Eating well and getting plenty of sleep! No matter how motivated or excited I am, if I’m not healthy, I can’t give 100%, and I’d definitely regret that. So before a performance, I’m extra careful about taking care of myself. I also read lots of messages from fans. Even when I’m feeling anxious, their words calm me and make me want to see everyone right away. It instantly blows my fatigue away!

        And to wrap up the interview, is there any unexpected type of role you&apos;d like to voice in the future, such as a ruthless villainess, a quirky mascot character, or something along those lines?
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        I’d love to try voicing a handsome young man! I’ve played young boys around elementary school age before, but I’ve never had the chance to voice a teenage or adult male character, so I’d really like to try it. I’ll study hard to deliver a cool performance that gets everyone’s hearts racing!

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;On May 24, the four-member all-female vocal and dance group PassCode kicked off their latest live tour, “PassCode DESTINY to the NEXT TOUR 2025,” at BayHall in Yokohama, Kanagawa. Additionally, the music video for their new song “DESTINEX,” which began pre-release streaming on May 21, was released on their official YouTube channel.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;INSIGNIA, set for release on June 18, marks PassCode’s first album under their current lineup and their first new album in about four and a half years. The national tour to promote the album will cover 13 shows across 12 cities nationwide and serves as an important lead-up to their long-awaited arena concert, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX,” scheduled for November.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;PassCode’s Yokohama BayHall show kicked off what promises to be an intense year. From the first song, the energy was high both on stage and in the crowd. The members were surprised by the strong reaction to their new pre-release song’s debut performance. With a refreshed setlist, the four delivered a determined show pushing beyond “the other side of destiny,” and the 1,100-strong audience packed into the venue responded enthusiastically. This night suggested the entire tour could be their best yet!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;PassCode’s new album INSIGNIA is set to become a defining work for the group. It includes a carefully chosen selection of popular songs released since Emiri Arima joined, along with six powerful new tracks led by “DESTINEX,” making a total of 12 songs. To celebrate the release, special events are planned in four cities: Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Fukuoka. Stay tuned for more exciting activities from PassCode.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;About PassCode&lt;/h2&gt;
        PassCode consists of four members: Nao Minami, Kaede Takashima, Hinako Ogami, and Emily Arima. They have a versatile repertoire based on a band sound, punctuated by their distinctive shouts and screams, and have performed at numerous major festivals such as SUMMER SONIC and ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL, earning broad support from both rock enthusiasts and idol fans.
        
        After making their major debut in 2016, they released their first international album Ex Libris PassCode in America, Europe, and Canada under the UK’s JPU Records in October 2018. The track “Ichikabachika” from their 2019 album CLARITY was selected as the opening theme for the TV drama Kakegurui season 2 and the movie Kakegurui. In 2020, their single “STARRY SKY,” which was chosen as the theme song for the drama 182 Days Left, earned them their first-ever No. 1 on the Oricon Weekly Single Chart and Billboard JAPAN Weekly Single Chart. They also made their debut appearance on Nippon Broadcasting System’s All Night Nippon 0.
        
        In February 2022, they held their first concert at Nippon Budokan. In 2023, they embarked on their first US tour, “PassCode US / JAPAN TOUR 2023 -GROUNDSWELL-,” which included stops in Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, as well as 11 cities and 12 venues in Japan. In June 2024, they moved to Bandai Namco Music Live. Their September release “WILLSHINE” was chosen as the OP theme for season 2 of the anime SHY, and their new song “SKILLAWAKE” was selected as the OP theme for season 2 of As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I’ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World. Looking ahead, their first arena concert in about three years, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX”, is scheduled for November 2025.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Singer/songwriter mekakushe’s song “Watashi Dake no Polaris” (My One and Only Polaris), which was used in Episode 7 of the TV anime series Kowloon Generic Romance, was released online on May 18.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The super-popular mystery/romance series is based on Jun Mayuzuki (of After the Rain fame)’s latest work, which has sold more than 1.4 million copies.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Following in the footsteps of the ending theme, “Koi no Retronym” (Retronym of Love), mekakushe and Ryohei Sakata (Hifumi Inc.) have created a light and lively rhythm that almost seems to skip along. The end result is a vibrant, heartfelt pop number that’s bursting with colorful stars.
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Mekakushe’s Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
        This song is meant to be a kind of good luck charm. Just like the stars at night, songs can have a distant feeling to them because of how brightly they shine. So, I wrote “Watashi Dake no Polaris” with those thoughts in mind. Even on days when they’re hidden behind the clouds, stars still twinkle with the same intensity. I always want to stare at the special person right beside me, because their brilliant light means I’ll never feel alone!
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Mekakushe’s Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
        Handling lyrics, composition, vocals, and piano performance by herself, the next-generation singer-songwriter Mekakushe enjoys immense popularity among artists and creators. Starting classical piano at the age of three, she gradually gravitated towards pop music. Her independently produced songs were featured in a Kao Laurier commercial, and she was one of the top artists on the Spotify official playlist “Kirakira Pop Japan” with a total of 3 million plays. She is a promising emerging artist with anticipated future success. With electronica as the foundation in her recordings, her musical style continues to expand, featuring classical solos and band sets in live performances.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Animation studio Satelight, known for popular series such as Macross Frontier and Genesis of Aquarion, will celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2025. To mark the occasion, streaming of character songs, the original soundtrack, and the Season 2 ending theme from the TV anime Nobunaga the Fool began on May 23, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Nobunaga the Fool is an original anime created by Shoji Kawamori—who also serves as special advisor at Satelight Inc.—and features his work as series composer and chief director. The show drew attention as a grand sci-fi Sengoku epic where legendary figures from East and West battle using armor-like mobile weapons called “Ikusa Yoroi.” The project also attracted attention for its innovative “multidimensional” approach, linking the anime with stage productions. The series continues to have a loyal fanbase to this day.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The character song collection includes six volumes in total, starting with Vol. 1 Oda Nobunaga (CV: Mamoru Miyano) and Vol. 2 Toyotomi Hideyoshi (CV: Yuki Kaji). These must-listen tracks bring to life powerful characters surviving in a war-torn world.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The original soundtrack is composed by Masaru Yokoyama, known for his work on Mashle and Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans. The Season 2 ending theme, “Ran,” performed by ASUKA, features a powerful yet delicate vocal performance that captures the show’s emotional depth and highlights its characters’ inner struggles.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Together with the already-released opening theme “FOOL THE WORLD” by Minori Chihara, ending theme “AXIS” by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION, and Season 2 opening theme “Breakthrough” by JAM Project, fans can now enjoy the full lineup of Nobunaga the Fool’s memorable music on streaming services.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The all-female vocal and dance group PassCode will release INSIGNIA, their first full album in approximately four and a half years, on June 18. Ahead of the release, one of the new tracks, “DESTINEX,” is now available on various music streaming platforms (released on May 21). In addition, the album’s cover artwork and full tracklist have been revealed.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“DESTINEX” also serves as the title song for PassCode’s long-awaited arena concert, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX,” scheduled for November. The title conveys the meaning of “beyond a predetermined fate.” Before the song was produced, the group launched a sing-along project, gathering voices from fans around the world. Their passionate chorus is featured in the track, creating a powerful collaboration between the members and their fans.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The full album INSIGNIA includes standout tracks such as “Freely / FLAVOR OF BLUE,” which left a strong impression following Emily Arima’s addition to the group in August 2021, along with live staples like “Clouds Across The Moon” and “GROUNDSWELL.” Also featured are “WILLSHINE,” the opening theme for the second season of the anime SHY, and “SKILLAWAKE,” the opening theme for the second season of As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I’ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World. In addition to the lead “DESTINEX,” the album also includes five powerful new songs: “MIRAGE WALKER,” “VIRIVIRI,” “One Time Only,” “A certain Motor-Heart is not working right!” and “Echoes.” There’s no doubt this album marks a new pinnacle in PassCode’s career.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;About PassCode&lt;/h2&gt;
        PassCode consists of four members: Nao Minami, Kaede Takashima, Hinako Ogami, and Emily Arima. They have a versatile repertoire based on a band sound, punctuated by their distinctive shouts and screams, and have performed at numerous major festivals such as SUMMER SONIC and ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL, earning broad support from both rock enthusiasts and idol fans.
        
        After making their major debut in 2016, they released their first international album Ex Libris PassCode in America, Europe, and Canada under the UK’s JPU Records in October 2018. The track “Ichikabachika” from their 2019 album CLARITY was selected as the opening theme for the TV drama Kakegurui season 2 and the movie Kakegurui. In 2020, their single “STARRY SKY,” which was chosen as the theme song for the drama 182 Days Left, earned them their first-ever No. 1 on the Oricon Weekly Single Chart and Billboard JAPAN Weekly Single Chart. They also made their debut appearance on Nippon Broadcasting System’s All Night Nippon 0.
        
        In February 2022, they held their first concert at Nippon Budokan. In 2023, they embarked on their first US tour, “PassCode US / JAPAN TOUR 2023 -GROUNDSWELL-,” which included stops in Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, as well as 11 cities and 12 venues in Japan. In June 2024, they moved to Bandai Namco Music Live. Their September release “WILLSHINE” was chosen as the OP theme for season 2 of the anime SHY, and their new song “SKILLAWAKE” was selected as the OP theme for season 2 of As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I’ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World. Looking ahead, their first arena concert in about three years, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX”, is scheduled for November 2025.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Singer and voice actress Rico Sasaki will release her new single “Majestic Catastrophe” on August 27, 2025. The title track serves as the opening theme for the TV anime Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra: World Conquest Starts with the Civilization of Ruin, which premieres in July 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra is a nation-building fantasy series that follows Takuto Ira, a legendary player who once topped the user rankings in Eternal Nations, a nation-management simulation game set in a fantasy world. While hospitalized, he loses consciousness and wakes up in Idragia, a world that feels just like the game. Thus begins a tale of fantasy and empire-building.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“Majestic Catastrophe,” the anime’s opening theme, builds on Sasaki’s signature rock sound while venturing into new territory with a symphonic metal style that reflects the anime’s world. The powerful, dramatic track is matched by Sasaki’s commanding vocals.&lt;/li&gt; 
        
        &lt;li&gt;The single includes three songs: the title track “Majestic Catastrophe” and two additional tracks, one featuring lyrics written by Sasaki herself.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from Rico Sasaki&lt;/h2&gt;
        I’ll be performing “Majestic Catastrophe,” the opening theme for the TV anime Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra: World Conquest Starts with the Civilization of Ruin! It’s a dark and beautiful song that brings a sense of catharsis. I sang powerfully to reflect its pressing intensity, and delicately, as if searching for hope in the darkness. The heavy chorus, along with lyrics and a melody that evoke an ominous atmosphere, all work together to draw listeners into the depths of a dark musical world. “Majestic Catastrophe” stirs emotions deep within—get ready to be hooked by its irresistible darkness.

        &lt;h2&gt;Rico Sasaki&apos;s Profile&lt;/h2&gt;	
        Born November 10
        Akita Prefecture
        
        Rico Sasaki loved music and singing from a young age and grew up surrounded by various musical influences.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;BANDAI has launched a new IP, “LINK TRAVELERS,” built around two main distribution channels: “SIDE:C (CANDY = Shokugan)” and “SIDE:G (GASHAPON = Capsule Toys).” Angelina 1/3 of Gacharic Spin, also often referred to as “Reiwa era’s Radio Star,” performs the theme song for the first promotional video, now streaming on major music platforms!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Following the major success of the original capsule toy figure series “Gashapon Quest,” LINK TRAVELERS, first revealed in November 2024, is a new project that expands into both the Shokugan and Gashapon markets. The series drew strong anticipation from the moment online pre-orders began, and is officially set to release in May 2025. With highly detailed figures and customizable parts, the new line offers users the freedom to play and create based on their own preferences, while its rich backstory and well-developed world setting will add further depth to the imaginative experience.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The first promotional video, which fully captures the essence of the world, was released on April 28. The promotional video features the song “Transcendence,” which was produced and composed by Eijun Suganami of the rock band THE BLACK HORN, with vocals by Angelina 1/3 of Gacharic Spin. The powerful drumming of Hana of Gacharic Spin, with her intense twin bass performance, also adds to the track. Comments from Angelina 1/3, Eijun Suganami, and K. Sawa, the project lead for LINK TRAVELERS at Bandai, have been released. We invite you to experience a wide array of content, including Shokugan, Gashapon, video, and music!&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Message From Angelina 1/3 (Gacharic Spin)&lt;/h2&gt;
        “I had the honor of singing as one of the voices in the world of LINK TRAVELERS, standing alongside characters who fight through despair in search of light and strength.
        It means so much to me to be part of this powerful project, especially with the incredible Eijun-san, whose work I deeply admire.
        The songs Eijun-san writes always give me the strength to move forward and take me to new places.
        I hope this song can be a source of strength for everyone out there fighting for their own freedom, just like the characters in LINK TRAVELERS.”
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Message From Eijun (THE BACK HORN)&lt;/h2&gt;
        “When creating this song, I focused on capturing the thrilling sense of adventure and the cool, stylish universe of LINK TRAVELERS.
        I wanted the track to feel powerful and liberating, almost like breaking free from the everyday and reaching out toward freedom.
        Angie’s rock vocals are truly one of a kind, and they brought the song to life with incredible energy.
        She’s an amazing vocalist and also has a deep understanding of the world behind the lyrics.
        Thanks to her, the song turned out incredibly energetic, and I’m really happy with how it came together.”
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Message From K. Sawa (Bandai)&lt;/h2&gt;
        “From the opening to the powerful chorus, this song does a fantastic job of fully expressing the world of the first installment of LINK TRAVELERS.
        There’s a line in PV1 that says, “A fateful encounter that sets the gears of destiny in motion will suddenly arrive one day,” and I truly feel that meeting Eijun-san and Angelina 1/3, who created such a beautiful song to accompany the characters embarking on their journeys into the future, was exactly that kind of encounter.
        I hope you’ll listen to the full version and enjoy it!”

        Celebrating a decade of genre-blending innovation and emotional resonance, STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION—helmed by the multi-talented artist and producer RON—marks its 10th anniversary with the release of &quot;STEREO DIVE 03.&quot; In this interview, RON reflects on his evolution as a creator, the balance between artistic vision and collaboration, and the deeply personal threads woven through his latest work.

        RON, thank you very much for this opportunity! It&apos;s great to have you back, and congratulations on the 10th anniversary of STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION! Looking back on the past decade, how has your sound evolved since the release of your debut track “Daisy”? 
        &lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        Over the past decade, I’ve written many songs, not only for myself but also as a music producer for others. Through my various experiences as a musician, I feel that the process of translating musical ideas in my head into concrete output has become more refined. I also sense that my creative repertoire has significantly expanded.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        Your new album &apos;STEREO DIVE 03&apos; features a mix of tie-up songs with anime, as well as original tracks. How do you balance the demands of working on anime theme songs with your personal musical vision?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;row mt40&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        I primarily approach my work in a way that aligns with the anime. From my creative repertoire, I carefully select the musical elements that best suit the series. For parts beyond the first verse that aren’t used in the anime, I sometimes take a more personal approach.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;
        You’ve mentioned that the song &apos;#03&apos;, which opens the album, represents your feelings of “looking forward to the future.” Can you explain more about the meaning behind the track and how it ties into your current journey as an artist?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        
        To mark the 10th anniversary, I wanted to include a special touch. By bringing the intro phrase of “Daisy” to the very end, I aimed to express respect for the beginning while also conveying a sense of appreciation for what’s to come.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Given that you’ve worked in many different contexts throughout these years, how have these experiences shaped your musical style and the way you connect with your audience? And how is that reflected in &apos;STEREO DIVE 03&apos;? 
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-xs-12&quot;&gt;
        In recent years, I’ve had more opportunities to perform in front of overseas audiences. The song “HIKARI,” which is included in the album, was created specifically as a piece that could be sung together with them. When I performed it live, I truly felt a sense of unity, which was an awesome experience.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        Your work as a composer spans multiple genres, from rock to EDM to orchestral arrangements. How do you decide which genre best fits the emotional tone of a song, especially when it’s tied to an anime series?
        &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!---honeyhex----&gt;

        I generally strive to write music in line with the request. When given full creative freedom, I refer to the script, storyboard, or any available footage to determine the appropriate genre and instruments for the scene.

        We’re sure many Honey’s Anime readers have followed your journey, some from the very beginning. Is there anything you’d like to say to them as we wrap up the interview?

        I want to express my gratitude to those who discovered SDF or RON through anime. I’ll continue creating many more songs, so please look forward to them!

        Final Thoughts
        &lt;/h1&gt;
        
        &lt;p class=&quot;mt30&quot;&gt;
        With ten years of boundary-pushing music behind him, RON shows no signs of slowing down. As STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION enters its next phase, his commitment to authenticity, growth, and emotional connection remains unwavering. Whether through anime tie-ins or deeply personal tracks, RON continues to craft music that resonates across cultures and generations—inviting listeners to dive even deeper into the soundscapes he so passionately creates.		
        
        As STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION looks ahead to a new chapter, we also look forward to many more songs from this amazing band. We&apos;ve been here to appreciate these 10 years of music, and we&apos;ll continue to do so in the next decade too!
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

Series Asia Tour 2024 ~Minna de Kanaeru Monogatari~” held in February, where it quickly became a fan favorite.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;In early March, a live performance clip was posted on TikTok, sparking a surge of lip-sync and dance videos featuring the catchy line, “○○-chaaan! Hai! Nani ga suki? (What’s your favorite?)” The trend quickly gained momentum as celebrities, influencers, and even K-pop artists joined in, fueling the viral explosion.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Videos related to the song posted on the official Love Live! TikTok account have surpassed 80 million views, with over 500,000 user-generated posts using the track.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The momentum has carried over to music charts as well, with the song holding the No. 1 spot for 19 consecutive days on Spotify Viral Top 50 – Japan, which highlights the most talked-about tracks on social media. It also reached No. 1 on six other Viral Top 50 charts. On the YouTube Shorts Daily Top Songs Ranking, it broke into the Top 50 in 11 countries and continues to dominate charts around the world (as of April 14).&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The track has also been featured on the cover art of prominent playlists such as Women of Anime (Spotify), Viral Hit Korea (Spotify), and The Short List (YouTube Music).&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The series ARIA, created by manga artist Kozue Amano and directed by Junichi Sato, has been hailed as “one of the best” slice-of-life stories out there. In celebration of the anime ARIA’s 20th anniversary, a special 3-disc album of ARIA’s best hits is scheduled to be released!&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The five main theme songs featured in the trilogy, ARIA the AVVENIRE, ARIA the CREPUSCOLO, and ARIA the BENEDIZIONE, have been recorded on albums by their respective artists before, but never on an ARIA album until now. The first disc will be a collection of 14 opening and ending themes from the anime, the second disc a compilation of 13 insert songs, and the third disc will feature an original collection of songs on piano by pianist and producer Mina Kubota.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;In 2009, ARIA The BOX, a collection of themes and insert songs from the anime, was released with only 10,000 copies available which sold out immediately. The new best-hits album will be the only item once again featuring the complete collection of themes and insert songs from the anime, so you don’t want to miss out.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The album jacket illustration features original artwork by the creator Kozue Amano.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;In addition, the second main visual for ARIA’s 20th anniversary concert has been released. The theme of the visual is “Thank you for 20 years” and features the cast in their respective teams holding various flowers.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Voice actor and singer-songwriter Shugo Nakamura has released his latest song, “Illuminate,” for early streaming on digital services, along with a music video.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Written and composed by Nakamura himself, “Illuminate” serves as the opening theme for the TV anime The Gorilla God’s Go-To Girl. This marks the first time that Nakamura performs an anime opening theme. The song features a brass sound that perfectly captures the feeling of springtime romance, paired with heartfelt and straightforward lyrics that are distinctly his own.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The music video, Nakamura’s first drama-style production featuring a cast, was filmed at an amusement park, creating a vibrant and spring-like atmosphere filled with dazzling visuals. Highlights include scenes shot against a beautifully illuminated carousel and twinkling night lights, offering a fresh new side of Nakamura not seen in his previous music videos.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The physical release is set for April 23 and will be available in both a Limited Edition and a Standard Edition. The Limited Edition includes a Blu-ray featuring the “Illuminate” music video along with behind-the-scenes footage.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Kairiki Bear is a popular Vocaloid producer with over 390 million views on YouTube and various hit songs such as “Venom” and “Darling Dance.” Last year they held their first live performance, Yamiaka Steroid hosted by Spotify O-EAST, which is now scheduled to be released on Blu-ray.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The performance combined Vocaloid with visual art and 3DCG elements, an unprecedented endeavor for a solo live performance by a Vocaloid producer which can only be described as next-generation. Both the afternoon and evening shows were sold-out, proving it was a massive success.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The Blu-ray release will include all 23 songs performed during the evening show, as well the additional 4 songs that were performed exclusively during the afternoon, for a total of 27 songs. In addition, the Blu-ray will also include a story-like video presentation with narration by Nao Toyama.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The first-edition Blu-ray will come with special packaging and an enclosed bonus (contents to be announced later), so be sure to reserve a copy as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Bandai Namco Music Live Inc. has announced that VTuber Kurone Yousagi released her 3rd digital single, “Twinkle Twinkle Little Wing,” under the Lantis label on March 28, 2025.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Through her 1st and 2nd singles, “Acchuu-Ma!” and “Window,” Kurone Yousagi has expressed different facets of her yami-kawa aesthetic. She continues to bring fresh energy to the VTuber and anime music scene in 2025, with events like her online 3D live concert “Flap” on her YouTube channel on March 27.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Her 3rd single, “Twinkle Twinkle Little Wing,” marks the conclusion of her three-month release streak. The song was composed by Mamoru (nhhmbase), who is known for his contributions to idol groups like You’ll Melt More! and Lyrical School, as well as games such as Taiko no Tatsujin. The illustration is a pixel art piece by ahiru-hitsuji, who has also produced music videos for Nijisanji VTuber Suo Sango.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Step into a new frontier of the yami-kawa world, where catchy yet unexpected melodies intertwine with a colorful fusion of electronic sounds, strings, and electric guitar, crafting a richly layered and fantastical soundscape.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Comment from Kurone Yousagi&lt;/h2&gt;
        “Twinkle Twinkle Little Wing” is my third original song! Personally, I think it’s going to be perfect for live performances—I’ve got high expectations! The part I really want you to notice is right before the chorus when I go, “Wah!” in a mischievous kind of way! It’s a classic, high-energy track that anyone can vibe to, so listen to it a ton! Got it?!	
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About Kurone Yousagi&lt;/h2&gt;
        A yami-kawa tsundere VTuber affiliated with MEWLIVE and the “cousin” of voice actress Nozomi Suzuhara.
        
        Kurone is a second-year high school student (currently repeating the year) who adores all things with a sickly-cute aesthetic. While she has a tsundere personality, she occasionally reveals a softer side to those she trusts. She refers to herself as a “lady” and claims to live in a grand mansion, but the reality is...?
        
        As a 1st-generation member of MEWLIVE, a VTuber production operated by Bandai Namco Music Live Co., Ltd., Kurone made her major debut under the company’s Lantis label in 2025. She has also announced three consecutive months of music releases, further expanding her activities.

        &lt;li&gt;This highly-anticipated event aims to spotlight recently published manga and connect fans worldwide with new stories that deserve more recognition on a global scale. For 2025, the project continues to serve as a cultural bridge between creators, publishers, and readers in &lt;b&gt;over 240 countries and territories&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;About “You Should Read This Manga 2025”?&lt;/h2&gt;
        A unique global manga promotion project carried out by world-renowned anime and manga community MyAnimeList in conjunction with industry professionals. The project is the first of its kind, using online nominations from users around the world to produce the ultimate list of manga recommendations for that year. Aside from the main category, “You Should Read This Manga,” the project includes a number of sub-categories, including series that fans would like to see animated.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Categories &amp; Criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
        This global manga discovery project was launched with the goal of inspiring fans around the world to explore lesser-known but highly recommended titles. The final list is created from &lt;b&gt;user-submitted nominations&lt;/b&gt;, which allows fans to vote for up to 10 titles and include persuasive reasoning for why each title should be featured. Titles must have seen an overseas release in 2024, and have a Score and Popularity ranking below #50 on MyAnimeList to be eligible for nomination. The 2025 edition includes four curated categories:
        
        &lt;b&gt;You Should read This Manga 2025&lt;/b&gt;
        For manga that readers simply really want to recommend to a friend!  
        (e.g. Gachiakuta, Magus of the Library, Kagurabachi)
        
        &lt;b&gt;Should Be Anime&lt;/b&gt;
        For manga not adapted into anime within the past 5 years. (e.g. Gokurakugai, Kindergarten Wars, Firefly Wedding)
        
        &lt;b&gt;Best for Beginners&lt;/b&gt;
        For new readers; short, accessible, or recently adapted into anime. (e.g. Dandadan, Smoking Behind the Supermarket with You, RuriDragon)
        
        &lt;b&gt;Unique Art/Story&lt;/b&gt;
        For seasoned manga fans seeking originality in artwork or narrative. (e.g. Veil, Kaiju Girl Caramelise, The Color of the End: Mission in the Apocalypse)
        
        Explore the full list of selected works here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mxj.myanimelist.net/readthismanga/2025/nomination&quot;&gt;mxj.myanimelist.net/readthismanga/2025/nomination&lt;/a&gt;	
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Trends from This Year’s List&lt;/h2&gt;	
        
        &lt;b&gt;Demographic Balance&lt;/b&gt;: Half of the selected titles were originally published in shounen or seinen magazines. Notably, one in four of these titles received more votes from female readers.
        &lt;b&gt;Digital Origins&lt;/b&gt;: 25% of the titles come from web-based manga platforms such as Shonen Jump+ or Manga UP.
        &lt;b&gt;Anime Demand&lt;/b&gt;: Over half the “Should Be Anime” picks are shounen, with two-thirds of these available for free via MANGA Plus.
        &lt;b&gt;Female Reader Influence&lt;/b&gt;: The “Unique Art/Story” list saw the majority of votes come from female users, in contrast to the other lists.
        &lt;b&gt;Breakout Titles&lt;/b&gt;: Girls love/yuri manga The Guy She Was Interested in Wasn&apos;t a Guy at All had total nominations almost equal to all GL titles combined from the previous year. Likewise, new nominations for action manga Kagurabachi doubled any other action title.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Additional Content&lt;/h2&gt;
        The project also features bonus recommendation sections created in collaboration with manga publishers and booksellers:

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Maebashi Witches is an upcoming original TV anime produced by Sunrise Studio of Bandai Namco Filmworks, known for titles such as Mobile Suit Gundam and Love Live! The full-length version of its opening theme, “Sugosugi Maebashi Witches!”, is now available for streaming. Performed by the Maebashi Witches, a five-member voice actor idol group portraying the anime’s main characters, the song features lyrics by Tsunku♂, composition by TORIENA, and arrangement by Yuki Kishida.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Blending the classic sound of the Japanese idol scene with infectious refrains, powerful kicks, and deep bass, this track is also a perfect fit for anime club playlists. Don’t miss it!
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Creator Comments:&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Lyrics: Tsunku♂&lt;/b&gt;
        I think everyone has childhood memories of playing flower fortune-telling—plucking petals one by one, eagerly anticipating the final answer. Even with only two possible outcomes, it always felt exciting.
        
        With that theme in mind, I wove the cast members’ names and various types of flowers into the melody to create this song. Writing the lyrics felt like solving a complex jigsaw puzzle—I was so immersed that time just flew by. 
        
        The protagonists are adorable, and with a story full of youthful passion and a sense of achievement, I’m really looking forward to watching the show.
        
        &lt;b&gt;Composition: TORIENA&lt;/b&gt;
        I composed this song with the hope that each member of the Maebashi Witches would shine brightly. I think it’s a lively and adorable track. Super amazing Maebashi Witches!
        
        &lt;b&gt;Arrangement: Yuki Kishida&lt;/b&gt;
        Congratulations on the full-length release! First and foremost, I’m truly honored to have been part of this project. I still remember how excited I was when I first received the demo—it was already amazing. As I worked on it, I kept thinking about how I could contribute to make it even better. My goal was to create a sound that you’d want to hear anywhere—on TV, through your phone, or even in a club. I hope people enjoy it in all kinds of places!

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;TRIGGER, the group from Idolish7, has released their third original album, Trois. Based on the grand concept of Lueur des Trois (“The Light of Three”), the album is structured as a grand ensemble divided into three movements: Origine, Passion, and Scène. Each section opens with “Prelude: Lueur des Trois,” while the individual tracks tell the story of TRIGGER’s origin, passion, and journey to the stage. Listeners are invited to immerse themselves in the symphonic poem of Lueur des Trois.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Among the standout tracks are “Triple Down,” an emotional and progressive dance music piece produced by Ryo Takahashi, with rhythmic and seductive lyrics by multi-artist R・O・N., as well as “Sol,” an innovative electronic track composed by Taiki Kudo from the dance vocal group Da-iCE.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The special limited edition includes a bonus CD featuring the unaccompanied violin suite “Suites pour violon seul ‘Trois,’” which weaves together themes from the three movements, along with a self-remix of the lead track “Triple Down -VC’s ‘Hermetic Art’ UKG Remix-.” This edition also includes an original acrylic stand featuring a newly drawn illustration by manga artist Arina Tanemura.&lt;/li&gt;

        A unit formed by voice actresses Natsumi Murakami and Chiemi Tanaka, who made their artist debut under Lantis. The name “NACHERRY” is a combination of their first names (Natsumi and Chiemi) and symbolizes the idea of “two-in-one,” like a double cherry. They chose this name to reflect their desire to have twice as much fun while complementing each other’s strengths.
        
        Built around the concept of “constant excitement with girls who are open about what they love and never lose their sense of fun,” NACHERRY delivers upbeat, American-style rock songs with a vibrant, poppy energy, bringing excitement to audiences.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;It was recently announced that the ending theme song for upcoming anime Aru Majo ga Shinu Made, airing April 1, will be sung by Aoi Teshima. The song “Hana Saku Michi de” was written and arranged by songwriter Yuki Kajiura.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;You can listen and watch the newest music video for the anime that was released today featuring a short version of the song.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Aru Majo ga Shinu Made is a heartwarming fantasy about Meg, a 17-year-old apprentice witch, who is told by her long-lived teacher, Faust, that a terrible curse has left her with only one year to live. In order to break the curse, Meg sets out to bring happiness to those around her and collect the joyful tears shed by 1,000 people within a year.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The ending theme song “Hana Saku Michi de” was produced by songwriter and composer Yuki Kajiura, who has gained a huge following around the world thanks to her work on the soundtracks for many popular anime. This song is a collaboration between two artists leading at the forefront of their respective genres.
        &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;A Message from Aoi Teshima:&lt;/h2&gt;
        
        I had the pleasure of singing the ending theme song for Aru Majo ga Shinu Made, “Hana Saku Michi de.” This was my first time singing something written by Yuki Kajiura. The words and melody felt nostalgic somehow and I was able to really put my heart into it. It would make me happy if you all enjoyed the anime all the way to the ending theme as well.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The newest installment by Sunrise (Bandai Namco Film Works) in the Macross franchise was first announced during “Walküre FINAL LIVE TOUR 2023 ~Last Mission~”. During ABEMA’s live broadcast of the “Macross X Sunrise New Animation Announcement Special”, it was announced that auditions for the next song princess in the new series will be held in 2025. Music production for the anime will be a collaborative effort by labels FlyingDog and Lantis (Bandai Namco Music Live).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Music for the new series will be produced by FlyingDog, who has headed music production for the franchise thus far, and Lantis (Bandai Namco Music Live), the producer of hit series LoveLive!. This powerful duo produced a brand new theme song for the auditions to be the next Macross song princess. The song &quot;I to I&quot; combines a sense of speed and passion, and with the catchy phrase &quot;Hear this whole-hearted song!&quot;, it’s giving fans high hopes for the upcoming series.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Auditions will be accepted until Wednesday, April 30, 11:59 PM (JST). Those interested in auditioning can enter by uploading a video of oneself singing the song “I to I” to YouTube. The song is available to download for those interested in making derivative works such as dance or instrumental videos as well. Those uninterested in the audition are also welcome to participate.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Additionally, there will be videos uploaded every week of past Macross song princesses and special guests singing the theme song as part of a special campaign to promote the new series. The first video of the campaign features Minori Suzuki, winner of the Macross Delta song princess audition and voice of the heroine Freyja Wion. There will be more videos of special guests singing along to “I to I” released every week for everyone to enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Information about the audition and special guest covers of “I to I” will be available on the official audition website, YouTube, X, Instagram and TikTok accounts. Follow for the latest updates.

        &lt;ul class=&quot;ul-news&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Bandai Namco Music Live Inc. has announced that VTuber Kurone Yousagi has digitally released her second single, “Window,” under the Lantis label. Along with the release, a music video has been unveiled, and a 3D live concert is scheduled for March 27, 2025.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;“Window” was written and composed by KAIRUI, who received praise for his first album Hoshi no Watashi, released by Maltine Records in January, and is also creating music for PROJECT IM@S vα-liv. The illustration and music video were created by iamuu_n, known for producing videos for the virtual singer Ui, whose character design and voice were created by Shigure Ui. This track offers a fresh side of Kurone Yousagi’s world, distinct from her first single, “Acchuu-Ma!”&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;Additionally, on March 27, 2025—the day before the release of the third and final song in her three-month consecutive release schedule—Kurone Yousagi will hold an online 3D live concert on her YouTube channel. Featuring original songs, covers, and special announcements, this event will showcase how she has evolved since her 3D debut stream last year.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;About Kurone Yousagi&lt;/h2&gt;
        A yami-kawa tsundere VTuber affiliated with MEWLIVE and the “cousin” of voice actress Nozomi Suzuhara.
        
        Kurone is a second-year high school student (currently repeating the year) who adores all things with a sickly-cute aesthetic. While she has a tsundere personality, she occasionally reveals a softer side to those she trusts. She refers to herself as a “lady” and claims to live in a grand mansion, but the reality is...?
        
        As a 1st-generation member of MEWLIVE, a VTuber production operated by Bandai Namco Music Live Co., Ltd., Kurone made her major debut under the company’s Lantis label in 2025. She has also announced three consecutive months of music releases, further expanding her activities.

Anime enthusiasts are invited to craft captivating tales inspired by two prompts: “Love Transcends Boundaries” and “The End is Now.” Centered on themes of love and death, the contest seeks page-turning stories that will ignite the imaginations of new readers on the NOVELOUS platform.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;The NOVELOUS app promises to bridge the gap between global audiences and the beloved Japanese storytelling format of light novels.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;li&gt;To celebrate its launch, NOVELOUS has partnered with MyAnimeList and Honeyfeed to bring fresh, original talent into the spotlight. Through &quot;MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 - NOVELOUS Worlds,&quot; authors from around the world are invited to showcase their creativity, with a chance to have their works featured on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Prompts&lt;/h2&gt;
        The contest challenges writers to craft compelling stories based on one of two prompts:
        
        “&lt;b&gt;Love Transcends Boundaries:&lt;/b&gt;” Explore the power of love to overcome cultural barriers and obstacles, highlighting bonds that defy the odds.	
        
        “&lt;b&gt;The End is Now:&lt;/b&gt;” Dive into a world on the brink of destruction, where humanity has only one year left—how will people respond to the ultimate countdown?	
        
        &lt;h2&gt;How it Works&lt;/h2&gt;
        Submissions will be hosted on Honeyfeed, a platform for aspiring novelists, from February 11, 2025, to May 7, 2025. After the submission period, a panel of judges will select finalists, and fans worldwide will participate in the voting phase, from June 23 to July 24, 2025, on NOVELOUS. Winning stories will be announced on August 4, 2025.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Prizes&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;About NOVELOUS&lt;/h2&gt;
        NOVELOUS is an app for reading Japanese light novels. While many people are already familiar with the countless anime and manga series born in Japan, light novels, which often serve as their source material, remain lesser-known. This is partly due to the lack of widespread translations. Through NOVELOUS, Shogakukan, one of Japan’s leading publishers, will introduce North American readers to light novels that have yet to gain wide recognition, offering translations directly from the source.
        
        &lt;h2&gt;About MyAnimeList&lt;/h2&gt;

Founded in 2004, MyAnimeList has become a crucial source of information for overseas fans, especially among Generation Z in North America.
