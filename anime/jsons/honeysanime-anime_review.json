In conjunction with the opening of the first-ever Ghost in the Shell exhibition “Ghost and the Shell”, currently being held at NODE Tokyo, it was announced that the latest TV anime production of Ghost in the Shell will be airing in Japan starting July 2026. The very first key visual and promotional video was released as well.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The first key visual and original artwork from the series is currently on display at the “Ghost and the Shell” exhibition.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The musical producers for the new series have also been announced!

In addition, Ryo Konishi, who served as the music director the Osaka World Expo and produces for artists such as Chara+YUKI, Mrs. Green Apple, TOMOO and more, will be collaborating with U.S.-based composer Yuki Kanesaka, who produced the music for TV anime Dr. Stone. </li>\r\n\r\n<li>Updates will be posted to the new Ghost in the Shell website and official social media accounts.</li>\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xl8bNn3BRRM\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Ghost in the Shell Exhibition “Ghost and the Shell” </b>\r\n<a href=\"http://tokyonode.jp/sp/exhibition-ghostintheshell\">tokyonode.jp/sp/exhibition-ghostintheshell</a>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>About Taisei Iwasaki</h2>\r\nAward-winning musician who’s known for his work on Ryuu to Sobakasu Hime, Hateshinaki Scarlet, Giant God Warrior Appears in Tokyo, TV anime Kekkai Sensen, Spriggan, Marriage Toxin, and more.\r\n\r\nMoteki and Ryuu to Sobakasu Hime won the 35th and 45th Japan Academy Awards for “Best Music” respectively, while Ryuu to Sobakasu Hime went on to win the 36th Japan Golden Disc Award for “Best Soundtrack of the Year”.\r\n\t\r\n<h3>Comment from Taisei Iwasaki</h3>\r\n“In middle school, I came across a magazine with an illustration of Motoko Kusanagi inside. That was the moment when I discovered Ghost in the Shell. Its unique touch and color set it apart from other works. Even the author’s name, Masamune Shirow, captivated me. I was stunned. I’ve since encountered the series in various forms. Now, I am truly honored to be a part of this project and its long history. The concept I envisioned for this project is “Sound Public Security Sector 9”. With the help of my talented friends, I will strive to make this long-awaited work even better. May we all come together soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About Ryo Konishi</h2>\r\nBorn July 25, 1988 in Tokyo.\r\n\r\nMusical composer, arranger, and performer on saxophone, flute, clarinet, synthesizer, and vocoder. He served as the musical director for the opening ceremony of the Osaka World Expo, and has produced for numerous theatre productions, drama productions, and artists including Chara+YUKI, Mrs. Green Apple, TOMOO and more. His style as a performer involves mastering and playing multiple instruments, making him a valuable multi-instrumentalist in multiple settings including Chara and Millenium Parade led by Daiki Tsuneta. He’s participated in numerous festivals both domestically and internationally, including NHK’s “Kohaku Uta Gassen”, Fuji Rock Festival, and Summer Sonic.\r\n\r\n<h3>Comment from Ryo Konishi</h3>\r\n“I first watched Innocence when I was in junior high school. Ever since my heart was stolen by its intense charm, I’ve pursued everything related to Ghost in the Shell. Its influence is deeply ingrained into my own work and philosophy. At first, I couldn’t believe that I was entrusted with creating music for this work, but I wanted to embrace this precious world. With that feeling in my heart, I took on this project with my entire body and soul. Follow the whispers of my ghost!”\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>About Yuki Kanesaka</h2>\r\nA music creator and composer based in Boston, creating music daily across the U.S. and Europe. In recent years, he’s been working as an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music, discovering music and developing technology, while also developing products for companies like \r\n\r\nSony and AlphaThetha/Pioneer. He enjoys working and can play around 74 instruments.\r\nRecent works:\r\n- Shiryu Sejima (artist)\r\n- Dr. Stone/Jujutsu Kaisen/Snowball Earth (anime music)\r\n- olkswagen/Kyupi/Meiji/Yonex (commercial music)\r\n- Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure/Sonic Racing (game music)\r\n\r\n<h3>Comment from Yuki Kanesaka</h3>\r\n“I began with a single utterance: “Ghost in the Shell? Never heard of it!”, before immediately ordering every English and Japanese version I could get on Amazon. As I dove into composing at my private studio in Boston, a vast number of motifs began preparing for their musical journey. To Nashville, where my allies wait, for additional recordings. To a Shanghai hotel, for tailoring. Finally, the motifs’ journey comes to an end in Tokyo, transforming from a phenomenon called “a passage” into a message called “a suite”. A journey without hesitation, without blurring, without rewriting. These songs are like maps, etched with a trail of my thoughts and impulses.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Ghost in the Shell Official Accounts</b>\r\nOfficial Website: <a href=\"http://theghostintheshell-anime.jp\">theghostintheshell-anime.jp</a>\r\nOfficial X: @thegits_animeEN\r\nOfficial Instagram: @thegits_anime\r\n\t\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

The English-language isekai fantasy novel contest was held on Honeyfeed, a novel submission platform operated by qdopp, with the goal of discovering exceptional storytelling talent from around the world. The winning works were announced today on the contest’s official webpage.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Out of a total of 1,240 entries, one Grand Prize winner and two Contest Winners Prize recipients were selected.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<b>MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 – THE ISEKAI presented by KADOKAWA Webpage:</b>\r\n<a href=\"http://mhwc.myanimelist.net/202507\">mhwc.myanimelist.net/202507</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>Grand Prize\r\n\t“Isekai’d with my dog, I'm not the hero?!” by Frettiko</h2>\r\nAn average guy named Mitsuta is reincarnated into another world along with his pet dog, Toast. However, the goddess becomes utterly smitten with the adorable Toast and grants all of the hero’s bonuses to him instead. For a level 99 “Hero” Pomeranian, defeating monsters is a walk in the park. Meanwhile, his owner Mitsuta remains stuck at level 1...\r\n\t\r\nConstantly dragged along by the free-spirited Toast, Mitsuta gathers a group of quirky companions and runs an odd-jobs business, gradually carving out a place for himself in this new world. At this rate, they might even end up defeating the Demon King someday? A fluffy, feel-good comedy about a fun-filled isekai life with a beloved pet.\r\n\t\r\n<a href=\"https://www.honeyfeed.fm/novels/25397\">Go read “Isekai’d with my dog, I'm not the hero?!” on Honeyfeed</a>.\t\r\n\r\n<h2>Contest Winners Prize\r\n\t“HR in Another World: Building the Strongest Parties with my Appraisal Skill” by Kaorin</h2> \r\nHiroyuki, an HR manager, is summoned to another world by a goddess. He has no combat ability whatsoever, but armed with the Divine Appraisal skill, which reveals hidden potential, he recruits allies and assembles the ultimate party.\r\n\t\r\nAs Hiroyuki builds his team, however, the shadow of an assassin targeting him draws near... In a world far harsher than expected, can this hero’s party stand up to the Demon Lord’s army? A grand adventure begins as Hiroyuki uses his appraisal skills to save the world.\r\n\t\r\n<a href=\"https://www.honeyfeed.fm/novels/21714\">Go read “HR in Another World: Building the Strongest Parties with my Appraisal Skill” on Honeyfeed</a>.\t\r\n\r\n<h2>Contest Winners Prize\r\n\t“Drinking Buddies: Hangover In Another World!” by Literate_Manul</h2>\r\n\r\nMarcus and Gus are transported to another world while hungover. Desperate to impress an elf princess, they end up boasting that they will “defeat one of the Demon Lord’s generals.” By sheer chance, Marcus awakens to beer magic and starts blasting beer while shouting “Hop Missile!”, while Gus’s right arm, whose power he cannot consciously control, suddenly awakens... With zero ability and zero planning, but unmatched bravado, these two men launch into a wildly unpredictable isekai buddy comedy!\r\n\t\r\n<a href=\"https://www.honeyfeed.fm/novels/25347\">Go read “Drinking Buddies: Hangover In Another World” on Honeyfeed</a>.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Overall Review by KADOKAWA’s Editorial Department</h2>\r\nKADOKAWA’s first English-language novel contest on Honeyfeed received 1,240 submissions, the highest number in the platform’s contest history. We are deeply honored by this response and delighted to see such strong interest from English-speaking creators in Japan’s light novel market.\r\nFollowing a rigorous selection process, one Grand Prize winner and two Contest Winners Prize recipients were selected. After initial voting by Honeyfeed users and volunteers, the final judging was conducted by Aneko Yusagi (author of The Rising of the Shield Hero) and editors from KADOKAWA.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prize winner, Isekai’d with My Dog, I’m Not the Hero?!, stood out for its catchy, approachable premise, making it easy to imagine on the shelves of Japanese bookstores. The novel delivers plenty of laugh-out-loud comedic moments, along with charming portrayals of Toast, the adorable dog. We were eager to read more about Toast’s exploits, his bond with the protagonist Mitsuta, and Mitsuta’s growth over the course of the story.\r\nThe author, Frettiko, will receive a cash award of USD 5,000. The winning work will also be assigned a KADOKAWA editor and is scheduled for translation and publication in Japan, with a target release in 2027.\r\n\r\nThe first Contest Winners Prize recipient, HR in Another World: Building the Strongest Parties with My Appraisal Skill, made effective use of the appraisal skill trope that has become a staple of the isekai genre, while capturing the distinctive feel of Japanese web novels. At the same time, its expansive setting evoked the scope of a large-scale open-world game. The careful portrayal of each character, along with story developments involving figures whose allegiance is unclear, added depth and originality to the narrative. \r\nThe author, Kaorin, will receive a cash award of USD 3,000. The work will also be assigned a KADOKAWA editor and revised with the aim of translation and publication in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe second Contest Winners Prize recipient, Drinking Buddies: Hangover in Another World!, is a lighthearted comedy that keeps the pages turning. Its one-of-a-kind tone, blending concepts like “beer magic” with a chunibyo-style demonic arm, creates a brand of absurd humor that is strangely compelling. The two protagonists, Marcus and Gus, drinking buddies from our world, are character types rarely seen in Japanese fiction and are likely to feel fresh and distinctive to Japanese readers. \r\nThe author, Literate_Manul, will receive a cash award of USD 3,000. The work will also be assigned a KADOKAWA editor and revised with the aim of translation and publication in Japan.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, KADOKAWA plans to continue hosting web novel contests in Japan and abroad to discover talented writers from around the world who share a passion for Japanese entertainment content.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment from Aneko Yusagi (author of The Rising of the Shield Hero) on the Grand Prize-Winning Work</h2>\r\nIsekai’d with My Dog, I’m Not the Hero?! feels like a novel written with a strong understanding of Japanese light novels. The characters are comical, the pacing is brisk, and the story offers a genuinely light, comedic reading experience. I read it with excitement, eager to see what would unfold in the misadventures of this delightfully mismatched party.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 – THE ISEKAI presented by KADOKAWA</h2>\r\nThrough this contest, KADOKAWA opened submissions worldwide for English-language isekai fantasy novels, looking for the next hit to follow in the footsteps of globally popular hits such as Overlord, Re:ZERO − Starting Life in Another World, The Rising of the Shield Hero, Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation, and Sword Art Online.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>About KADOKAWA’s Global UGC Content Development Project</h2>\r\nIn recent years, Japanese anime has surged in popularity worldwide, with many hit titles originating from light novels. In parallel, overseas online novel platforms have seen a growing number of works influenced by Japanese light novels, becoming fertile ground for creators with global potential. In response, KADOKAWA launched the Global UGC Content Development Project in 2025 as part of its Global Business Acceleration Program, which supports new overseas-oriented business initiatives. Through this project, KADOKAWA aims to discover global talent from international novel submission platforms and publish their works in Japan and abroad to create new hit IPs.\r\n\r\nThe MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 – THE ISEKAI presented by KADOKAWA represents the first step in this effort. As another initiative under the same project, KADOKAWA also held the “Japan Debut Showdown☆Fantasy Light Novel Contest” in 2025 on KadoKado, a novel submission platform operated by Kadokawa Taiwan Corporation that accepts submissions in Traditional Chinese. The announcement of the winning works is scheduled for June 2026.\r\n\r\nIn addition, plans are underway to publish Why Kill? When Witches Can Be Tentacled!, a work submitted to Honeyfeed, as well as selected winning titles from the JNC Original Light Novel Contest hosted by M12 Media LLC.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About Honeyfeed</h2>\r\nHoneyfeed is a leading writing platform that empowers authors to create, share, and engage with their original stories.

While many people are already familiar with the countless anime and manga series born in Japan, light novels, which often serve as their source material, remain lesser-known. This is partly due to the lack of widespread translations. Through NOVELOUS, Shogakukan, one of Japan’s leading publishers, will introduce North American readers to light novels that have yet to gain wide recognition, offering translations directly from the source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About Honeyfeed</h2>\r\nHoneyfeed is a leading writing platform that empowers authors to create, share, and engage with their original stories. With a vibrant community of readers and writers, Honeyfeed provides an immersive space for storytelling across various genres, including anime and manga-inspired narratives.

A new artist photo has also been released.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>The new song is titled “Ribbon” and is scheduled for digital release in April to coincide with the anime’s broadcast.

After releasing the EP GOLDEN JUNKIE last October and holding a solo concert in December, majiko continues to expand her activities in the music scene.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Comment From majiko</h2>\r\nI had the honor of writing a brand-new song titled “Ribbon” for the opening of The Food Diary of Miss Maid. When I read the story, I remember feeling my heart slowly warm, thinking, “What a gentle, heartwarming world this is...!” As I reflected on where I had felt this kind of warmth before, I realized it was in my interactions with all of you, my fans. \r\n“Ribbon” is a song I wrote by blending Suzume-chan’s bright way of finding happiness in everyday life with the many heartfelt feelings I’ve received from my fans. \r\nI would be happy if this song, along with the series, could softly tie itself into your daily lives as well.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Product Information</h2>\r\n\t<b>GOLDEN JUNKIE</b>\r\nNow available on music streaming websites:\r\n<a href=\"http://lnk.to/GOLDEN_JUNKIE\">lnk.to/GOLDEN_JUNKIE</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About majiko</h2>\r\nSince 2010, majiko has been posting cover songs on video-sharing platforms, gradually building a following in the online scene. She writes, composes, arranges, and illustrates her own work, showcasing her multifaceted talents across a range of creative activities. In recent years, she has held solo shows in China and Taiwan, and with over 200 million streams across Asia, her growing success is now drawing attention both regionally and worldwide.\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: <a href=\"http://majiko.net\">majiko.net</a>\r\nYouTube: <a href=\"http://youtube.com/user/majikoofficial\">youtube.com/user/majikoofficial</a>\r\nX: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/majakoja\">twitter.com/majakoja</a>\r\nInstagram: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/_majiko\">instagram.com/_majiko</a>_\r\nTikTok: <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@majiko_official\">tiktok.com/@majiko_official</a>\r\nFacebook: <a href=\"http://facebook.com/majikoofficial\">facebook.com/majikoofficial</a>\r\nWeibo: <a href=\"http://weibo.com/u/7053204102\">weibo.com/u/7053204102</a>\r\nBiliBili: <a href=\"http://space.bilibili.com/2024958074?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0\">space.bilibili.com/2024958074?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0</a>\r\nPINUPS artist: <a href=\"http://hpinupsartist.jp\">hpinupsartist.jp</a>\r\nUNIERA: <a href=\"http://uniera-label.jp\">uniera-label.jp</a>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

Originally announced as the first track of Phase 3, a new chapter in the band’s career that began on New Year’s Day, the song has now been revealed as the opening theme for season 2 of the anime Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, which begins airing on January 16.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>A music video for “lulu.” was also surprise-released on Mrs. GREEN APPLE’s official YouTube channel. Ahead of this release, a YouTube livestream began at 10:00 p.m. on January 11 after only the stream URL was posted on social media, without prior explanation. The livestream ran for approximately two hours before transitioning directly into the premiere of the “lulu.” music video, with peak concurrent viewership exceeding 200,000.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Unlike Phase 2, when music videos were typically announced in advance, the release of “lulu.” took place without prior notice, marking an unpredictable start to Phase 3 for Mrs. GREEN APPLE.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/MjeiIal1ZR0\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Comment from Motoki Ohmori (Vo/Gt)</h2>\r\nI’ve loved the series since the original manga, so it’s an honor to be involved.\r\n“lulu.” is a song about life, treasured things, memories, and will being passed from one person to another, flowing steadily into today and on to tomorrow. It also conveys the strength to move forward while carrying one’s hometown in one’s heart.\r\nAs a fan of Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, I’m already very much looking forward to what this season will depict. I hope you’ll enjoy “lulu.” alongside the series.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/RH-FcW94z00\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Song Information</h2>\r\nMrs. GREEN APPLE\r\nDigital Single\r\nTitle: lulu.\r\nOP theme for Season 2 of Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End\r\nRelease Date: January 12, 2026\r\n<a href=\"http://lnk.to/MGA_lulu_0112\">lnk.to/MGA_lulu_0112</a>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>About Mrs. GREEN APPLE</h2>\t\r\nMotoki Ohmori (Vo/Gt)\r\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/motoki_ohmori_mga\">instagram.com/motoki_ohmori_mga</a>\t\r\nHiroto Wakai (Gt)\r\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hiloto_wakai_mga\">instagram.com/hiloto_wakai_mga</a>\r\nRyoka Fujisawa (Key)\r\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ryoka_fujisawa_mga\">instagram.com/ryoka_fujisawa_mga</a>\r\n\r\nMrs. GREEN APPLE was formed in 2013 and made their major debut in 2015 with the mini-album Variety. After releasing their best album 5 in July 2020, the band temporarily suspended activities before resuming in March 2022 following a hiatus of approximately one year and eight months. Their return was marked by the comeback concert “Utopia” and the release of the mini-album Unity on July 8. Later that year, they released “Soranji,” the theme song for the film Fragments of the Last Will.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, their 10th anniversary year, Mrs. GREEN APPLE released the album ANTENNA, staged their largest arena tour to date along with their first dome shows, won the Japan Record Award with “Que Sera Sera,” and made their debut appearance on NHK’s Kohaku Uta Gassen with “Dance Hall.” In 2024, they released “Nachtmusik,” the theme song for the film Silent Love, followed by “Lilac,” the opening theme for the TV anime Oblivion Battery.\r\n\r\nAcross major streaming platforms, 31 of the band’s songs have each surpassed 100 million plays. Among them, “Ao to Natsu” has exceeded 900 million plays, while multiple tracks including “Tenbyou no Uta (feat. Sonoko Inoue),” “Dance Hall,” and “Lilac” have surpassed 800 million. According to Billboard JAPAN and Oricon, Mrs. GREEN APPLE is the first artist in history to exceed 11 billion cumulative domestic streams across all songs.\r\n\r\nIn 2025, marking the 10th anniversary of their debut, the band released their anniversary best album 10 on July 8, along with seven new songs, including the opening theme for the second cour of season 2 of the TV anime The Apothecary Diaries. They won three titles on the Oricon Yearly Rankings 2025 and seven titles on the Billboard JAPAN 2025 Year-End Charts. In addition, their anniversary best album 10 surpassed 1 million copies in cumulative sales, achieving million-seller status on the December 22 edition of the Oricon Daily Album Ranking.\r\n\r\nOfficial Website\r\n<a href=\"https://new.mrsgreenapple.com/\">new.mrsgreenapple.com</a>\r\nOfficial YouTube\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@MrsGREENAPPLE_Official/videos\">youtube.com/@MrsGREENAPPLE_Official/videos</a>\r\nOfficial Twitter\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AORINGOHUZIN\">twitter.com/AORINGOHUZIN</a>\r\nOfficial Instagram\r\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mgaband/?hl=ja\">instagram.com/mgaband</a>\r\nOfficial TikTok\r\n<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@mga_band_official\">tiktok.com/@mga_band_official</a>\r\nOfficial Facebook\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Mrs.GREENAPPLEofficial\">facebook.com/Mrs.GREENAPPLEofficial</a>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

Featuring ten all-new songs, the album reflects her journey to date and the future she is moving toward as an artist.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Each track is built around themes closely connected to Sasaki herself, with the album as a whole shaped by the choices she has made and the people she has encountered along the way, including detours and unexpected turns.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The limited first-press edition will include a bonus track, “Tezukuri no Uta,” the first song for which Sasaki wrote both the lyrics and music herself.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>In addition, tracks from the album will be released digitally over five consecutive months ahead of the full release. The first advance track, “Maru de Matryoshka,” is now available on streaming services.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment from Rico Sasaki</h2>\r\nThe full album RI PATHOS represents the path I have walked so far. Even when things didn’t go smoothly, moments of uncertainty or stopping to move at my own pace were all important parts of that journey. I believe the time I spent taking those detours was necessary to connect with people I could never have met by moving straight ahead. Driven by passion, this album captures, in new songs, the moments when my soul was deeply moved.

Ahead of the release, the group has unveiled new artist photos, the EP’s jacket artwork, and the music video for “AISHITEYO,” one of the tracks featured on Amethyst.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The new visuals feature a black-and-white palette set against the theme color of amethyst. Styling that layers contrasting materials such as lace, fur, and leather reflects REIRIE’s balance of stillness and movement. Their delicate yet sharp demeanor leaves a strong impression as the start of a new chapter.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Amethyst will be released in three editions: the REI Edition, the RIE Edition, and the Standard Edition. The REI Edition includes a Blu-ray featuring footage from the free live show “JAM,” held on September 12 at Kabukicho Tower Stage, while the RIE Edition comes with a Blu-ray of the Tokyo performance from REIRIE Live Tour 2025 -BaD＝DoLL-, held on October 26. As a first-press bonus, all editions will include one randomly selected trading card from a set of six.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The EP comprises five tracks rooted in guitar rock, incorporating emotional, alternative, and R&B elements that highlight the duo’s expressive range and vocal contrast. The advance digital single “BaD＝DoLL,” composed by Yuki Tsujimura and MEGMETAL, delivers an emotionally charged rock sound. “AISHITEYO,” by the same creative team, channels raw emotion and heightened drama, further brought to life in the music video released today.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The EP also features “Holy Brighters,” which portrays heroism that moves forward despite doubt and anxiety, “Not Philosophy,” which explores strength and love through emotion rather than words, and “Contact,” a soulful R&B-based track that affirms even pain and inner conflict.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>In addition, REIRIE will launch their nationwide tour, “REIRIE Live Tour 2026 -Amethyst-,” in February 2026. Spanning 12 cities, the tour will be the largest of the group’s career to date.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\thttps://youtu.be/sjNxaqgOwvo\r\n\r\n<h2>Product Information</h2>\r\n\t<b>EP Release</b>\r\nREIRIE Major 1st EP\r\nTitle: Amethyst\r\nRelease Date: January 28, 2026\r\n\r\n\t<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/REIRIE_Amethyst_Rei_JK.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>REI Edition</b>\r\nLAMR-35038 / ¥8,800 (incl. tax)\r\n\r\n\t<b>BD</b>\r\nREIRIE FreeLive “JAM” at Shinjuku Kabukicho LiveMovie\r\nBaD=DoLL MV Behind the Scenes ①\r\n\r\n\t<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/REIRIE_Amethyst_Rie_JK.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>RIE Edition</b>\r\nLAMR-35040 / ¥8,800 (incl. tax)\r\n\r\n\t<b>BD</b>\r\nREIRIE Live Tour 2025 -BaD=DoLL- at Shimokitazawa SHANGRILA LiveMovie\r\nBaD=DoLL MV Behind the Scenes ②\r\n\r\n\t<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/REIRIE_Amethyst_Nomal_JK-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Standard Edition</b>\r\nLAMR-5038 / ¥3,300 (incl. tax)\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Tracklist (all editions)</b>\r\n1.

Kirei ni Shitemoraemasu ka, also known as “Wash It All Away” in English adaptations, will begin airing January 5, 2026. The original work by popular manga artist Mitsuru Hattori is a heartwarming series that follows a cleaning service based in Atami, Japan.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>The opening theme song “Kirei.” is performed by up-and-coming singer Yuu., known for her powerful vocal abilities and expressive voice, who has become popular among teens and twenty-somethings with over 370,000 subscribers on YouTube. The song was written and composed by Vocaloid producer Jin, renowned for songs such as “Yobanashi Deceive” and “Summertime Record” and for providing music for numerous forms of content.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>Yuu.’s first CD release has also been announced. First edition copies and standard edition copies will be available. The first edition copies will come with a bonus Blu-ray disc. More details will be released at a later date. The standard edition bonus track will be produced by Takaaki Natsushiro, a popular Vocaloid producer, composer and artist known for hit tracks like “From Tokyo.” The first edition bonus track will be produced by popular creator NayutalieN, known for “Solar System Disco”, an addictive track with over 10 million views on YouTube.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>The ending theme song “Wakaba no Koro” is written and performed by songwriter and actress Natsumi Kiyoura. The heartfelt pop song was written through the eyes of the anime’s main character Wakana Kinme. Both the theme song and the additional bonus tracks were produced by Katsutoshi Kitagawa from Round Table, who has supported Kiyoura’s live performances throughout the years.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>Kiyoura’s latest artist photo has also been released!

(Singer for OP Theme Song “Kirei.”)</h2>\r\nI’m Yuu., nice to meet you!It’s an honor to perform the opening theme song. I’m very happy to be singing my very first anime theme song at 20 years old! I sang while imagining the beautiful sea of Atami and cherishing the human connections and feelings of warmth that are evident throughout this story. I hope you enjoy this anime while appreciating the heartwarming scenes and feelings it evokes.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t<h2>Comment From Jin (Writer and Composer for OP Theme Song “Kirei.”)</h2>\r\nThings that are clean, transparent, and tidy. Things that change shape over time. Things that are layered with stains and scratches that give them character. “Kirei” comes to mind. Such a word that is soaked in human emotion is the theme of this song.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Comment From Natsumi Kiyoura (Singer and Lyrics for ED Theme Song “Wakaba no Koro”)</h2>\r\nMy first impression of the original manga left me pondering Ms. Kinme’s dedication to her work and her kindness, as well as the dappling sunlight through the trees and seasons we see during our everyday life. “Wakaba no Koro” captures the feelings of early summer, fleeting moments of youth, and singular pages in the story of life. You can trust the ending theme song for this anime in my hands.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment From Katsutoshi Kitagawa (Producer for ED Theme Song “Wakaba no Koro”)</h2>\r\nHaving lived in Hakodate until high school, imagining life in a coastal town brought back memories. Like biking to the shore and spending the afternoon with a paperback book. I thought I’d like to make a song that is filled with the essence of the original work and my memories like the smell of a seaside town. I hope you can feel the softness of the acoustic guitar and string instruments and the warmth of the woodwinds.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>uct Information</h2>\r\nTV Anime Kirei ni Shitemoraemasu ka OP Theme Song “Kirei.” by Yuu.\r\nRelease Date: March 4, 2026\r\nFirst edition (CD and Blu-ray): VTZL-267 / 3,850 yen (tax in.)\r\nStandard edition (CD): VTCL-35392 / 1,430 yen (tax in.)\r\n\r\n\t<b>Tracklist</b>\r\nFirst edition\r\n1.

The new character Lada Priora will be voiced by voice actress and singer, Nonoka Obuchi, who also sings the ending theme song for the anime “Make it.” Nonoka Obuchi’s third single “Make it” is scheduled to be released February 25, 2026.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The new single will be released in three editions: the standard edition, anime edition, and a limited edition that comes with one of ten randomly chosen autographed polaroids and a photobook that came with her first and second singles. “Make it,” produced by emon(Tes.), is a gentle track with an upbeat sound that invites listeners to unwind. Check out a snippet of the new single in the latest teaser for the anime. The limited edition single will also come with a recording of Fuwari’s “SweetRoom823,” the theme song for Obuchi’s upcoming drama Fukukaicho no Omona Oshigoto, scheduled for January 2026.

If you worry about what you were born with or where you are currently, give this song a listen, take yourself by the hand and take it easy.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>emon(Tes.)’s comment</h2>\r\nThis song is my attempt at giving sound to the feelings of the characters and the atmosphere of the original work. Music builds on the emotions that are brought forth from a story, so I’d be happy if this song sits quietly in the heart of everyone who listens to it.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Release Information</h2>\r\nEasygoing Territory Defense by the Optimistic Lord ending theme song “Make it”\r\nArtist: Nonoka Obuchi\r\nRelease Date: February 25, 2026\r\n\r\n\t<b>Limited Edition</b>\r\nIncludes 1 CD, photobook, autographed polaroid\r\nVTZL-264: 3,300 yen (tax in.)\r\n\r\n\t<b>Anime Edition</b>\r\nIncludes 1 CD\r\nVTCL-35391: 1,420 yen (tax in.)\r\n\r\n\t<b>Standard Edition</b>\r\nIncludes 1 CD\r\nVTCL-35390: 1,430 yen (tax in.)\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Tracklist</h2>\r\n\t<b>Limited Edition</b>\r\n1.

Nowlu comes from the image of a lone owl spreading its wings toward the moon (or the world) at night.

That overlap made the title feel like a perfect fit.\r\n\t\t\t\r\nFlight usually carries a positive image of moving forward with determination, but I approached it from a different angle. The lyrics contain traces of irony toward those driven by revenge, as if saying “I’m above you.”\r\n\t\t\t\r\nThe words evoke a “quietly burning inner blue flame,” and the sharp, spicy piano lines give it a tingling edge, creating a sophisticated, cool house track. I hope listeners enjoy that interplay.\r\n\t\t\t\r\nEven if the story’s exhilarating moments leave you drained, I think this song will help you remember your purpose again and serve as the fuel that carries you to the next episode.\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n   \r\n\t<div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nYour new EP 'Dose' was released on September 1, 2025 and features six previously released songs and the brand-new title track of the same name.

It’s like a profile of the path I’ve walked so far.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n“Dose” is about a truly painful night in my life. I felt the fear and loneliness of being unnecessary, and the vague anxiety of wondering how long it would last, until it built up to the point where I could barely breathe. It was terrifying and agonizing.\r\n\t\t\t\r\nHumans tend to beautify memories, so eventually even this will fade and be forgotten. At the time, I wanted to forget it because it was so painful, but I also remembered the desperate notes I had scribbled during those days.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n“Dose” was actually the working title. It’s a word of resignation in Japanese, but it was this word that somehow pulled me out of that unbearable suffering. I decided to turn it into a song because I felt that the memory of that night, and the emotional outburst it carried, might offer comfort to someone else. \r\nEven though it’s a song born from despair, I also wanted people to feel the melody and move to it. So I focused on singing in a more danceable, groovy way than usual. I hope that comes through.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdZPNeEBTbo\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n   \r\n\t<div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nYour song “Stuck on you,” one of our favorites, achieved major streaming success overseas, especially in North America.

The piece blends nostalgic footage from Daoko’s everyday life with modern graphics, creating a warm, 2000s-inspired work that evokes brief flashes of memory.</li>\t\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/oTyn9eP8oGE\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Daoko’s Comment</h2>\r\nI put this song together by arranging my favorite words found in everyday life to match namitape’s exciting sound. While creating it, I pictured scenes from a walk, and with that image in mind, I wanted the music video to feel familiar and approachable, so I asked Director Saeki, with whom I have a close relationship and whom I deeply respect. The shoot was very enjoyable, with a calm, pleasant atmosphere throughout. The gentle expressions we captured during that warm, sunlit moment are closer to my natural self than what I’ve shown before, which makes me feel a little shy, but Director Saeki brought everything together beautifully, so I hope you enjoy it.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Yuichiro Saeki's Comment</h2>\r\nI hope you can enjoy Daoko’s expressions and gestures, which shine with a unique radiance while remaining true to herself, together with the world of the song.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Video Credits</h2>\r\nStarring: Daoko\r\nDirector: Yuichiro Saeki\r\nDirector of Photography: Ryuichi Taniura\r\nCamera Assistant: Kaoru Noguchi\r\nStylist: Mika Masuda\r\nHair & Makeup: Natsuho Makino\r\nLyric Design: Minoru Shimizu\r\nLocation Support: Chofu Film Commission\r\nProducer: Masato Kudo\r\nProduced by FAB\r\n\r\n\r\nA music video for the EP track “MeeM” is scheduled to be released on December 3.\r\n\r\nThe digital EP meta millefeuille, featuring “Rhythm in the Sunset” and “MeeM,” is available now. It includes five tracks in total, among them the July single “Zense wa Bushō” (arranged by Seiichi Nagai), the September single “Boku dake no Photon” (arranged by x0o0x_), and “Iiyo,” the opening theme for the TV anime Who Made Me a Princess, arranged by GuruConnect. The artwork is by rising illustrator Yu.\r\n\r\nUnder the theme of “kawaii,” the collection brings together a series of finely crafted pop tracks that showcase Daoko’s sharp, distinctive sensibility and her intimate connection to everyday life, marking her latest musical direction.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Release Information</h2>\r\nDaoko Digital EP meta millefeuille\r\nOut now!\r\nFind it on your favorite streaming service!\r\n<a href=\"http://lnk.to/meta_millefeuille\">lnk.to/meta_millefeuille</a>\r\n\r\n\t<b>Tracklist</b>\r\n1.

Marking their first arena performance in about three years and nine months since their 2022 Budokan show, the event was a special occasion for both the group and their fans. On this day, they surprised the audience with the first-ever live performance of their latest song “Liberator,” announced as the opening theme for the TV anime Roll Over and Die, set to begin airing in January 2026. They also revealed that the song will be released as a single on March 4, 2026.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>Published by Micro Magazine, Roll Over and Die is a dark fantasy story about the protagonist, Flum, who, despite having zero stats, is chosen by the God Origin to join the Hero’s Party and continues to push forward alongside newfound companions. PassCode’s opening theme “Liberator” can be heard in the anime’s newly released PV.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Alongside the single announcement, PassCode unveiled a new artist photo featuring the denim-based outfits worn at Yokohama BUNTAI. The fresh visual marks a shift from their previous images, showcasing a brighter, more pop-inspired style.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>It was also announced that the Yokohama BUNTAI concert will be exclusively streamed on U-NEXT, with the streaming start date to be revealed later via PassCode’s official social media. Leading up to that release, several past performances will be available for unlimited streaming: PassCode ASIA TOUR 2024 Final at Zepp Osaka Bayside on November 13, PassCode presents VERSUS PASSCODE 2024 Vol.2 at Spotify O-EAST on November 27, and PassCode Zephyren 10th Anniversary A.V.E.S.T project Kodo at Yoyogi National Stadium First Gymnasium on December 18.

The track “Ichikabachika” from their 2019 album CLARITY was selected as the opening theme for the TV drama Kakegurui season 2 and the movie Kakegurui. In 2020, their single “STARRY SKY,” which was chosen as the theme song for the drama 182 Days Left, earned them their first-ever No. 1 on the Oricon Weekly Single Chart and Billboard JAPAN Weekly Single Chart. They also made their debut appearance on Nippon Broadcasting System’s All Night Nippon 0.\r\n\r\nIn February 2022, they held their first concert at Nippon Budokan.

When in doubt, I went back to my roots: I listened to the first season’s opening, “future,” and adjusted the sound so the lows and mids would carry more weight, while the highs would highlight the richness and vibrancy of the artists’ and voice actors’ voices.\r\n\r\nI hope you’ll feel the same excitement as if you were actually at a Prince of Tennis Festival. Whether recording, mixing, or mastering, I always strive for the best balance and sound quality, and through this collaboration with AVIOT, I was reminded that sound can always keep evolving. Thank you!”\r\n\r\n\t<b>About UZA</b>\r\nUZA (Lyricist, Composer, Sound Producer, Singer-Songwriter)\r\nBorn in Tokyo on April 23, 1970.\r\n\r\nHe began his career in 1993 after participating in “BAD AUDITION,” organized by Being, and signed an exclusive songwriter contract with the company.

Rei Nakashima’s laid-back style and the fun-filled atmosphere of the track result in a relaxed and easygoing pop song. Its upbeat, cheery melody and Nakashima’s silky smooth vocals pair perfectly with the feel of the anime and will invite listeners to sit back and take a load off. A portion of the track was sampled in the latest promotional video for Easygoing Territory Defense by the Optimistic Lord that was released on October 19.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Rei Nakashima’s “Moshimo,” the theme song for her weekly Sunday night radio show “Kyou mo Hanamaru!” will be recorded on both the first editions and standard editions of the single as the coupling track. “Moshimo” was produced by Nakashima herself and remains her most popular track among fans. The first edition of the single will also include “Otona Atsukai,” an exclusive track that’s never been recorded on CD. It was written by Nakashima when she was in high school and produced in commemoration of her 20th birthday last year for online streaming. More track information will be released at a later date.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Release Information</h2>\r\nComing February 18, 2026\r\nRei Nakashima’s 3rd single “Okirakuze~shon”\r\n“Yoisho” first edition  (CD & Blu-ray): VTZL-263 / 4,400 yen (tax in.)\r\n“Nonbiri” standard edition (CD): VTCL-35389 / 1,540 yen (tax in.)\r\n\r\n\t<b>Bonus Feature</b>\r\nPhotoshoot “tREIding card” (random)\r\n*Included in the initial press of all first editions and standard editions.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Tracklist</h2>\r\n“Yoisho” first edition (CD & Blu-ray)\r\nM1.

I’d love to hear how this video, this world, looks to you.\r\n\r\nP.S. I secretly hid seven shrimp, Mekakushe’s favorite, somewhere in the video. See if you can find them!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Meyoco’s Comment</h2>\r\nIt’s an honor to create an artwork for mekakushe-san’s music. I had a lot of fun creating the illustration from beginning to end. I was given the chance to create the artwork according to my style, which I deeply appreciate. The main theme I wanted to cover is a combination of “time” and “space,” with the motif of the clock being a dominant element in the artwork alongside the girl. I wanted the artworks to look warm and peaceful, the way you would feel when remembering someone you love. I hope my illustrations could serve well as a companion to mekakushe-san’s music.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment from Kousuke Hayashi (Scenarioart)</h2>\r\nI arranged the song to evoke a sense of nostalgia in anyone’s heart. While working on it, I found comfort in how the music seemed to gently loosen the heart, like returning to a shared hometown.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Comment from Otsukimi</h2>\r\nI’m truly honored to have been asked to create the music video for “Space Gate.”\r\nI had a wonderful time illustrating a world inspired by the moon, the stars, and the cosmos. The rotating merry-go-round scene is especially dear to me. It came together through many rounds of brainstorming and careful fine-tuning. The reversal of its rotation between the first and second halves expresses the emotional shift of the girl in the story. I hope you enjoy this touch along with the beautiful song and lyrics.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Kousuke Hayashi’s Profile</h2>\r\nVocalist and guitarist for the rock band Scenarioart, Kosuke also works as a lyricist, composer, and arranger.\r\n\r\nX: <a href=\"http://x.com/kosukedao\">x.com/kosukedao</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Otsukimi’s Profile</h2>\r\nA Tokyo-based illustrator whose work centers on the theme of “softness with a touch of romance.” Known for designs featuring moon and star motifs that bring out the gentle charm of girls.\r\n\r\nX: <a href=\"http://x.com/otsukimi8\">x.com/otsukimi8</a>　\r\nInstagram: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/_o_tsukimi_\">instagram.com/_o_tsukimi_</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Mekakushe’s Profile</h2>\r\nHandling lyrics, composition, vocals, and piano performance by herself, the next-generation singer-songwriter Mekakushe enjoys immense popularity among artists and creators. Starting classical piano at the age of three, she gradually gravitated towards pop music. Her independently produced songs were featured in a Kao Laurier commercial, and she was one of the top artists on the Spotify official playlist “Kirakira Pop Japan” with a total of 3 million plays. She is a promising emerging artist with anticipated future success. With electronica as the foundation in her recordings, her musical style continues to expand, featuring classical solos and band sets in live performances.\r\n\r\nOfficial YouTube channel: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@_mekakushe_\">youtube.com/@_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_mekakushe_\">twitter.com/_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_mekakushe_\">instagram.com/_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial TikTok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@_mekakushe_\">tiktok.com/@_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial homepage: <a href=\"https://www.mekakushe.com\">mekakushe.com</a>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

From NARASAKI, who composed the music, and Matsui, who wrote the lyrics, I received a song of great importance. The moment I first heard the demo, I thought, “This is Ultraman.”\r\n\r\nI’ve been a huge fan of the Ultraman series since childhood, right up to now. For all six years of elementary school, I used to write letters to Ultraman. I would even get replies, and reading those letters was part of my childhood.\r\n\r\nThat’s why, with all my love for Ultraman, I put my heart into singing every single note, hoping to give courage to the children who will grow up watching Omega. Who knows, maybe among those kids, there will be someone who dreams of becoming a musician and one day sings a theme song like I did. I want to keep passing the baton into the future.\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nYou incorporated rap and lyrics into \"Missing Link,\" the ending theme with MindaRyn.

The new best album featuring theme songs and insert songs from the popular series will be going on sale November 26, 2025! The CD cover for both the first edition and standard edition albums will feature special illustrations by the author Koré Yamazaki.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The first disc will include all of the main theme songs from both seasons such as “Here”, “Cycle”, “Nemurasareta Lineage” and more! The second disc will include popular insert songs from the anime such as “Iruna Eteluro” and “Dance of the Spirit.” Tracks such as “Quiet Choir” and “Holiday” which will be recorded on CD for the very first time on this album. The main theme song from the recently released game The Ancient Magus’ Bride: Seika no Maboroshi to Yume Miru Tabiji “Sagashimono” will be featured as well.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>First editions will include a third disc featuring a collection of 15 tracks from the anime score selected by pianist Junichi Matsumoto, making the album a complete collection of music from the world of The Ancient Magus’ Bride.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>Ahead of the album’s release, voices of Chise (Atsumi Tanezaki) and Elias (Ryouta Takeuchi), JUNNA and Junichi Matsumoto gave a special comment.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment From Atsumi Tanezaki (Chise V.A.)</h2>\r\nCongratulations on the release of the new album The Ancient Magus’ Bride Complete Best! Every song plays a crucial role in the world of The Ancient Magus’ Bride. JUNNA’s “Here” pulls on my heartstrings as it takes me back to where it all began. I still remember humming “Hana Kazoe” like a lullaby during a recording session, trying to sing like Chise. I hope everyone immerses themselves once more into this magical world through this album. I know I will be. I can’t wait for its release...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment From Ryouta Takeuchi (Elias V.A.)</h2>\r\nThe soundtrack and music of The Ancient Magus’ Bride is so memorable, but the scene that stands out to me the most is from season 1 episode 12 when Chise finishes making her wand and returns to Elias using magic! For a scene with zero dialogue, it makes for a truly touching and beautiful scene, consisting of only the opening theme “Here” and the visuals! The music of this anime has a mysterious way of making emotions visible. I want everyone to revisit this story through this album!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment From JUNNA</h2>\r\nCongratulations on the new album. My first single as a singer was “Here,” so The Ancient Magus’ Bride truly is a work that allowed me to grow alongside it and encounter new things. As a fan of a series that’s loved by many, and as an artist, I’m looking forward to enjoying what’s to come.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment From Junichi Matsumoto</h2>\r\nCongratulations on the new album. It all came back to me...the scenes, the colors, the atmosphere, the air, the eyes, the expressions, the voices and the sounds... I’m happy to experience them all again through the music. I’ve carefully selected 15 tracks. I hope you enjoy this brief journey through the sounds of The Ancient Magus’ Bride.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Release Information</h2>\r\nNovember 26, 2025\r\nThe Ancient Magus’ Bride Complete Best\r\nFirst Edition (3 CDs + Booklet): VTZL-262/ 5,720 yen (tax in.)\r\nStandard Edition (2 CDs): VTCL-60653~60654/ 3,850 yen (tax in.)\r\n\r\n\t<b>Tracklist</b>\r\nDisc 1\r\nHere / JUNNA\r\nKan -cycle- / Hana Itoki\r\nYou / May’n\r\nTsuki no Mou Hanbun / AIKI & AKINO from bless4\r\nThe Legend of “The Ancient Magus’ Bride” / Jessica\r\nDear / JUNNA\r\nMubansou / edda\r\nNemurasareta Lineage / JUNNA\r\nFam / yuyu\r\nClockwork Quick and Lightning Slow / Julia Shortreed\r\nAuro nowe / inocencia\r\nSagashimono / reche\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\nLibero ala / Miu Sakamoto\r\nKimi no Yukue / KOCHO\r\nSeirei no Mai ~Dance of the Spirit~ / KOKIA\r\nAnno Domini / Hibiki Hojo\r\nIruna Eteluro / Daichi Takenaka\r\nRose / Kaco\r\nHana Kazoe / Akino Arai\r\nStory / Kotringo\r\nQuiet Choir / Akira Yamamoto\r\nHoliday / Sonoko Inoue\r\n\r\nDisc 3\r\n15-song soundtrack collection by Junichi Matsumoto.\r\n*Details coming soon\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Distribution Information</h2>\r\nPre-add/Pre-save link: <a href=\"http://jvcmusic.lnk.to/mahoyome_best_pre\">jvcmusic.lnk.to/mahoyome_best_pre</a>\r\nAvailable on streaming services and major download sites such as the iTunes Store, RecoChoku, and more, on Wednesday, November 26, 2025!\r\nStreaming services: Apple Music, LINE MUSIC, Amazon Music, Deezer, AWA, KKBOX, Rakuten Music, Spotify, YouTube Music.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial Anime Website: <a href=\"http://mahoyome.jp\">mahoyome.jp</a>\r\nOfficial Anime X Account (Twitter): <a href=\"http://x.com/mahoyomeproject\">x.com/mahoyomeproject</a>\r\nOfficial Anime Instagram: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/mahoyomeproject\">instagram.com/mahoyomeproject</a>\r\nOfficial Game Website: <a href=\"http://mahoyome.bushiroadgames.com\">mahoyome.bushiroadgames.com</a>\r\nOfficial Game X Account (Twitter): <a href=\"http://x.com/mahonatsu_game\">x.com/mahonatsu_game\t</a>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

Written and composed by mekakushe and arranged by Sondai Nishijima, the song is a two-step track that condenses three minutes of technical beats, as if the universe itself were trapped inside a snow globe. The jacket art and music video were created by collage artist kyabeshi.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The jacket art for 138 Oku-nen Me no Koi has also been revealed. It was created by Southeast Asia–based illustrator Meyoco, an Instagram influencer with over 1.17 million followers who also runs her own apparel line. In addition to the main artwork, she drew complementary illustrations, which will appear on acrylic panels distributed as special gifts for the 1st and 2nd stages of mekakushe Planetarium Acoustic Live ~138 Oku-nen Me no Koi~ on November 27.</li>\r\n\r\n\thttps://youtu.be/pDI2RVFDg78\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Product Information</h2>\r\nTrack Title: “Snow Globe Galaxy”\r\nLyrics/Composition: mekakushe　\r\nArrangement: Sondai Nishijima\r\nJacket Art: Kyabeshi\r\n\r\nOn streaming websites: <a href=\"http://linkco.re/5TdgzZRr\">linkco.re/5TdgzZRr</a>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mekakushe’s Comment</h2>\r\nSnow globes are beautiful and lonely, holding beginnings and endings, a fleeting eternity trapped inside. When I was little, I loved gazing at them. An infinite world fit in the palm of my hand, self-contained, compressed into a single space, and it made my heart race. Music feels the same. It ends eventually, but for a moment, it becomes my own small, enclosed world of beauty. This song is like a snow globe you can listen to, three minutes capturing beginnings and endings, beauty and loneliness, all in one.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Sondai Nishijima’s Comment</h2>\r\n“Snow Globe Galaxy” is the wild card of the album, packed with surprises in its short runtime. Its signature lies in rollercoaster-like twists and technical beats. I asked Mekakushe to tackle many challenging harmonies and choruses (sorry!), and she sang beautifully, bringing to life a one-of-a-kind snow globe. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Kyabeshi’s Comment</h2>\r\nJust like you see different scenes when you flip a snow globe, we’ve packed a variety of scenes into this music video. I’d love to hear how this video, this world, looks to you.\r\n\r\nP.S. I secretly hid seven shrimp, Mekakushe’s favorite, somewhere in the video. See if you can find them!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Meyoco’s Comment</h2>\r\nIt’s an honor to create an artwork for mekakushe-san’s music. I had a lot of fun creating the illustration from beginning to end. I was given the chance to create the artwork according to my style, which I deeply appreciate. The main theme I wanted to cover is a combination of “time” and “space,” with the motif of the clock being a dominant element in the artwork alongside the girl. I wanted the artworks to look warm and peaceful, the way you would feel when remembering someone you love. I hope my illustrations could serve well as a companion to mekakushe-san’s music.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>138-Oku Nen Me no Koi Tracklist</h2>\r\nRetronym of Love (ED theme of Kowloon Generic Romance)\r\nZutto Emerald\r\nKimi wa Snorkel\r\nMy Own Polaris (insert song from Kowloon Generic Romance)\r\nYuwanamerou (insert song from Kowloon Generic Romance)\r\nSky Above\r\nRendezvous\r\nSnow Globe Galaxy\r\nAnd other new songs\r\n\r\n*Tracklist subject to change.

Based on the TE-Q3, this special edition features an original design inspired by the anime and newly recorded voice lines from Maomao and Jinshi.</li>\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Product Characteristics</h2>\r\n\t<b>Base Model</b>\r\nThis collaboration model is based on the TE-Q3, the latest entry in AVIOT’s Q Series, which has shipped approximately 320,000 units*1. Despite being one of the most compact active noise canceling earbuds on the market*2, the TE-Q3 offers up to 11.5 hours of playback on a single charge and up to 42 hours with the charging case. The ear tips are made from skin-friendly, medical-grade silicone*3. In addition to its robust core features, the TE-Q3 is equipped with 10 mm dynamic drivers for high-quality audio, making it a well-balanced model that excels in design, usability, and sound.\r\n\r\n*1 As of April 2025\r\n*2 Based on the combined dimensions of all three sides of the charging case for true wireless earbuds with ANC\r\n*3 Use of medical-grade silicone does not guarantee the absence of allergic reactions in all individuals\r\n\r\n\t<b>Special Voice Lines</b>\r\nThe earbuds include 76 newly recorded voice lines, featuring both guidance for power and connection notifications and a “random voice” feature with quotes from the anime. In addition to separate Maomao and Jinshi modes, there’s also a combined Maomao & Jinshi mode where the two characters interact, letting you enjoy their charming back-and-forth, just like in the anime.\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Special Design</b>\r\nThe earbuds and charging case feature an elegant olive green and gold color scheme that exudes a premium feel. The logo, inspired by medicinal herbs, subtly captures the world of The Apothecary Diaries. \r\n\r\nThe multi-layer coating and rubber finish add a sophisticated touch, making the design both stylish and practical for everyday use.\r\n\t\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BFS_PRS-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Special Packaging</b>\r\nThe packaging features motifs inspired by The Apothecary Diaries and a premium finish that includes a foil-stamped original logo.

I’m so glad I finally realized it.\r\nEnough to wipe away everything that came before.”\r\nI’m honestly amazed that a day has come when I truly want to write lyrics full of hope like this.\r\nThat’s the symbolic meaning of an emerald.\r\nThe 1/f fluctuation—since water and music are alike, they’re both cold and warm at the same time.\r\nTomggg arranged the sound to make it feel that way.\r\nIt’s a secret that this song continues the story of “Kimi wa Snorkel.”\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Tomggg’s Comment</h2>\r\nWith “Kimi wa Snorkel,” the music felt like floating and diving underwater. In this new song, “Zutto Emerald,”  you can imagine happily floating and swimming around with cute floaties. I hope the music captures the feeling of a pool of happiness and the unique sparkle of emerald, expressing all kinds of light through sound.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Yuki Nanami’s Comment</h2>\r\nFrom the moment I first heard it, images of being gently rocked by emerald water and floating softly in space came to mind, sparking a flood of ideas that made creating the illustrations very enjoyable.\r\nIt’s a soft, happy song, but with a hint of sadness that makes you want to listen to it again and again. I’m very happy to be involved in the music video. It’s been a wonderful experience!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Tomggg’s Profile</h2>\r\nA prolific arranger who has collaborated on projects with all kinds of artists within Japan and abroad, such as Kaho Nakamura, Chelmico, Haruno, Harmoe, Daoko, Shelheil, and Ena Mori, to name a few. His reach has since gotten even wider with the release of “Nante ne” in a recent commercial for Pokari Sweat.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Yuki Nanami’s Profile </h2>\r\nA pixel artist who mainly draws girls and landscapes, known for a style that captures everyday moments with a nostalgic atmosphere. She has created many video works, including music videos with looped animations, and collaborates with companies to produce and sell apparel and merchandise.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Mekakushe’s Profile</h2>\r\nHandling lyrics, composition, vocals, and piano performance by herself, the next-generation singer-songwriter Mekakushe enjoys immense popularity among artists and creators. Starting classical piano at the age of three, she gradually gravitated towards pop music.

With the revival, HypMovie has finally surpassed the major milestone of 2 billion yen in box office revenue.</li> \r\n\r\n\t<li>HypMovie is Japan's \"first\" interactive movie and made its screen debut on February 21st, 2025 at 85 theaters in Japan. Due to the limited amount of interactive screening equipment, the movie continued its run at a limited number of 60 to 80 theaters in Japan. While there have been many movies in the past that started with small-scale releases of around 10 theaters, gained popularity and expanded to over 150 theaters to become major hits, HypMovie has become the first movie in Japan to surpass a box office revenue of 2 billion yen with fewer than 100 theaters from its opening day. (Source: Kogyo Tsushinsha)</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>One of the reasons the movie has been such a hit is due to its interactive nature, the first of its kind in Japan, and which plays a central role in the viewing experience. The outcome of each rap battle unfolding on the screen is decided by the audience via a specialized voting system carried out via smartphone. Viewers vote during the movie a total of 5 times to determine the winner of each battle, which means there are a total of 48 different ways the movie can play out and 7 different endings.</li>\r\n　\r\n\t<li>Furthermore, to commemorate the movie's success, the specially-produced video \"Claim Victory (Immersive Edition)\"—which is being shown at the \"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" exhibition currently in Nagoya—has been uploaded to the official Hypnosis Mic YouTube channel for a limited time.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The video encapsulates the intensity of the final Division Rap Battle during the movie and is a must-see for any HypMic fan. It will only be available until September 7th 23:59 JST, so don't miss it.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>The battle continues in theaters where HypMovie continues to be shown, and audiences in Japan have the opportunity to get their hands on some limited bonus items. As the 11th round of bonuses, “clear cards” featuring new illustrations by the Hypnosis Mic character designer Kazui will be given out to moviegoers. 2 sets of 3 designs will be randomly distributed, the first of which is Buster Bros!!!/MAD TRIGGER CREW/Fling Posse, which will be given out until September 12th, followed by the Matenro/DOTSUITARE-HOMPO/Bad Ass Temple version from September 13th until September 19th. Both are exclusive to theaters, so if you're in the area, be sure to check out the revival screenings. For theater details, check the dedicated webpage \"NOVELTY\" on the official HypMovie website.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Additionally, part of the latest round of live HypMic events featuring HypMic cast members \"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle- 11th LIVE <Final D.R.B.>\" (hereafter referred to as 11th Live), will be livestreamed in theaters in Japan alongside HypMovie. These special \"Live Viewing\" screenings will include a live broadcast of part of the stage performances before the movie screening, and will include the opening greeting from the cast on-stage.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>Tickets for Fling Posse & Matenro's performance on September 6th are currently on sale. Tickets for MAD TRIGGER CREW & DOTSUITARE-HOMPO's performance on September 20th go on sale on September 13th, and tickets for Buster Bros!!! & Bad Ass Temple's October 4th performance goes on sale on September 27th. Check the official HypMovie website for information regarding participating theaters. </li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>All 6 of the 11th Live performances will be livestreamed by ABEMA exclusively on their “Abema PPV” platform, with tickets currently on sale. In addition to the standard ticket which will stream footage from the main camera only, a special “multi-angle” ticket is also on sale, which allows you to freely choose between the “upper camera”, “lower camera” and “full-view camera” during the stream. PPV viewers can also enjoy special bonus content: an “I’m Home” video of the cast members recorded right after the performance, where they will talk to the camera about their thoughts and feelings directly after the show. All 6 performances can only be watched in their entirety on “Abema PPV”, so don’t miss out!</li>\r\n\r\n\thttps://youtu.be/wIhsuSUvOyQ\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>HypMovie \"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" special site: NOVELTY</h2>\r\n\tLink: <a href=\"https://hypnosismic-movie.com/novelty\">hypnosismic-movie.com/novelty</a>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>“Abema PPV” livestream/ticket purchase page</h2>\r\nFling Posse & Matenro: <a href=\"http://abema.go.link/dv05N\">abema.go.link/dv05N</a>\r\nMAD TRIGGER CREW & DOTSUITARE-HOMPO: <a href=\"http://abema.go.link/98uOH\">abema.go.link/98uOH</a>\r\nBuster Bros!!! & Bad Ass Temple: <a href=\"http://abema.go.link/13rPT\">abema.go.link/13rPT</a>\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>HypMovie \"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" 11th LIVE [Final D.R.B] Stage Greeting \"Live Viewing\" Broadcast</h2>\t\r\nSeptember 6th, 17:45 showing (before movie screening)\r\nHypMovie \"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" 11th LIVE [Final D.R.B] Fling Posse & Matenro opening greeting \"Live Viewing\" Broadcast \r\n\r\nTickets on sale at theaters across Japan\r\n(Ticket sales may have ended at some theaters.)\r\n\r\nSeptember 20th, 17:40 showing (before movie screening)\r\nHypMovie \"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" 11th LIVE [Final D.R.B] MAD TRIGGER CREW & DOTSUITARE-HOMPO opening greeting \"Live Viewing\" Broadcast \r\n\r\nTicket sale start date: September 13th 0:00 JST\r\n\r\nOctober 10th, 17:40 showing (before movie screening)\r\nHypMovie \"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" 11th LIVE [Final D.R.B] Buster Bros!!! & Bad Ass Temple opening greeting \"Live Viewing\" Broadcast \r\nTicket sale start date: September 27th 0:00 JST\r\n\r\n\t<h2>\"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" 11th LIVE [Final D.R.B]</h2>\t\r\n\t\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HypMic11thLive_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\r\n\r\n\t<b>Event Schedule/Venue/Performer Information</b>\r\nSeptember 6th, 2025 | Doors: 16:00 / Start: 17:00\r\nSeptember 7th, 2025 | Doors: 15:00 / Start: 16:00\r\n\"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" 11th LIVE [Final D.R.B] Fling Posse & Matenro\r\nVenue: Keio Arena TOKYO (Musashino Forest Sports Plaza)\r\nPerformers: Yusuke Shirai, Soma Saito, Yukihiro Nozuyama, Sho Hayami, Ryuichi Kijima, Kento Ito\r\n\r\nSeptember 20th, 2025 | Doors: 16:00 / Start: 17:00\r\nSeptember 21st, 2025 | Doors: 15:00 / Start: 16:00\r\n\"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" 11th LIVE [Final D.R.B] MAD TRIGGER CREW & DOTSUITARE-HOMPO\r\nVenue: Nihon Kogakuin Arena\r\nPerformers: Shintaro Asanuma, Wataru Komada, Shinichiro Kamio, Ryota Iwasaki, Kengo Kawanishi, Takaya Kuroda\r\n\r\nOctober 4th, 2025 | Doors: 16:00 / Start: 17:00\r\nOctober 5th, 2025 | Doors: 16:00 / Start: 17:00\r\n\"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" 11th LIVE [Final D.R.B] Buster Bros!!! & Bad Ass Temple\r\nVenue: Nihon Kogakuin Arena\r\nPerformers: Subaru Kimura, Haruki Ishiya, Kohei Amasaki, Shota Hayama, Yuki Sakakihara, Eiji Takeuchi\r\n\r\n\t<b>Ticket Price</b>\r\nAllocated seating: 12,000 JPY (incl. tax)\r\n(Tickets required for children 6+; under 6s are not permitted)\r\n(Refunds will not be permitted in the event of a change in performers or event content.)\r\n(Up to 2 tickets per person may be purchased.)\r\n(Ticket resale or auction is strictly prohibited.

Each character's voice actor performs all their own songs, and so each character's story develops through the music.\r\n\r\nThe world of Hypnosis Mic has been explored across a range of media, including manga, video games, stage plays, anime and more, all based on its strongly characteristic music and narrative audio dramas.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>What’s the MOVIE?</h2>\r\n\"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle-\" is Japan's \"first\" audience-participation style interactive movie.\r\n \r\nThe outcome of each rap battle unfolding on the screen is decided by the audience vote. Voting is conducted in real-time through the smartphone app \"CtrlMovie\" system by Kino Industries, and the story progresses based on the outcome of these votes.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s story and ending shift with each screening depending on the choices of each audience member, making each screening unique...\r\nThe first-ever interactive movie experience in the history of Japanese cinema.\r\n\r\n\t<b>Introducing Interactive Movie System \"CtrlMovie\"</b>\r\nHypMovie's interactive aspects are brought to you by \"CtrlMovie\", an interactive movie system by Kino Industries.\r\nDownload \"CtrlMovie\" to your smartphone from the App Store or Google Play and enjoy Japan's very first interactive movie experience.\r\n\r\n\t<b>Download \"CtrlMovie\"</b>\r\nApp Store:\r\n<a href=\"http://apps.apple.com/app/ctrlmovie/id1069306593\">apps.apple.com/app/ctrlmovie/id1069306593</a>\r\n\r\nGoogle Play:\r\n<a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctrl.cinemaapp\">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctrl.cinemaapp</a>\r\n\r\n\t<b>Cast</b>\r\nBuster Bros!!!\r\nIchiro Yamada: Subaru Kimura\r\nJiro Yamada: Haruki Ishiya\r\nSaburo Yamada: Kohei Amasaki\r\n\r\nMAD TRIGGER CREW\r\nSamatoki Aohitsugi: Shintaro Asanuma\r\nIruma Jyuto: Wataru Komada\r\nRio Mason Busujima: Shinichiro Kamio\r\n\r\nFling Posse\r\nRamuda Amemura: Yusuke Shirai\r\nYumeno Gentaro: Soma Saito\r\nDice Arisugawa: Yukihiro Nozuyama\r\n\r\nMatenro\r\nJakurai Jinguji: Sho Hayami\r\nHifumi Izanami: Ryuichi Kijima\r\nDoppo Kannonzaka: Kento Ito\r\n\r\nDOTSUITARE-HOMPO\r\nSasara Nurude: Ryota Iwasaki\r\nRosho Tsutsujimori: Kengo Kawanishi\r\nRei Amayado: Takaya Kuroda\r\n\r\nBad Ass Temple\r\nKuko Harai: Shota Hayama\r\nJyushi Aimono: Yuki Sakakihara\r\nHitoya Amaguni: Eiji Takeuchi\r\n\r\nParty of Words\r\nOtome Touhoten: Yuu Kobayashi\r\nIchijiku Kadenokoji: Chiaki Takahashi\r\nNemu Aohitsugi: Nozomi Yamamoto \r\n\r\n\t<b>Staff</b>\r\nOriginal Work & Music Production: EVIL LINE RECORDS\r\nOriginal Character Design & Setting Design: EVIL LINE RECORDS, Yuichiro Momose\r\nDirector: Takanori Tsujimoto\r\nScript: Yuichiro Momose\r\nCharacter Design: Kazui\r\nAnimation Production: Polygon Pictures\r\nDistribution: TOHO NEXT\r\nProduction: Hypnosis Mic -Division Rap Battle- Movie Production Committee\r\n\t\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

This news comes weeks after it was announced that her single “Tooryanse” was chosen as the opening theme song. It will be released November 5th on the same CD as the new single. In addition, there will be a special live stream Friday, August 29th at 9PM (JST) to celebrate!</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The song was written and composed by hit-maker Masayoshi Oishi. This upbeat pop song with a Japanese twist that stays true to the lively and unique world of Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi, where supernatural beings and humans dwell together and explore themes such as “connection” and “belonging.” On the other hand, the ending theme song explores the main character, Aoi Tsubaki’s feelings towards her Odanna in a warm and heartfelt ballad by Tota Kasamura (LIVE LAB).</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Additionally, a new photo of Nao Toyama pays homage to the original photo used during the initial announcement of Toyama’s tie-in with the anime seven years ago. While the photo evokes memories of the past, Nao appears to embody “maturity” and “change.” </li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Limited first edition copies of the single will include select recordings from Nao Toyama’s solo live concert “Watashi no Kangaeta Muteki na Setlist!” on Blu-Ray. These valuable recordings were chosen by Nao Toyama herself for the single. The limited anime edition will include an original illustrated CD cover and a special variety program “Nao’s Kitchen” featuring Nao Toyama recreating the dishes served in Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi: Ni as well.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Don’t miss out on these charming theme songs and spectacular extras included in the gorgeous new single!</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Release Information</h2>\r\nNovember 5, 2025\r\n\r\nLimited First Edition: VTZL-257\r\nCD and Blu-ray: 3,740 yen (tax incl.)\r\n\r\nLimited Anime Edition: VTZL-258\r\nCD and DVD: 2,860 yen (tax incl.)\r\n\r\nStandard Edition: VTCL-35388\r\nCD only: 1,540 (tax incl.) \r\n\r\n\t<b>“Tooryanse” Special Live Stream!</b>\r\nURL：<a href=\"https://youtube.com/live/FjGjkUgtQaE\">youtube.com/live/FjGjkUgtQaE</a>\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Track List</h2>\r\n\t<b>Limited First Edition</b>\r\n1.

Every year, we have to wait till Anime NYC arrives again and begin to prepare. We grab our notepads, think about how to tackle all that’s within the convention halls, and ready our wallets to be emptied by the merchandise we’ll buy and the food we’ll devour! It’s hard not to feel like, when this convention finally starts, it’s over in the blink of an eye...\r\n\r\nThat being said, we attended 4 days of Anime NYC 2025 and had quite a few experiences, some good and others bad, and that’s why we once more present to you all our post-show field report to entertain you!

There were plenty of booths, from VTUBERS such as Hololive, where fans of various VTUBERs could join together, sing with them, listen to their randomness, and just enjoy a dedicated gaming hall where various tournaments were being held, like Tekken 8, Street Fighter 6, and even Super Smash Bros! Famous YouTubers like IronMouse and CDAWG VA were there too (sadly, we couldn’t watch them due to time constraints), and that was pretty neat!\r\n\r\nThere were also a slew of popular voice actors out there for meetups, interviews, and fan questions. Needless to say, this Anime NYC was without a doubt the most varied one to date. Regardless of what type of otaku you are, Anime NYC 2025 had you covered!\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of booths this year, ensuring a bit more variety than past outings. There was the Hololive stage, where fans of various VTUBERs could join their favorites, sing with them—they performed numerous anime and popular English songs—listen to them talk about silly topics, and even join in as if they were part of the group! Almost every day, Hololive was the loudest event by far, showing just how passionate those fans are.\r\n\r\nThose who wanted a more typical anime con affair could scour the floors for merchandise from numerous vendors, like Yen Press, Good Smile Company, Viz Media, and plenty of others. But with how pricey Anime NYC 2025 was, this certainly would stretch your savings a bit. We’d be lying if we didn’t admit we got a ton of figures ourselves, but it was well worth it to show our support to our favorite vendors.\r\n\r\nGaming otaku weren’t left in the dark at Anime NYC 2025! There was a big emphasis on games this year, with an entire floor dedicated to hosting gaming events. Con-goers could play against others in their favorite fighting games like Tekken 8, Street Fighter 6, and even Super Smash Bros! There were also card game tables for all the favorites, like Magic the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and so on. We even heard that some popular YouTubers like IronMouse and CDawgVA were playing games with the crowd! Due to time constraints, we couldn’t see them ourselves, but from the fan roars, we know they were enjoying the event!\r\n\r\nLastly, there were quite a few panels and voice actor meetups available! Famous voice talent like Kaiji Tang, Christopher Sabat, Aleks Le, AMALEE, and others were there to talk to con-goers, sign merch, or take photos! There were also plenty of panels where con-goers could learn more about numerous industry themes and/or upcoming projects. It would be impossible to see and experience everything in one day, let alone four, but at the very least, you couldn’t say there was nothing to do at Anime NYC 2025! \r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n<!-- /.wrap-unit -->\t\r\n\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000047650-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\t\r\n\r\n<h2>What Anime NYC 2025 Could Have Done Slightly Better</h2>\r\n  <div class=\"wrap-paragraph mt30\">\r\n    <p>\r\nUnfortunately, Anime NYC 2025 wasn’t without its drawbacks. The first—and most glaring—was overcrowding. We here at Honey’s Anime have been to our fair share of conventions, large and small, and Anime NYC 2025 is a medium-sized one compared to the titan that is Anime Expo. Nevertheless, it was clear that there was either no limit on how many could attend or a false expectation of how many would show up. Lines affected almost everything at the con, from food stalls and vendors to meeting some of the guests. The lines for food stalls were so long at times that they spilled into the non-food vendor areas, which was just terrible. Equally, seeing some of the guests was a nightmare, as lines could go on so long that it would be either impossible to meet them—unless you were there early enough—or by the time you worked your way up to the guest, they were on break or done with their time slot. Seriously, Anime NYC 2026 needs to consider capping ticket amounts or opening more of the Javits Center so there’s more room.\r\n\r\nAnother issue was the lack of big gaming vendors. Despite scouring the floor, we really only saw a few minor ones. Don’t get us wrong—we were more than thrilled to see Honor of Kings with their Detective Conan collaboration and Kaiju No.8, which we could play briefly—it looks and plays incredibly well for a mobile/Steam game. Yet, we were expecting some bigger gaming panels, maybe from Capcom or even SEGA. We get that this is an anime convention, but it does have a lot of gamers who attend, and we would have liked some more gaming content.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n<!-- /.wrap-unit -->\r\n\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000047610-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\t\r\n\r\n<h2>Cosplay Was Amazing, Once Again</h2>\r\n  <div class=\"wrap-paragraph mt30\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAs you can see, there was a lot of cosplay, but we always try to look for the more unique ones. In our gallery, there are the usual cosplayers, but we are very happy to include some funny and stylish ones from Anime NYC 2025! All cosplayers who had individual photos taken were asked for permission beforehand, so thank you all for posing for Honey’s Anime!

In our opinion, more people attending shows a greater appreciation for the convention, which is wonderful—but it also means that more of the Javits Center should be opened to help remedy the crowd. All things considered, we had a great time and would love to thank Anime NYC 2025 for allowing us the privilege to attend as press once again! We hope to see you all at Anime NYC 2026, which will no doubt happen after the success of this year!

Two people are caught in the midst of them, fighting to find a place for themselves. For Maribell Schuzen, stumbling upon the Grimoire of Lies meant being labeled as a Witch, a follower of the slain Demon Lord and enemy of the entire world. For Snazzy-chan, a popular streamer and otaku extraordinaire, a new fate has him wrapped up with tentacles. Tentacles, you say? Why, Snazzy is now a jellyfish of all things!\r\n\r\n“But don’t worry, Snazzy is a gentlemanly jellyfish!”\r\n\r\nSwearing to protect Maribell with all that his little body can do, Snazzy will show the world that keeping a Witch wrapped up is preferable to a dead Witch!\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Check out the novel here:</b>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.honeyfeed.fm/novels/3120\">honeyfeed.fm/novels/3120</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About KADOKAWA CORPORATION</h2>\r\n\tKADOKAWA Group, a comprehensive entertainment company, develops a wide range of businesses such as Publication, Animation, Film, Gaming, Web services, and Education/EdTech.

The anime premieres in Japan on October 3, 2025, with exclusive worldwide streaming on Prime Video beginning October 4 at 2:53 a.m.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Today, the main visual and full promotional video were released. The main visual depicts Daikoku Welfare Academy, where protagonist Sanda and his classmates study, with school principal Hifumi Oshibu—who exerts extreme control over the children—looming in the background. Santa Claus dramatically bursts through glass, symbolizing hope in a bleak future.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The reveal also introduces key characters and cast: Toshihiko Seki voices 92-year-old principal Oshibu, who obsessively clings to youth through repeated full-body plastic surgery, and Hiroaki Hirata plays Saburo Yagiuda, ace of the St. Nick Pursuit Unit dedicated to capturing Santa. Comments from both voice actors are included below.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The promotional video, showcasing Science SARU’s dynamic animation, portrays a world where children are tightly controlled and Santa is freed from a curse through wishes. It also features the first voice lines from the newly revealed characters Oshibu and Yagiuda.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The opening and ending themes have also been announced. The opening theme, “Childlike Adults,” is by yama, and the ending theme, “Diary,” is by Soushi Sakiyama. Comments from both artists are included below.\r\n<li>\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/PG9F1afLT-Y\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>New Characters and Voice Cast Revealed, with Comments!</h2>\r\n\t\t<h3>Hifumi Oshibu (Voiced by Toshihiko Seki)</h3>\r\nThe 92-year-old principal of Daikoku Welfare Academy, where Sanda and his classmates study. Obsessed with youth, he repeatedly undergoes full-body plastic surgery. He has an extreme dislike of adults and goes to abnormal lengths to protect and monitor his students’ every move.\r\n\r\n\t\t<b>Comment</b>\r\n1. How did you feel when you were cast as Oshibu in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?\r\nOf all Paru Itagaki’s works, SANDA was one I was especially interested in. And among her many characters, Hifumi Oshibu’s personality stands out. I approached the role with a fresh mindset to fully capture his unique presence. Please look forward to it!\r\n\r\n2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?\r\nIf Santa Claus were like the one in this series, every Christmas would be far more exciting! But if a real Santa Claus existed, I think I’d ask him to promise a future where children everywhere can live in safety.\r\n\r\n\t\t<b>Profile</b>\r\nBorn: Tochigi Prefecture\r\nMajor roles: Muzan Kibutsuji in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Medama Oyaji in Birth of Kitaro: The Mystery of GeGeGe, and Hansuke Doi in Nintama Rantaro\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Saburo Yagiuda (Voiced by Hiroaki Hirata)</h3>\r\nThe ace of the St. Nick Pursuit Unit dedicated to capturing Santa. Twenty years ago, he inflicted a serious injury on Santa Claus.\r\n\r\n\t\t<b>Comment</b>\r\n1. How did you feel when you were cast as Yagiuda in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?\r\nAlthough my character only appears partway through the story, I was warmly welcomed and had a great time recording. These days, there aren’t many productions where we go out drinking after recording, but with this one, everyone’s a heavy drinker, and I got dragged out until late at night every time. I’m counting on you, Murase!\r\n\r\n2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?\r\nAlthough I’m over 60, I’m still full of worldly desires. I think I’d ask Santa to help me become the kind of person who can say, “I have nothing more to wish for.”\r\n\r\n\t\t<b>Profile</b>\r\nBorn: August 7, 1963, Tokyo\r\nMajor roles: Sanji in ONE PIECE, Sha Gojyo in Saiyuki, and Beryl Gardenant in From Old Country Bumpkin to Master Swordsman\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<h2>Opening Theme Song</h2>\r\n“Childlike Adults” by yama (Sony Music Labels Inc.)\r\n\r\n\t\t<h2>Comment from yama</h2>　　　\r\nWhat does it mean to be an adult? Simply growing older does not necessarily make you one. Likewise, I do not believe that being young automatically makes someone a child.\r\nSilently carrying pain is both weakness and fragility, and facing it alone might be a clumsy way of avoiding reality.\r\nI once thought there was virtue in growing older while holding onto that fragility. But in recent years, whether with people close to me or through music, I have gradually begun to open my heart.\r\nThe line between myself and others has not changed, yet through connecting with others I discover new sides of myself. I do not think of myself as either an adult or a child, but rather believe that people possess both qualities at any age.\r\nIt is not about clinging to one side or deciding what is right or wrong. I have simply realized that I want to trust someone, and that is also a way of trusting myself.\r\nTo anyone else who feels caught between the two, I hope this reaches you.\r\n\r\n\t\t<h2>Ending Theme Song</h2>\r\n“Diary” by Soushi Sakiyama (Sony Music Labels Inc.)\r\n\r\n\t\t<h2>Comment from Soushi Sakiyama</h2>\r\nI’m honored to perform the ending theme. I felt a deep connection to Kazushige’s inner struggle, caught between adulthood and childhood, and I poured those emotions into the song. In a world without clear answers, where each person’s idea of justice collides, the way Kazushige moves forward with so many voices in his heart has moved me time and again. I hope you enjoy the song together with the anime.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<h2>TV Anime SANDA Overview</h2>\r\nBroadcast begins October 3, 2025 in Japan\r\nOfficial X (formerly Twitter): <a href=\"https://x.com/sanda_anime\">x.com/sanda_anime</a>\r\nOfficial website: <a href=\"https://sanda.red\">sanda.red</a>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Cast</h3>\r\nKazushige Sanda: Ayumu Murase\r\nSanta Claus: Hiroki Touchi\r\nShiori Fuyumura: Umeka Shoji\r\nIchie Ono: Anna Nagase\r\nHitoshi Amaya: Yuuki Shin\r\nNico Kazao: Misato Matsuoka\r\nHifumi Oshibu: Toshihiko Seki\r\nSaburo Yagiuda: Hiroaki Hirata\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Staff</h3>\r\nOriginal: “SANDA” by Paru Itagaki (Akita Shoten / Shonen Champion Comics)\r\nDirector: Tomohisa Shimoyama\r\nScript: Kimiko Ueno\r\nMusic: Tomoyuki Tanaka (FPM)\r\nCharacter Design & Chief Animation Director: Masamichi Ishiyama\r\nArt Director: Miki Higaki\r\nColor Design: Saori Goda\r\nCompositing Director: Hikari Itoh\r\nEditor: Kiyoshi Hirose\r\nSound Director: Keiichiro Miyoshi\r\nAnimation Production: Science SARU\r\n\r\nOpening Theme song: “Childlike Adults” by yama\r\nEnding Thema song: “Diary” by Soushi Sakiyama\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Original Manga</h2>\r\nVolumes 1 through 16 of Paru Itagaki’s SANDA (published by Akita Shoten under the Shonen Champion Comics label) are now on sale!\t\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

The song was written and composed by hit-maker Masayoshi Oishi. This upbeat pop song with a Japanese twist that stays true to the lively and unique world of Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi, where supernatural beings and humans dwell together and explore themes such as “connection” and “belonging.”</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Limited first edition copies of the single will include select recordings from Nao Toyama’s solo live concert “Watashi no Kangaeta Muteki na Setlist!” These valuable recordings were chosen by Nao Toyama herself for the single. The limited anime edition will include an original illustrated CD cover and a special variety program featuring Nao Toyama recreating the dishes served in Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi: Ni as well.\r\nDon’t miss out on this charming opening theme song and gorgeous single!\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Nao Toyama’s Comment</h2>\r\nIt was my pleasure to sing the theme song “Tooryanse” for the sequel of Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi. Thank you! Seven years ago, “Tomoshibi no Manimani” became one of my signature songs and a frequent number during my live concerts, still loved by fans until this day. Masayoshi Oishi’s killer track “Tooryanse” captures the bizarre and lively feeling of living alongside demons in the world of Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi. I hope that this song will become a treasure that everyone can treasure together! Please enjoy!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Masayoshi Oishi’s Comment</h2>\r\nI had the pleasure of writing and composing the opening theme song “Tooryanse!” I had always wanted to write a song for Nao Toyama and for a popular series like Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi, so I was incredibly happy when I was approached for this song! I wanted to create something lively with a distinct Japanese sound that was powerful and exotic. I hope this track brings  a little something extra to the work!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Release Information</h2>\r\nNovember 5, 2025\r\n\r\nLimited First Edition: VTZL-257\r\nCD and Blu-ray: 3,740 yen (tax incl.)\r\n\r\nLimited Anime Edition: VTZL-258\r\nCD and DVD: 2,860 yen (tax incl.)\r\n\r\nStandard Edition: VTCL-35388\r\nCD only: 1,540 (tax incl.) \r\n\r\n\t<h2>Streaming Information</h2>\r\n<a href=\"https://jvcmusic.lnk.to/toyamanao\">jvcmusic.lnk.to/toyamanao</a>\r\nAvailable on select music streaming services and major music download platforms such as iTunes Store, Rekochoku and mora.\r\nStreaming services:\r\nApple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, LINE MUSIC,  Amazon Music, Deezer, AWA, Rakuten Music, KKBOX\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Nao Toyama's Profile</h2>\r\nBirthday: March 11\r\nBlood Type: A\r\nHometown: Tokyo\r\nHobbies: Singing, dancing, playing the electric organ\r\n\r\nNao Toyama made her voice acting debut in 2010.

Known for its unique blend of American streetwear aesthetics and traditional Japanese visuals, Enter the Garden marks a bold departure from Japan’s traditional anime production model. Taniguchi shared his thoughts on creative freedom, artistic philosophy, and how Azuki’s community is reshaping what it means to create anime.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"mt80\" style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n<div class=\"hex hex-chevron mr10\" style=\"width:180px; height:360px; margin-top:-30px;\"> <!--Honey hex-->\r\n<div class=\"hex-rotate\">\t\r\n    <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Goro-Taniguchi.jpg')\" >\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"hex-text fz12 mt40\" style=\"color: #fff; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 1px #1374ad, -2px 2px 1px #1374ad, 2px -2px 1px #1374ad, -2px -2px 1px #1374ad; text-align:center;\">Goro Taniguchi</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\t\r\n\r\n<div class=\"hex hex-chevron mr10\" style=\"width:180px; height:360px; margin-top:-30px;\"> <!--TRUE hex-->\r\n<div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n    <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\" >\r\n         <div class=\"hex-text fz12 mt40\" style=\"color: #fff; font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 2px 2px 1px #1374ad, -2px 2px 1px #1374ad, 2px -2px 1px #1374ad, -2px -2px 1px #1374ad;\">Honey-Chan</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"text-center fz18 mt80\" style=\"color:#666666;\">Interview with Goro Taniguchi</div>\r\n[gray-hex-decoration]\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nYou've worked within the traditional Japanese pipeline of transforming an idea into anime.

This time working with Azuki, there was no original material to reference. So the process started with me asking, “Is this the right path?” and then presenting my ideas to Azuki. Sometimes those ideas were rejected, but the key has been constant communication between us. I’ve had to understand Azuki’s goals and translate that into animation. This open, cross-partner dialogue is very different from working with Japanese publishers or studios that produce anime, manga, or light novels in a traditional format. So far, it’s been a refreshing and exciting change for me.\t\t\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nEnter the Garden seems to be inspired heavily by modern American street fashion and traditional Japanese elements.

From there, we picked out the parts of their ideas that we understood or that we also thought were cool. Staff members who understood the concept arranged everything in the form of Episode 1, Episode 2, and Episode 3.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nAre there plans to introduce other cultural aspects from different countries in future episodes?\r\n\t\t\t</strong>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Goro-Taniguchi.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\nThat’s something I intentionally avoid. Digging deeper into the reasoning, the staff working on the project had already had that kind of idea in the past; however, we have agreed on focusing on one style identity with room for subtle influences. If I direct that they should include other cultural references, it may hinder the staff’s creativity. That’s something I would like to avoid. I believe that giving the team creative freedom yields better results. I purposely place staff who can generate something good without being influenced. To give more details, for episode 1, I assigned staff who had worked on things other than anime. In episode 2, I assigned staff who could also illustrate the 1980s to 2000s era’s anime style. By doing this, I can ensure each episode has its own uniqueness.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nWhat can you tell me about the character’s personality?

I didn’t see these suggestions as just coming from a company, but as a petition from the fans. So I made adjustments to my original vision. Anime is a business, yes, but it’s also for the fans.

As the director, I define clear creative boundaries. I explained the project and everyone’s responsibilities at the start. Mr. Tanaka understood exactly what his role was and where his creative domain lay. Once that’s clear, I don’t interfere unless someone steps outside their zone. That mutual respect is what keeps the environment clear of issues.\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">  \r\nGoro Taniguchi’s approach to Enter the Garden reveals a balance between personal creative vision and open collaboration with both Azuki and its growing community. This experimental project isn’t just about breaking anime conventions in format and production, it’s about exploring how far you can go when fan voices, corporate goals, and experienced direction meet halfway. With more episodes on the horizon and an evolving aesthetic, Enter the Garden may just be a blueprint for a new era of anime production where creators like Taniguchi continue to innovate beyond borders.    \r\n\t</div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\t\r\n\t\r\n[author author_id=\"020\" author=\"\" translator_id=\"\"]\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"hr-dashed mt40 mb40\">",

So under the company-wide policy of increasing lifetime value and expanding customer segments, we decided to take the lead in expanding offerings for kidults (adults with a playful spirit).\r\n\t\t\t\r\nAlthough the toy and hobby businesses may seem similar, their structures differ significantly. So for this initiative, we assembled a project team that included members beyond just management and our division. Together, we held in-depth discussions, looking ten years ahead, on how our company should approach and expand the kidult market from a medium- to long-term perspective.\r\n\r\nThrough those discussions, we realized that Takara TOMY now targets a wide spectrum of customers, from children to adults, and that this requires different approaches for each segment in both product development and marketing. In the hobby category especially, we recognized the need to clearly define and separate our kidult offerings. For instance, our official YouTube channel previously featured videos for both kids and adults, but to deliver more relevant content to each audience, shouldn’t we consider separating the channels?\r\n\r\nThere are also differences in focus between children’s and adults’ products when it comes to quality and ethical standards, raising the need for distinct criteria. As we looked to expand the kidult segment over the medium to long term, it became clear that clearer boundaries were needed. That led to the decision to launch a separate label for kidult-focused collector items. This was the rationale behind T-SPARK, and our vision has remained unchanged since its launch.\t\t\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nHow do you prepare your marketing strategies to reach its intended audience, particularly in international markets like here in the USA?\r\n        </strong>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/T-SPARK-logo.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n\t\t\t<b>Wakisawa:</b> We only began expanding into the U.S. market in 2025, so we’re still in the early stages, testing various strategies to see what works. While overall trends in the U.S. market aren’t drastically different from those in Japan, action figures are a particularly strong category, and in recent years, Japanese IPs have become extremely popular. By leveraging that interest in Japanese culture and applying Takara TOMY’s hobby expertise, we aim to develop new products and build awareness of the T-SPARK brand. Our appearance at AX this time is part of that effort.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we plan to roll out a variety of collaboration products featuring popular manga, anime, and other globally loved content. We’re also working to strengthen our online presence, centered around our North American e-commerce platform, Tommy Plus. At the same time, we want to create more offline touchpoints, such as places where fans can see product samples in person.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nHow do you approach targeting adult collectors over younger fans, especially when working with huge titles like My Hero Academia that attract multi-generational audiences?\r\n        </strong>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/T-SPARK-logo.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n\t\t\t<b>Miyauchi:</b> We believe that expanding the T-SPARK brand is essential to gaining traction with adult collectors.

From the long-term vision that led to creating a distinct label, to early steps in expanding into the U.S. market, and the thoughtful strategies behind engaging multi-generational fandoms with lines like SPARK Fig and COLLEKAZARO, it’s clear that T-SPARK represents more than just figures—it’s a commitment to redefining what it means to collect, connect, and celebrate Japanese pop culture on a global scale.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"hr-dashed mt40 mb40\">\r\n\r\n<!-- RP -->",

Written by Daoko and composed/arranged by Seiichi Nagai of QUBIT—where she also serves as lead vocalist—the track blends Nagai’s signature guitar work with Daoko’s playful voice and sharp wordplay. It delivers a kitschy, post-Shibuya-kei pop sound with a distinct “kawaii” vibe.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The jacket cover was done by Ace Akira, an artist known for combining pixel art and neon colors.

On the morning of the event, a crowd of eager participants far exceeding the number of tournament spots gathered at the booth, filling the venue with the passion and energy of US bladers even before the matches began.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Before a packed crowd, the closely contested tournament ended with ElenaBEY emerging as the winner. In the finals, she initially conceded a point to Yushua, who scored a “Survivor Finish,” but she quickly turned the tables by earning two points of her own. Yushua then caught up, tying the score and turning the match into a fierce, back-and-forth battle. In the end, ElenaBEY sealed her comeback victory with a stunning “Xtreme Finish” using an Attack-Type Beyblade. The crowd erupted in cheers at the dramatic conclusion, bringing the tournament to an exciting close that perfectly showcased the thrill of BEYBLADE X.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>After securing her spot at the world championship, ElenaBEY was warmly congratulated by fellow competitors who had battled alongside her. She shared that she began playing Beyblade after a friend’s suggestion. Her victory in Los Angeles, the entertainment capital of the world, inspired many spectators who witnessed it.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>With its new “Xtreme Dash” gimmick enabling ultra-acceleration, BEYBLADE X is the fastest in the brand’s history. It has captured the hearts of both players and spectators, gaining popularity worldwide as a form of “GEAR SPORTS.” Bladers from 20 regions*, are scheduled to compete in the upcoming World Championship, and qualifiers are underway worldwide. Keep an eye out for ElenaBEY as she takes the stage alongside other Bladers who have battled their way to the top.\r\n\r\n\t*In some countries, only one division is held, either the Regular Class (ages 6 to 12) or the Open Class (which is also open to adults).</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Comments From the Top 3</h2>\r\n\t<b>Winner: ElenaBEY:</b> \r\n\tThe friend who introduced me to Beyblade came to the venue today to cheer me on!

Their first songs under the new label will be the opening and ending theme songs for the TV anime Li’l Miss Vampire Can’t Suck Right.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Formed in 2012, H△G is a creative unit centered around their masked vocalist Chiho and includes members from a range of disciplines, including music production, engineering, and design. Free from the constraints of a conventional band, H△G has embraced a flexible music style to pursue innovative forms of expression. </li>\r\n\r\n<li>The opening theme song they’ve created evokes the feeling of youth and is overflowing with their unique style. A fitting song to mark their new beginning at Lantis. For the ending theme song, they collaborated with the anime’s heroine, Luna Ishikawa, voiced by Minami Tanaka. This special track is sure to draw attention as it deepens the show’s world-building. You can hear some snippets of the OP theme song “Seishun no Silhouette” (Youthful Silhouette) in the anime’s first promotional video.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/IQYLQsqO6Vw\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Release Information</h2>\r\n\t<b>“Seishun no Silhouette” (Opening theme of Li’l Miss Vampire Can’t Suck Right)</b>\r\nLyrics & composition: H△G\r\nArrangement: Anthurium\r\nArtist: H△G\r\n\r\n\t<b>“Senko Hanabi” (Ending theme of Li’l Miss Vampire Can’t Suck Right)</b>\r\nLyrics & composition: H△G\r\nArrangement: Ryo ‘LEFTY’ Miyata\r\nArtists: H△G, Luna Ishikawa (VA.

While visualizing nostalgia and sadness that can only be expressed in Japanese, they use unique sounds and lyrics to depict the “blueness” of youth, such as conflicts and heartaches. In 2017, H△G released a vocaloid cover album that has since surpassed 400 million streams on paid subscription services. They boast an especially high popularity abroad and began touring in Asia in 2024.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Concert Information</h2>\r\nAugust 10 in Taiwan at HANA SPACE\r\nAugust 16 & 17 in Aichi, Japan at IMAIKE GROW\r\n \r\nOfficial website: <a href=\"http://hag-official.jp\">hag-official.jp</a>\r\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/HAGofficial\">youtube.com/user/HAGofficial</a>\r\nX: <a href=\"https://x.com/HAG_official\">x.com/HAG_official</a>\r\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hag_official\">instagram.com/hag_official</a>\r\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hag.official\">facebook.com/hag.official</a>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: A Lonely Dragon Wants to Be Loved is the latest installment in the animated series, which started airing in 2017. Of course, seeing these popular scenes from the original work on the big screen has been a huge hit with the audiences!</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>On July 13th (Sunday), fhána and Sachiko Kobayashi made an appearance at AEON LakeTown mori, to help kick off the release of their respective opening and ending songs, “Parade of Tears” and “Bokutachi no Hibi.” Since Koshigaya in Saitama Prefecture serves as the story’s backdrop, the location couldn’t have been more fitting.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Tickets for the priority viewing area (which came with the purchase of one of the CDs being released that day) sold out in a flash. The space was packed with spectators before the event even started. Since there might not be enough time during the concert itself, Kevin Mitsunaga (sampler, etc.) gave the crowd a primer on the choreography for “Parade of Tears” during their rehearsal, and asked them to lead the rest of the audience for the real deal.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>About the Event</h2>\t\r\nThe event itself started right at 1:00 p.m., with fhána’s performance of one of the definitive opening themes from the anime, “Rhapsody of Blue Sky.” Towana (vocalist) got the audience all fired up as her voice rang out from the stage, accompanied by Junichi Sato on the keyboard, and Kevin on the metallophone. The crowd sang and clapped along, clearly enjoying their amazing pop performance.\r\n\r\nPausing just long enough to announce their group name, fhána launched straight into “Love Supreme!”, the opening song from Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid S. Towana and Kevin’s bright, bouncy rap makes it a memorable song, and their fast-paced repartee, mingled with the crowd’s applause, created an euphoric atmosphere.\r\n\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dragon-1942.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\r\n\r\nDuring the MC segment, they mentioned that they were pleased to be visiting Koshigaya for the first time. And most people in attendance raised their hands when asked whether or not they’d seen the Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid movie. On seeing that, Junichi mentioned that their next song had been “inspired by Kanna’s (CV. Maria Naganawa) tears.” Then, Kevin gave the crowd a quick review of the choreography before launching straight into the movie’s opening theme, “Parade of Tears.” The crowd was quick to put those moves into action when the chorus came around. Though, for an upbeat pop song, there’s an element of melancholy to it.\r\n\r\nSince fhána has created each of the series’ opening songs, their lyrics and melodies have really stuck with the listeners. Junichi joined in the dancing partway through, livening up the performance even further—but was probably going to limit that to this event. (Or possibly the upcoming Animelo Summer Live event.) ”Yeah, I think that’s it for the dancing,” he said, mellowing the mood out.\r\n\t\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dragon-1209.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\r\n\r\nThis was the perfect transition into the ending theme’s portion of the event. The audience called out for “Kobayashi-saaan!” (just like the titular character), Sachiko Kobayashi took to the stage to sing “Bokutachi no Hibi.” The message there is that “Nothing is certain, but that’s easy to forget. We might have met here by accident, but that’s a kind of miracle. These precious moments ought to be cherished.” \r\n\r\nStanding on stage in her stunning red dress, Sachiko’s gentle voice rang out, instantly catching everyone’s attention. Her voice couldn’t be better suited to a song that talks about how the “usual” things are the foundation of life. The performance was only a few minutes long, but it was a wonderfully moving piece that truly encapsulated the movie.\r\n\r\nAfter that touching finale to a rousing mini concert, fhána closed out the event by signing CDs that the fans had purchased.\r\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid: A Lonely Dragon Wants to be Loved is a huge hit! fhána and Sachiko Kobayashi’s opening and ending songs have gone on sale to great acclaim! Plus, it was okay to take pictures and videos at this event, so there are probably plenty of those to check out on social media.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>SETLIST</h2>\r\nRhapsody of Blue Sky - fhána\r\nLove Supreme! - fhána\r\nParade of Tears -  fhána\r\nBokutachi no Hibi - Sachiko Kobayashi\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Product Information</h2>\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: A Lonely Dragon Wants to Be Loved OP/ED Themes\r\nfhána, Sachiko Kobayashi “Parade of Tears & Bokutachi no Hibi”\r\nOut now!\r\n\r\nProduct Number: LACM-24690\r\nJAN: 4540774246908\r\nPrice: 1,650 yen (incl. tax)\r\n\t\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: A Lonely Dragon Wants to Be Loved Complete Musical Works (Masumi Ito)\r\nOut now!\r\n\r\nProduct Number: LACA-25161\r\nPrice: 3,300 yen (incl. tax)\t\r\n\r\n\t<b>Digital Release</b>\r\nfhána’s  “Parade of Tears” is now available on digital music platforms!\r\n<a href=\"https://lnk.to/LZC-3122\">lnk.to/LZC-3122</a>\r\n\r\nSachiko Kobayashi’s “Bokutachi no Hibi” is now available on digital music platforms!\r\n<a href=\"https://lnk.to/LZC-3123\">lnk.to/LZC-3123</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Music Videos Available Online!</h2>\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bmvbiNk_vXE\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/52dqFYXp89Q\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: A Lonely Dragon Wants to Be Loved - Now in Theaters!</h2>\r\nOfficial Website: <a href=\"https://maidragon.jp/movie\">maidragon.jp/movie</a>\r\nAnime Website: <a href=\"https://maidragon.jp\">maidragon.jp</a>\r\nAnime Official X: <a href=\"https://x.com/maidragon_anime\">x.com/maidragon_anime</a>\r\nAnime Official TikTok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@maidragon_anime_official\">tiktok.com/@maidragon_anime_official</a>\r\nRecommended Hashtags: #KobayashiDragonMovie #DragonMaid\r\n\t</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

While it doesn't seem too crowded, I look to the first floor front-row seats to see several groups of what appear to be fans in cosplay, checking their penlights. Looking at the screen, I see a QR code to download the app that will be used to determine each battle's winner, as well as how to vote during the screening. This won't be your typical theater experience — it's something entirely new, where the outcome of the movie lies in the hands of the audience.\r\n\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Report_image03-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\r\n\t\r\n\"Hypnosis Mic -Division Rap Battle-\", or \"HypMic\" for short, is a story set in a world where armed conflict is illegal, and territory is instead gained via rap battles using Hypnosis Mics, special microphones that interfere with human psyche. Teams representing each division compete in the \"Division Rap Battles\", led by the all-female team Party of Words.\r\n\r\nBattles are fought in teams of 3, with 6 teams total:\r\n→ Buster Bros!!!: Ikebukuro Division\r\n→ MAD TRIGGER CREW: Yokohama Division \r\n→ Fling Posse: Shibuya Division\r\n→ Matenro: Shinjuku Division\r\n→ Bad Ass Temple: Nagoya Division\r\n→ DOTSUITARE-HOMPO: Osaka Division\r\n\t\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Report_image04-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\r\n\r\nThe team that wins the first and second stages will proceed to the final stage where they can challenge the Party of Words in battle. The full movie covers events up until the final stage, but for this specially-edited AX closing screening, only up until the second stage is shown.\r\n\r\nBut what sets this movie experience apart is the mid-movie voting, done via a mobile app called CtrlMovie. After each battle's conclusion, a 10-second countdown begins on the app where viewers vote for the best-performing team by tapping the division's logo. After a few seconds, the winning team is displayed and the story continues.\r\n\r\nAs the fate of each team is decided by the audience, even for those who might not call themselves fans, the tension in the room as the countdown begins is electric. As the result flashes on the screen, the audience erupts—united in a chorus of both joy and heartbreak that reverberates through the theater.\r\n\r\nThe characters' reactions and comments differ depending on the results, which makes every viewing a unique thrill. In total there are a whole 48 different ways the story can play out. Fans will watch them all, no doubt.\r\n\r\nI realize it's almost time for the movie to start and take a last look around behind me to see that the seats are now filled to overflowing, with even more people standing behind the last row. The first floor is of course also packed. Seeing this spectacle, I feel the excitement building as the MC stirs up the crowd. Then, the screening finally starts.\r\n\r\nOver the roars of the crowd, the first thing we see are clips introducing each division. Every team is met with screams of excitement, with the waving penlights changing color each time. I now realize that the pre-screening penlight checking was for this all-important color-changing operation. The introductions perfectly capture each team member's characteristics and their relationships with each other. Next is the opening video, where we get to hear everyone’s singing voices, and includes every character. The battleground is set. The cheers were so loud for every single division that I could not even guess which one might win.\r\n\t\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Report_image05-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\r\n\t\r\nAnd now for the rap battles to begin!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>First stage, first battle</h2>\r\nBuster Bros!!! Vs Bad Ass Temple\r\nThe battle between Ichiro (Buster Bros!!! leader) and Kuko (Bad Ass Temple leader), who are former teammates, is a must-see. \r\n\r\nTime for the vote of destiny. After a short silence, Buster Bros!!!’s logo appears on the screen, followed by loud cheering and crying.\r\n\r\nUp on the screen, Kuko approaches Ichiro and they congratulate one another. Fans cheer out warmly.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>First stage, second battle</h2>\r\nMAD TRIGGER CREW Vs DOTSUITARE-HOMPO\r\nSamatoki (leader of MAD TRIGGER CREW) and Sasara (DOTSUITARE-HOMPO leader) were also once partners on the same team. They know each other inside out — every strength and every weakness. But today isn't a duel. It's a team battle, where the team that unites their strengths to the fullest seizes victory.\r\n\r\nVoting time again. A few seconds pass in silence before DOTSUITARE-HOMPO's logo flashes onto the screen. The crowd erupts.\r\n\r\nIn the face of his loss, Samatoki speaks gracefully and the crowd’s comforting words left an impression.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>First stage, third battle</h2>\r\nFling Posse vs Matenro\r\nRamuda (leader of Fling Posse) and Jakurai (Matenro's leader) say they hate one-another, but what is the truth...?\r\n\r\nDuring the battle their faces were so close they almost touched, which resulted in cheering and screaming throughout the venue every time.\r\n\r\nOnce again it is time to vote, and after a short silence, Matenro's logo appears and is met with loud cheering and screaming.\r\n\r\nThe resentment between the two leaders fades and Jakurai approaches Ramuda amicably, but Ramuda's irritation at Jakurai's unintentionally condescending remarks makes for an amusing conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe second stage is a tournament between the three teams that won the first stage.\r\n\r\nBuster Bros!!! Vs DOTSUITARE-HOMPO vs Matenro\r\n\r\nFate once again is in our hands, and this time the choice is between three teams. Cheers for each team echo across the venue, but it's DOTSUITARE-HOMPO who claim victory. The cheering and the screaming reach their climax.\r\n\r\nAt long last, it's time for the final battle with Party of Words. The MC reappears and the screening comes to an end. While the winning division was not my first choice, the result made me very interested to see what a battle between the Kansai team DOTSUITARE-HOMPO and the all-female team Party of Words would look like. \r\n\r\nYou can check out the results via the link below:\r\n<a href=\"https://hypnosismic-movie.com/voting-status/ax2025\">hypnosismic-movie.com/voting-status/ax2025</a>\r\nYou can also check out the results for all the screenings held in Japan here:\r\n<a href=\"https://hypnosismic-movie.com/voting-status/results\">hypnosismic-movie.com/voting-status/results</a>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>\"Uta no☆Prince-sama TABOO NIGHT XXXX\"</h2>\r\nAfter a (small) switch up in the audience between HypMic and Uta☆Pri fans, the MC introduces the next feature and turns the fans' excitement all the way up! This movie is the third theatrical release for Uta☆Pri and contains a full-length live concert as well as a brand-new animation featuring QUARTET NIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe \"Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Maji Love\" series is a part of the larger Uta☆Pri multimedia franchise, originally a romance visual novel aimed at women. The movie features four members who form the idol unit QUARTET NIGHT:\r\n→ Reiji Kotobuki\r\n→ Ranmaru Kurosaki\r\n→ Ai Mikaze\r\n→ Camus\r\n\r\nSetlist:\r\n* Jewelful XXXX\r\nSeize me if you can (Reiji)\r\nForce & Faith (Ranmaru)\r\nWandering in a maze (Ai) \r\nDo you know who I’m (Camus)\r\n* Ice Pierrot (Camus)\r\n* Zero (Reiji)\r\n* Black Panther (Ranmaru)\r\n* Am I a fairy or...? (Ai)\r\n* The RUN to the RAY (Reiji & Ranmaru)\r\n* God Love (Ai & Camus)\r\n* TABOO NIGHT XXXX (all members)\r\n* JINN-Ω-RAY (all members)\r\n\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Report_image06-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\r\n\t\r\nThe audience cheered and changed the color of their penlights for each idol, and joined in every single idol call. And in perfect Japanese, of course.It was just like being at an idol concert in Japan.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing both movies, I was reminded that the love and enthusiasm of fans here rivals — or perhaps even surpasses — that of fans in Japan. From the happy faces of the fans after the screening, there is no doubt that this passion and love will continue to grow.\r\n\r\n\t<b>— King Records Editorial Department</b>\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Event outline</h3>\r\nAnime Expo 2025\r\n\"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle- Movie” & “Uta no☆Prince-sama♪  TABOO NIGHT XXXX\" Screening\r\nJuly 5, 12:30 – 2:30 PM | The Novo\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Screening information</h3>\r\n\"HYPNOSISMIC -Division Rap Battle- Movie”\r\n<a href=\"https://hypnosismic-movie.com/\">hypnosismic-movie.com</a>\r\n“Uta no☆Prince-sama♪  TABOO NIGHT XXXX\"\r\n<a href=\"https://taboonightxxxx.utapri-movie.com/\">taboonightxxxx.utapri-movie.com</a>\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Contact  information</b>\r\nFor more information or  inquiries, please contact:\r\nShunsuke Souma\r\nshunsuke-souma@kingrecords.co.jp\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

This marks the second consecutive year the festival has appeared at South America’s largest anime convention, which draws an annual attendance of around 150,000.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Bandai Namco Music Live manages labels including Lantis, SUNRISE Music, Kiramune, MoooD Records, and UNIERA, and is home to a diverse roster of artists. On the festival’s opening day, four acts took the stage: ASH DA HERO, STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION, Nowlu, and MindaRyn.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>TUfave is excited to announce its new collaboration jewelry collection with the TV anime “Attack on Titan”. These necklaces (5 designs total) delicately capture the attractiveness of the characters and the series' world, inspired by iconic scenes. Each piece features a simple design centered around a large natural stone, creating \"collaboration jewelry for adults\" that subtly blends into daily life.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Nowlu Kicks Off the Show with Her Anisong Debut</h2>\r\nNowlu opened the festival with a confident performance that defied the fact it was her first-ever live show. She began with “Arika” (GUILTY GEAR STRIVE: DUAL RULERS) and “yoin” (Wingman).\r\n\r\n“I’m so happy to have my first live show here in São Paulo,” she said with a smile, drawing warm cheers. She followed with “Stuck on you” (More Than a Married Couple, But Not Lovers), creating a calm, intimate moment that brought the crowd together. Her debut ended to enthusiastic applause.\r\n\r\nNext up was a DJ set by ASH DA HERO member DJ Dhalsim. The crowd couldn’t help but dance as he spun one anisong hit after another: “Ai♡Scream!”, “Bokura wa Ima no Naka de” (Love Live!), “Shika-iro Days” (My Deer Friend Nokotan), and “Hare Hare Yukai” (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya). The energy of anisong swept through São Paulo, connecting fans across generations.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>“Brazil, I’m back!” MindaRyn Returns with a Smile</h2>\r\nMindaRyn took the stage next, returning for a second year in a row. “Brazil, I’m back!” she called out with a big smile before launching into a set of three powerful yet gentle songs: “Daylight” (Arifureta: From Commonplace to World’s Strongest Season 2), “Shiny Girl” (SHY), and “Fireworks” (Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke’s Mansion).\r\n\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC09937-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\r\n\t\r\nDuring her MC segment, she asked, “Was anyone here last year? Thanks to those seeing me for the first time, too!” connecting warmly with the audience. As part of her world tour Hello New Friends, which began in June 2025, she performs special covers of songs from her label, Lantis. For Brazil, she sang “Rhapsody of Blue Sky” (Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, originally by fhána) and “Sparkling Daydream” (Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions, originally by ZAQ).\r\n\r\nShe followed with a high-energy rock trio: “HIBANA” (Sengoku Youko: The Reformer Siblings Arc), “SURVIVE” (Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke’s Mansion), and her breakout hit “Like Flames” (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Season 2), which has surpassed 22 million views on YouTube. Her explosive performance had the entire venue fired up.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION: Sound and Vision in Perfect Sync</h2>\r\nSTEREO DIVE FOUNDATION (R・O・N) made his Brazilian debut with a 17-song medley set to anime visuals. Highlights included “ALPHA” (Moriarty the Patriot), “Renegade” (GANGSTA), and the fan-favorite “STORYSEEKER” (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Season 2), which has surpassed 10 million views on YouTube.\r\n\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KS309929-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\t\r\n\t\r\nThe set closed with “Daisy” (Beyond the Boundary), with the crowd gently swaying their hands in unison.

The crowd responded with knowing nods and applause.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Surprise Collaboration with Ultraman Omega!</h2>\r\nAfter a brief pause, the word “Ultraman” appeared on the screen, instantly stirring the crowd. MindaRyn returned to perform “BLACK STAR” (Ultraman Blazer), followed by an appearance from Ultraman Blazer himself, drawing cheers and excitement.\r\n\t\r\n<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KIV00575_c入り.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\r\n\r\nThe event then transitioned into the new series Ultraman Omega.

Kicking off with “Super Sonic,” they followed with “YELLOW FEVER DANCE” and “Hankou Seimei” as the crowd pumped their fists and sang along.\r\n\r\nThey kept the energy high with “LA VIDA LOCA,” already a live anthem despite being a recent release, then surprised the audience with “Octave” and “Beast Mode,” insert songs from Blue Lock: Episode Nagi, accompanied by anime footage. After introducing the members, they launched into “Judgement,” the opening theme for the anime’s second cour.

Set within a stone frame designed to evoke the shattered brick streets, a teardrop-shaped onyx symbolizes the tears. Onyx, known as the stone of \"endurance\" and \"success,\" with its deep black color, reflects Eren’s turbulent emotions. Above the onyx, a sparkling green cubic zirconia mirrors the color of Eren’s eyes, adding a striking contrast. On the back, the key to the basement—worn by Eren—is engraved, adding a meaningful touch to this tribute piece.\r\n\r\nPrice: \\24,200 JPY\r\nMaterials: 925 Sterling Silver (Rhodium Plated), Onyx, Cubic Zirconia\r\nSize: Height 16.2mm, Width 7.6mm [Chain] Length 45cm (17.72\") (adjustable to 40cm (15.75\"))\r\n\t\r\n\t<h3>Mikasa Necklace</h3>\t\r\n\t<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.Mikasa1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\t\r\n\t\r\n“...FOR WRAPPING THIS SCARF... ...AROUND ME... ”\r\n\r\nSeason 2　Episode 37\r\n\r\nThis piece is inspired by the scene where Mikasa is wrapped in a scarf. A red agate—symbolizing “bond”, “protection” and “passion”—represents the color of the scarf. Set in a softly contoured frame that evokes the gentle texture of fabric, the design captures the image of Mikasa wrapped in the scarf. The bail features a floral stone frame accented with blue cubic zirconia, representing the flowers that bloomed at her feet in that moment.

At its center is a smoky quartz, a stone known for symbolizing “responsibility” and “comfort,” with a color that evokes Hange’s hair. Above it sits a cubic zirconia representing the color of Hange’s eyes. The sharp silhouette and combination of stone colors express Hange’s intelligence and individuality.

That means it has been 25 years since BEYBLADE first arrived in America. Last year was our first time bringing BEYBLADE to Anime Expo and we were very, very surprised and excited to find so many adult fans here. We have always believed the potential of American fans and community, and seeing their passion firsthand was a very great opportunity for us. That’s why we wanted to return and hold the tournament at this year's event.\r\n\r\nBEYBLADE started just as a toy, but we’ve been aiming towards making it an entertainment sport, that’s why we thought about Los Angeles, the city of entertainment. Anime Expo is a very, very huge event so, in line with our branch’s story, this is a very suitable opportunity and a suitable event at AX. If you had the chance to come here during the morning (Saturday, July 5, 2025) there were so many people in line, we were not expecting so many fans to show up! Last year, BEYBLADE was here, but this year is the first time that we’ve held a tournament. We could not have imagined the number of people who attended. We were pleasantly surprised and very impressed with the number of attendees.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BEYBLADE-X-National-Tournament.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"667\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-359726\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nWhat are you hoping that fans take away from this event, or what were you expecting to show fans by holding this tournament here at AX?\r\n        </strong>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Yamazaki.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\nFrom what I’ve seen, there’s a great opportunity to further grow and support adult tournaments in the U.S. I want to give hope that in the future, we will have more and more events for the American fans.

Right now, nearly 40 million visitors from around the world have joined the BEYBLADE world on Roblox. I can see that technology is important, but from what I can see the most important thing is the community. BEYBLADE fans are encouraged to enjoy the brand in many ways, so it has great potential to cultivate a community no matter what technology it expands to. But we’ve committed to grow the community rather than focusing on introducing the brand to new technology.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nWhy did you choose Roblox as the “community builder” for BEYBLADE?\r\n        </strong>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Takaoka.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\nIn Japan, Roblox is not really popular yet, but in the U.S.A, as well as other parts of Asia it's really popular. BEYBLADEs’ strength is that they can provide a physical experience, at the same time, this is our weakness. We want fans to enjoy BEYBLADE globally, but as of right now, Roblox is the answer the fans have created. And the fantastic thing is that you can play it from anywhere.\r\n\r\n[Takaoka proceeds to take out his phone, which is already online on Roblox and actively spectating a BEYBLADE match between real people that are online at that moment]\t\t\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Yamazaki.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\nThe players of that BEYBLADE world in Roblox, the total of Japanese players is maybe around 5% but the other 95% are from all over the world; number one is currently Thailand, followed by Mexico and the U.S.A.

First of all, BEYBLADE X is a product that can be enjoyed by children and adults, so our priority is safety. At the same time, it has to be truly thrilling and fun to play. Although it seems at odds with safety the features that make the game exciting—like high-speed, intense collisions are essential for our products so it is a big challenge for us to pursue both aspects. We try not to have tradeoffs or compromises, they try to deliver all those points at the highest possible “level”, This is something we really take care of when thinking about new model designs.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nAs a competitive game, BEYBLADE must often introduce different \"battle strategies\".

If it goes faster, would it be interesting? If it falls apart, will it be interesting? Those kinds of unique ideas are always brought forward by the team and we bring it to life as a demo product by the design team to test it out. After everyone has experienced it and it makes sense as a strategy, then the idea will move on to the next level until it makes it to the actual product. One thing we’re always taking care of is that we don’t create only an idea, but also create a demo product to test it out within the team.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nAs for battle gimmicks like the X-Dash, so far what has been the most challenging or interesting gimmick that you have created?\r\n        </strong>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Muraki.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n3rd generation BEYBLADE Burst.

On top of that, we had to achieve for it to spin super fast and all the pieces would fly out all over the place, so safety was a challenge. Before this model, the arena did not have the guard piece, so we had to come up with the arena barrier too. \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\n        <strong>\r\nNow that you have seen the popularity of BEYBLADE X in Anime Expo, and of course, Anime Expo caters to an Otaku culture, do you have in mind any collaboration with some big anime title?

I like this style of celebrating, it's something I am really glad to see, hahaha.\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Yamazaki.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\nDuring BEYBLADE’s panel event at AX, we played the first episode of our new anime season. The fans there were very very excited and had a good reaction. But we not only talked about the animation, we also talked about BEYBLADE as a product and the community was very curious about how we design our toys, about the making process. It gave me the impression that the U.S. fans are extremely curious about BEYBLADE, so I enjoyed their reaction to our panel.  \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt40\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--Sōhei Matsuura hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Muraki.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">\r\nWhen I saw the participants of the tournaments and noticed the kind of Beys that they use I thought their selections were interesting. Usually, when you compete in tournaments, the ultimate goal should be to win, right? But seeing the U.S. participants, they are using the BEYBLADEs that they really like, ones that they have emotional attachments to. The ratio is a lot higher in the U.S. than in Japan. The way that fans enjoy BEYBLADE X here in the U.S. is wider, so that’s the point of view I gained from this experience and I will take it into consideration for future product design.  \r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row mt80\">\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-12 pa0\">\r\n        <div class=\"hex hex-chevron ml30\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 160px; margin-top:-30px\">\r\n            <!--honey hex-->\r\n            <div class=\"hex-rotate\">\r\n                <div class=\"hex-bg\" style=\"background-image: url('http://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-honey-horizontal.jpg')\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-8 col-xs-12\">  \r\nThe passion and enthusiasm surrounding BEYBLADE X at Anime Expo 2025 was undeniable. It's clear that BEYBLADE continues to evolve as more than just a toy, it’s a global phenomenon fueled by community, creativity, and competition. With plans to return and expand further into U.S. events, the future of BEYBLADE is spinning faster than ever!\t\t\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><!---honeyhex---->\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"hr-dashed mt40 mb40\">\r\n\r\n<!-- RP -->",

They made a surprise debut announcement and held their first event at Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, one of the world’s largest anime conventions with around 400,000 attendees annually.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Kicking off with the surprise announcement at Anime Expo 2025, NOVA officially launched their music career under a new label, UNIVOLT, created in collaboration with Universal Music.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>NOVA is VShojo’s first Japanese-speaking VTuber group, consisting of Akatsuki Hotaru, Hestia Happiness, Okamoto Nagi, and Yutori Peke. They made their livestream debut in November 2024, drawing attention as part of VShojo’s full-scale entry into the Japanese market. Set in a fantasy world where they travel through a post-apocalyptic parallel universe, each of the group’s four unique characters has their own background and profession. They primarily stream in Japanese on YouTube and Twitch.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Their debut track, “Starry Connection,” was released today at 13:00 (JST), alongside its official music video. It features a Japanese hyper pop sound that highlights the unique personalities of all four members. The lyrics were written by utumiyqcom, who appeared on Rap Star, and the music was composed by up-and-coming Vocaloid producer Tokyo Manaka. The song is packed with NOVA’s signature flair, even incorporating the members’ names into the lyrics. The music video, produced by Toei Zukun Laboratory, vividly brings NOVA’s fantasy world to life.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/QXJ28-1FBAg\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>“Starry Connection” on download and streaming websites</b>\r\n<a href=\"https://lnk.to/NOVA_SC\">lnk.to/NOVA_SC</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>VShojo’s Profile</h2>\r\nVShojo’s first Japanese-speaking VTuber group, consisting of Akatsuki Hotaru, Hestia Happiness, Okamoto Nagi, and Yutori Peke.

Back in the day, there were tons of different titles and approaches to the sport, and most of them had their own unique charm, offering countless hours of fun with friends and siblings.\r\n\r\nAmong the standouts, the Goal! franchise was probably our favorite… and now it’s back in full glory, with both classic games bundled into one awesome package!\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wrap-unit\" id=\"scroll-short-length-unit1\">\r\n  <h1>\r\nFootball Unites the World\r\n\t</h1>\t\t\r\n\t\r\n  <div class=\"wrap-paragraph mt30\">\r\n    <p>\r\nYes, that’s actually one of FIFA’s recent slogans (the organization, not the video game series), and it perfectly captures one of the highlights of this new bundle.\r\n\r\nOriginally developed by Tose and published by Jaleco (both Japanese companies) Goal! (known in Japan as Moero!! Pro Soccer) debuted in 1988. It was later localized for North America and Europe, with slightly different versions released in each region. Thanks to its popularity, a sequel followed in 1992, launching globally. But things weren’t as straightforward as they might seem…\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!-- IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE -->\r\n  <div align=\"center\">\r\n    <div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n      <div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jaleco_roster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-height-500 wp-image-312937\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        [sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <!-- /IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE -->\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nBecause the games were released in different regions and on different consoles, there are a number of notable differences—not just in the titles, but in the content itself. For instance, the lineup of national teams varies by version. In the Japanese release of Goal!, Uruguay and the USA are not included; instead, players get Northern Ireland and Scotland. Goal! Two features even more regional variation: the Japanese version includes teams like Colombia, Ghana, and Austria, while the Western release swaps them out for Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela. Meanwhile, the USSR and West Germany are present in the NES version but were omitted from the SNES port.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this new bundle includes all versions of both games, giving players access to every regional team, no matter where they were originally released.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div><!-- /.wrap-unit -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wrap-unit\" id=\"scroll-short-length-unit1\">\r\n  <h1>\r\nA Perfect Title for Collectors!\r\n\t</h1>\t\r\n\r\n<!-- IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE -->\r\n  <div align=\"center\">\r\n    <div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n      <div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jaleco_manual.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-height-500 wp-image-312937\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        [sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <!-- /IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE -->\r\n\t\r\n  <div class=\"wrap-paragraph mt30\">\r\n    <p>\r\nAnother feature we absolutely loved is the inclusion of all the original cover art and instruction manuals. Back in the '80s and '90s, reading and re-reading those little booklets, or proudly displaying them on your shelf, was a big part of the whole video game experience.\r\n\t\t\t\r\nSure, these games aren’t exactly complex in terms of controls or mechanics—after all, most systems back then only had a couple of buttons to work with. In fact, most of the instructions now feel like plain common sense to today’s players. Still, having access to the original manuals feels oddly refreshing. And best of all, you can switch languages with a single button press.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div><!-- /.wrap-unit -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wrap-unit\" id=\"scroll-short-length-unit3\">\r\n  <h1>\r\nAnd What About the Gameplay?\r\n  </h1>\r\n\r\n<!-- IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE -->\r\n  <div align=\"center\">\r\n    <div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n      <div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jaleco_goal1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-height-500 wp-image-312937\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        [sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <!-- /IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE -->\t\r\n\t\r\n  <div class=\"wrap-paragraph mt30\">\r\n    <p>\r\nThe most notable addition to this bundle is the ability to rewind time at any moment (like in some racing games), whether it’s to stop a goal from being scored, avoid a yellow or red card, or simply get a second chance after completely shanking a shot into the stratosphere.\r\n\t\t\t\r\nWas it necessary? Probably not. Does it feel like cheating? Absolutely, and football purists will no doubt see it as a disgrace to the sport. But hey, it’s 100% optional, so no harm done… right? If anything, it’s just a modern safety net for retro frustration. \r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n\t\r\n<!-- IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE -->\r\n  <div align=\"center\">\r\n    <div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n      <div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jaleco_goal2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-height-500 wp-image-312937\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        [sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <!-- /IF NOT NEEDED, DELETE -->\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"wrap-paragraph mt30\">\r\n    <p>\r\nNo one expects games from four decades ago to stand toe-to-toe with modern sensations like EA FC, PES, or even Rematch. But firing up a few Goal! or Goal! Two matches with friends, whether out of nostalgia or curiosity, depending on your age, can still be a blast.\r\n\t\t\t\r\nSure, we don’t see ourselves playing these games non-stop for days, but we genuinely enjoyed re-adapting to the punishing controls and arcade-style gameplay. Plus, there's something charming about scoring goals with national teams from countries that you don’t typically find in other football games, or that don’t even exist anymore. Nevertheless, if you like competing online, you can compete against other players on the monthly leaderboards! \r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\t\r\n</div><!-- /.wrap-unit -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"hr-dashed mt40 mb40\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id=\"scroll-recommendations-end\">\r\n  <h1>\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n  </h1>\r\n  \r\n  <p class=\"mt30\">\r\nJaleco Sports: Goal!, the remake developed by Sickhead Games and Rock It Games, is one of those bundles we’re just happy to have in our library, ready to launch now and then for a few laughs and a trip down memory lane.\r\n\r\nThe game is available for Windows PC via Steam and GOG. It's been announced there will be a PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch release later this year. \r\n  </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n[author author_id=\"063\" author=\"\" translator_id=\"\"]\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"hr-dashed mt40 mb40\">",

The studio will develop, produce, and globally distribute original IPs and anime adaptations through unique production models shaped by the creative DNA of Azuki and its partners.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Originally launched as an NFT project, <a href=\"https://www.azuki.com/about\">Azuki</a> has been at the forefront in blending anime production with technologies and social media, while fostering collaboration between global creators and Japanese anime talents. By forming a joint venture with COMISMA and Xenotoon—both of which bring strong anime production expertise—Studio Azuki aims to strengthen its creative capacity and position itself as a next-generation global anime studio.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Azuki has been at the forefront of the rapidly growing global anime fandom, particularly in the U.S., where enthusiasm spans general audiences, Hollywood creators, celebrities, and businesses. Studio Azuki fuses this international momentum with Japan’s anime culture to pioneer new production models, elevate storytelling quality, enable fan collaboration, and introduce social-first formats that define the future of global anime.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Guided by its “Anime 2.0” vision, Azuki has launched several key initiatives, including the <a href=\"https://www.anime.com/shows/azuki\">Enter The Garden</a> anthology series, <a href=\"https://www.anime.com/\">Anime.com</a>, and being an early contributor to Animecoin Foundation. Studio Azuki will continue to explore how these platforms and blockchain technology can reshape the way anime is financed, produced, and experienced.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>COMISMA, a founding partner of the new studio, is known for operating the manga app GANMA! and cultivating original works. It also owns the high-end animation studio Qzil.la. Xenotoon, meanwhile, brings a robust 2D/3D production pipeline and a creator-first studio network, exemplified by its collaborations with indie animators such as those behind <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@gensho_yasuda\">Yasuda Gensho</a>.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>“With a global-first, creator-centric, and social-native approach, Studio Azuki is our bold step toward building the next generation of anime, one that empowers creators, & connects directly with fans,” said Feb Tea, Head of Content at Azuki Labs. “By joining forces with COMISMA and Xenotoon, we’re combining deep, authentic anime production expertise with fresh creative energy and global perspective.

At COMISMA, we have long been guided by our mission to make 'manga artist' a dream profession for children. Through trust in creators and strong engagement with fans, we have delivered many successful IPs to the world. With our anime studio Qzil.la focused on high-end anime, we aim to create globally beloved anime titles. I look forward to driving the industry's growth through Studio Azuki.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Comment From Koichi Kawase, CEO of Xenotoon Inc.</h2>\r\nWe are thrilled to announce the formation of Studio Azuki alongside such strong partners as Azuki and COMISMA. Our studio has experience across everything from social media-first short-form anime to feature-length theatrical works. From the beginning, our three companies shared a strong vision for the future of anime and entertainment. I believe it was inevitable that we would create a groundbreaking global studio together. This also marks a turning point in realizing our long-held vision to democratize the anime production, funding, and distribution pipeline. We look forward to creating a new chapter in anime history and co-creating titles that will captivate the world.\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Comment From Ko Yada, CEO of Westbrook Inc.</h2>\r\nAt Westbrook, our mission has always been to tell stories that connect, inspire, and transcend borders. Partnering with Studio Azuki is a powerful step in that direction. Their creative vision and cultural insight align seamlessly with our global strategy. Together, we’re excited to identify and develop projects that resonate deeply with audiences around the world, blending authentic storytelling with boundary-pushing innovation.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Strategic Partnership with Westbrook Inc.</h2>\r\nIn conjunction with the studio’s formation, Studio Azuki has entered into a strategic partnership with Westbrook Inc., the global media company founded by Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith, Miguel Melendez, and Ko Yada, focused on empowering artists to tell stories that connect the world.. By combining Studio Azuki’s production capabilities with Westbrook’s deep Hollywood network and expertise in global entertainment, the partnership aims to bring next-generation anime content to audiences worldwide.\r\n\t\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

Take back your freedom with wings of anti-gravity, and seize hope.\r\n\r\nIn a near-future Earth where science has advanced and civilization has flourished, humanity developed a device called the Cross Dimension, enabling access to the Multiverse.\r\n\r\nThis breakthrough allowed humans to make contact with beings from alternate worlds, regardless of whether they were two-dimensional or three-dimensional.\r\n\r\nThe barriers between dimensions had fallen, and the world cultivated even greater wisdom and wealth.\r\n\r\nHowever, one day, a catastrophic system failure known as the Dimension Accident occurred, causing countless worlds influenced by the Cross Dimension to merge into a single, unified realm.\r\n\r\nAlthough this unprecedented convergence plunged every world into chaos, order was gradually restored under the guidance of the United Earth Forces’ organization, the United Birth.\r\n\r\nYet, numerous problems remained.\r\n\r\nThe merging of worlds brought about unknown disasters and mysterious enemies immune to conventional weapons.\r\nTo make matters worse, a faction known as Nemesis Gravitas (hereafter referred to as Nemesis) began exploiting the Gravity Core, the energy source of the Cross Dimension, in an attempt to dominate the residents of each world.\r\n\r\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://axgrit.com\">axgrit.com</a>\r\nOfficial X (Twitter): <a href=\"https://x.com/axgrit\">x.com/axgrit</a>\r\nContact: axgrit@dcoco.co.jp\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t<h2>About hololive production</h2>\r\nhololive production is one of the world’s largest virtual talent agencies.\r\nIt manages the female VTuber group hololive and the male VTuber group HOLOSTARS, whose combined YouTube subscriber count exceeds 80 million.\r\nThrough live streaming, music, and events, they engage with fans all around the globe.\r\n\r\nhololive production Official Website: <a href=\"hololivepro.com\">hololivepro.com</a>\r\nhololive production Official X (formerly Twitter): <a href=\"x.com/hololivetv\">https://x.com/hololivetv</a>\r\nhololive production Official TikTok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@hololive_official\">tiktok.com/@hololive_official</a>\r\nhololive production Event Official X: <a href=\"https://x.com/hololive_event\">x.com/hololive_event</a>\r\nhololive production Official Shop: <a href=\"https://shop.hololivepro.com\">shop.hololivepro.com</a>\r\n“QR Code” is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.\r\n“X (formerly Twitter)” is a trademark or registered trademark of X Corp.

Take back your freedom with wings of anti-gravity, and seize hope.\r\n\r\nIn a near-future Earth where science has advanced and civilization has flourished, humanity developed a device called the Cross Dimension, enabling access to the Multiverse.\r\n\r\nThis breakthrough allowed humans to make contact with beings from alternate worlds, regardless of whether they were two-dimensional or three-dimensional.\r\n\r\nThe barriers between dimensions had fallen, and the world cultivated even greater wisdom and wealth.\r\n\r\nHowever, one day, a catastrophic system failure known as the Dimension Accident occurred, causing countless worlds influenced by the Cross Dimension to merge into a single, unified realm.\r\n\r\nAlthough this unprecedented convergence plunged every world into chaos, order was gradually restored under the guidance of the United Earth Forces’ organization, the United Birth.\r\n\r\nYet, numerous problems remained.\r\n\r\nThe merging of worlds brought about unknown disasters and mysterious enemies immune to conventional weapons.\r\nTo make matters worse, a faction known as Nemesis Gravitas (hereafter referred to as Nemesis) began exploiting the Gravity Core, the energy source of the Cross Dimension, in an attempt to dominate the residents of each world.\r\n\r\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://axgrit.com\">axgrit.com</a>\r\nOfficial X (Twitter): <a href=\"https://x.com/axgrit\">x.com/axgrit</a>\r\nContact: axgrit@dcoco.co.jp\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t<h2>About hololive production</h2>\r\nhololive production is one of the world’s largest virtual talent agencies.\r\nIt manages the female VTuber group hololive and the male VTuber group HOLOSTARS, whose combined YouTube subscriber count exceeds 80 million.\r\nThrough live streaming, music, and events, they engage with fans all around the globe.\r\n\r\nhololive production Official Website: <a href=\"hololivepro.com\">hololivepro.com</a>\r\nhololive production Official X (formerly Twitter): <a href=\"x.com/hololivetv\">https://x.com/hololivetv</a>\r\nhololive production Official TikTok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@hololive_official\">tiktok.com/@hololive_official</a>\r\nhololive production Event Official X: <a href=\"https://x.com/hololive_event\">x.com/hololive_event</a>\r\nhololive production Official Shop: <a href=\"https://shop.hololivepro.com\">shop.hololivepro.com</a>\r\n“QR Code” is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.\r\n“X (formerly Twitter)” is a trademark or registered trademark of X Corp.

The six new songs for Round 3 include titles that will resonate with an even wider range of generations than the original 22. With the addition of new arrangers, we believe this round offers more than ever for both anime song fans and choral music lovers alike. We hope ChoieL continues to be a place where you can express your passion to the fullest.\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Tatsuya Tanaka (Composer)</h3>\r\nThe ChoieL online choir competition is now entering its third round.

As a group brought together by our love of anime and singing, we’re truly excited to be involved in such a wonderful initiative. \r\n\r\nThrough our work as ARCANA PROJECT, we’ve come to feel that what matters most isn’t technical skill, but the joy of singing while making eye contact, the comfort of shared breath, and the freedom to express music from the heart. Discovering your own voice and connecting with others through song are deeply meaningful and precious experiences. \r\n\r\nWe hope this project brings those same experiences to many people. We can’t wait to hear your voices.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ivBlGhJhfPc\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t<h2>About ChoieL</h2>\r\nThe anime song choir project “ChoieL” was launched on June 1, 2022, with the aim of bringing together the beloved tradition of choir and the world of anime songs.

Many of these popular anime titles originate from light novels. At KADOKAWA, we are constantly seeking new talent to create the next big hit. Amid this trend, an increasing number of stories styled after Japanese light novels are being posted on overseas novel submission platforms. These platforms are emerging as hubs for content and creators with the potential to achieve widespread success not only in Japan but around the world.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn response to this global trend, KADOKAWA has launched the Global UGC Publishing Project as part of its Global Business Acceleration Program, which supports new business ventures targeting international markets. This project aims to discover global talent through overseas novel platforms and bring “internationally-born” light novels to audiences both in Japan and worldwide.\r\n\t\r\nThe MyAnimeList x Honeyfeed Writing Contest 2025 – THE ISEKAI presented by KADOKAWA marks the first step in this initiative. Moving forward, the project will expand through initiatives such as a Traditional Chinese writing contest hosted on KadoKado - the novel serialization platform operated by KADOKAWA TAIWAN CORPORATION - as well as the publication of selected winning titles from the JNC Original Light Novel Contest organized by M12 Media LLC.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Contest Information</h2>\r\nEntry fee: Free\r\nWriting platform: Honeyfeed\r\nVoting platform: MyAnimeList\r\nNovel entry period: July 7 to September 29, 2025\r\nJudges voting period: September 30 to November 16, 2025\r\nPublic voting period (Finals): November 17 to December 15, 2025\r\nWinners announced: February 9, 2026\r\n\t\r\n\t<h3>Prizes</h3>\r\nGrand Prize — $5,000 USD\r\nWinners: 1 \r\nYour novel will be scheduled for publication by KADOKAWA in Japan as a light novel, subject to KADOKAWA’s final approval.\r\nImportant: The Grand Prize may not be awarded if no submission meets the standards for publication.\r\n\r\nContest Winners Prize — $3,000 USD\r\nWinners: 2 winners; or 3 if no Grand Prize is selected\r\nYou might be offered publication of your novel in Japanese by KADOKAWA in Japan as a light novel.\r\nFor complete contest details, submission guidelines, and updates, visit <a href=\"https://mhwc.myanimelist.net/202507\">mhwc.myanimelist.net/202507</a>.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>About KADOKAWA CORPORATION</h2>\r\nKADOKAWA Group, a comprehensive entertainment company, develops a wide range of businesses such as Publication, Animation, Film, Gaming, Web services, and Education/EdTech.

This new series shifts the stage to both shokugan and gashapon markets for a fresh rollout. \r\n\r\nAnticipation was high from the start of online pre-orders, and the product officially launched in May 2025. Featuring highly detailed figures and a wide variety of interchangeable parts, the line gives users the freedom to play and customize according to their preferences.

When I imagined the moment of meeting someone, it felt like a rush of heat sweeping through my heart, creating an aurora. It was something like a solar flare. That feeling is what inspired me as I wrote “Yuwanamerou.”\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Mekakushe’s Profile</h2>\r\nHandling lyrics, composition, vocals, and piano performance by herself, the next-generation singer-songwriter Mekakushe enjoys immense popularity among artists and creators. Starting classical piano at the age of three, she gradually gravitated towards pop music. Her independently produced songs were featured in a Kao Laurier commercial, and she was one of the top artists on the Spotify official playlist “Kirakira Pop Japan” with a total of 3 million plays. She is a promising emerging artist with anticipated future success. With electronica as the foundation in her recordings, her musical style continues to expand, featuring classical solos and band sets in live performances.\r\n\r\nOfficial YouTube channel: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@_mekakushe_\">youtube.com/@_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_mekakushe_\">twitter.com/_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_mekakushe_\">instagram.com/_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial TikTok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@_mekakushe_\">tiktok.com/@_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial homepage: <a href=\"https://www.mekakushe.com\">mekakushe.com</a>\t\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

The same content will be performed across all three scheduled performances.\r\n\r\nLaunched in September 2017, Hypnosis Mic -Division Rap Battle- is a music-based rap project featuring original characters. Eighteen distinctive main characters are divided into six teams, engaging in intense rap battles. The rap music is created by leading rappers and producers from Japan’s hip-hop scene, with voice actors performing the raps to bring each character’s story to life through music.\r\n\r\nBlending character-driven music with narrative-rich audio dramas, the franchise has expanded into comics, mobile games, stage plays, and anime. The 3DCG live show HYPED-UP features fully 3D-rendered characters performing live, offering an immersive experience that makes the characters feel real.\r\n\r\nOn February 21, 2025, the franchise released the film Hypnosis Mic -Division Rap Battle-. As Japan’s first interactive film—where the story and ending change based on audience votes during each screening—it achieved remarkable box office success, surpassing 1.7 billion yen.\r\n\r\nHypnosis Mic Homepage: <a href=\"https://hypnosismic.com\">hypnosismic.com</a>\r\nHypnosis Mic Official X: <a href=\"https://x.com/hypnosismic\">x.com/hypnosismic</a>\t\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

She seeks help from Santa Claus to find her friend Ono, who suddenly went missing. To break the curse and revive the sealed Santa, she threatens Sanda with a deadly blade.\r\n\r\n\t<b>Comment</b>\r\n1. How did you feel when you were cast as Fuyumura in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?\r\nMeeting Shiori Fuyumura during the audition was such a powerful experience that it feels like she’s become a constant presence in my life. I poured everything I have into this role. I’d be thrilled if SANDA reaches a wide audience.\r\n\r\n2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?\r\nA liver so strong that it can handle any alcohol.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h3>Ichie Ono (Voiced by Anna Nagase)</h3>\r\nA classmate of Sanda and best friend of Fuyumura. She suddenly disappeared from their class, and her whereabouts remain unknown. The school considers her dead, but Fuyumura is determined to search for her with Santa Claus’ help.\r\n\r\n\t<b>Comment</b>\r\n1. How did you feel when you were cast as Ono in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?\r\nOno was a role that really challenged me. I struggled a lot while developing the character, and I constantly felt a sense of anxiety and tightness in my chest. I hope that feeling comes through in Ono’s portrayal. Please look forward to the broadcast!\r\n\r\n2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?\r\nWhen I was a kid, I was always the one receiving presents, so this time, I’d like to give something back. Maybe I could help out? Like riding in the sleigh with Santa and delivering presents around town! That sounds like fun.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h3>Hitoshi Amaya (Voiced by Yuuki Shin)</h3>\r\nSanda’s roommate, also known as “Prince Amaya.” He is one of the few who know Santa Claus’ secret and wants him to return to fulfill an important wish.\r\n\r\n\t<b>Comment</b>\r\n1. How did you feel when you were cast as Amaya in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?\r\nI’m really excited to be voicing Amaya in SANDA. I enjoyed bringing out his mysterious charm through my performance. This story really makes you reflect on what it means to be an adult. It’s a wonderful series, so please be sure to watch it!\r\n\r\n2. Since this is an action series featuring Santa Claus, is there anything you’d want to ask him for?\r\nI’d love to ask Santa Claus for a Nintendo Switch 2. Even if I don’t get one, just a chance to win the pre-order lottery would be great. I’ve been good, so please! I’d like to play racing games on it!\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Nico Kazao (Voiced by Misato Matsuoka)</h3>\r\nSanda’s fiancée, chosen by the country from birth. She’s a realist who wants to rebel a little before becoming a “responsible adult.” She always acts freely and often swears.\r\n\r\n\t<b>Comment</b>\r\n1. How did you feel when you were cast as Nico in SANDA? And what message do you have for fans looking forward to the series?\r\nWhen I first learned about Nico, I was deeply captivated by her complete freedom from any constraints.

This new series, titled “TB-02: The Ghost in the Shell,” is based on Shirow Masamune’s legendary cyberpunk series The Ghost in the Shell.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>“TechnoByobu” is an art piece of a new era that reimagines the works of internationally and domestically acclaimed artists as folding screens made from wafer-thin golden brass leaves, a craft that has been handed down in Japan for over 500 years. The artworks, vividly depicted in vibrant colors on folding screens made entirely of golden brass leaf, have attracted attention as a fusion of traditional and modern art. The first piece, “TB-01: Electronic Fan Girl,” which was inspired by the album artwork of YMO (Yellow Magic Orchestra), generated significant buzz.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>“TB-02: The Ghost in the Shell,” based on the world-famous science fiction work The Ghost in the Shell (Shirow Masamune/Kodansha), utilizes the physical medium of a folding screen with cybernetic visuals, creating a next-generation visual that merges past and future.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Scheduled for release in 2026 as part of a series themed around traditional Japanese elegance, the first work in the series boldly features Motoko Kusanagi and the Fuchikoma from Shirow Masamune’s original 1991 manga, on a golden brass leaf background.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Prior to the release, U/M/A/A will unveil the first prototype of the series at Design Shanghai 2025 (<a href=\"https://www.designshanghai.com/\">designshanghai.com</a>) to be held in Shanghai, China, from June 4, 2025.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>TechnoByobu Second Installment TB-02: The Ghost in the Shell</h2>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h3>️TechnoByobu Second Installment</h3>\r\nNumber: TB-02\r\nTitle: The Ghost in the Shell\r\nArtist: Shirow Masamune\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Product Overview</h3>\r\nTechnoByobu Official Website: <a href=\"https://technobyobu.jp/\">technobyobu.jp</a>\r\nRelease Date: Scheduled for 2026 \r\nThis piece will be offered as a limited edition, accompanied by a unique serial number.\r\nIf you are considering a purchase, please register through the Customer Service form on the official website. Priority information will be sent to registered customers.\r\nCustomer Service form: <a href=\"https://technobyobu.jp/cs\">technobyobu.jp/cs</a>\r\n\r\nSize:\r\nHeight: 59.05 inches (1,500 mm)\r\nWidth: 55.12 inches (1,400 mm)\r\nWeight: 8.8 pounds (4 kg)\r\nMaterial: Golden Brass Leaf\r\nPrinting Method: Archival Pigment Print\r\nTechnique: Kasane Graphica Multi-Layered Pigment Transfer Technique\r\nPrice: TBD\r\nSeries Concept: A lineup of distinct pieces infused with the elegance and spirit of Japan.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>What is TechnoByobu?</h2>\t\r\nTechnoByobu’s “techno” originates from the Greek word téchnē, meaning art, technique, or skill. It embodies more than just practical know-how; it’s a philosophical concept that encompasses the intelligence and creativity behind craftsmanship, as well as the futuristic expression of electronic music. Rooted in this background, “techno” is not only the origin of the word “technology” but also a layered term that blends cultural and artistic innovation.\r\nBased on this philosophy, TechnoByobu is composed of three elements:\r\n・Artwork that evokes futurism (art)\r\n・Byobu (folding screens), a traditional Japanese craft kept alive by artisans (skill)\r\n・Digital certificates guaranteed by technology (technique)\r\n\r\nBy overlapping these elements, TechnoByobu culminates as an art piece that expresses the multifaceted nature of “Techno.” Moving forward, it will continue to explore new possibilities of expression in collaboration with diverse talents both in Japan and abroad.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About The Ghost in the Shell</h2>\t\r\n“The Ghost in the Shell” is a science fiction manga series written by manga artist Shirow Masamune, which began serialization in 1989, in Kodansha’s “Young Magazine Pirate Edition.”\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Motoko Kusanagi, a full-body cyborg with exceptional skill in both cyber and conventional warfare. With the rank of Major, she leads the aggressive unit “Shell Squad” as they confront highly intricate and sinister crimes. With its realistic art style, the series’ narrative explores the fusion of humans and technology, delving into cyberpunk elements and philosophical themes, while deeply examining topics such as personal identity.\r\n\r\nThe series has been expanded into various forms including theatrical and TV animations, as well as games. Each of these adaptations offers its own unique story, interpretations, and expressions, distinct from the original manga.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Unveiling of the prototype at Design Shanghai — the World’s First Public Exhibition</h2>\r\nDesign Shanghai is one of the world’s most prestigious international design events and a driving force in the new frontier-breaking Chinese design world. In 2024, they invited more than 600 brands from 40 countries worldwide to exhibit new products and hold specially organized events. \r\n\r\nAt this year’s 2025 Design Shanghai, starting June 4, TechnoByobu’s second installment, “TB-02: The Ghost in the Shell,” will be unveiled to the world for the very first time. During the exhibition, visitors will have the opportunity to see the prototype up close.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TechnoByobu-Booth-at-Design-Shanghai-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h3>Exhibition Information</h3> \r\nDesign Shanghai 2025 \r\nDate: June 4th-7th, 2025 \r\nVenue: Shanghai Expo Hall 3 “Beyond Craft Japan” 3F81 \r\n<a href=\"https://www.designshanghai.com\">designshanghai.com</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About Rekiseisha</h2>\r\nIn its founding year of 1905, Rekiseisha developed a groundbreaking scientific technique that had never been seen before: foil-pressed paper using brass leaf that was just as beautiful as the traditional gold foil (hon-kinpaku) but far more resistant to discoloration over time.

Both “BRIGHT EYES” and “Missing Link” are songs about the importance of believing in yourself. I hope these songs plant a seed of courage in your heart.\r\n\r\n<h2>Profile </h2>\r\nA powerhouse rock singer who captivates fans with his distinctive voice and magnetic charisma.

Additionally, the music video for their new song “DESTINEX,” which began pre-release streaming on May 21, was released on their official YouTube channel.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>INSIGNIA, set for release on June 18, marks PassCode’s first album under their current lineup and their first new album in about four and a half years. The national tour to promote the album will cover 13 shows across 12 cities nationwide and serves as an important lead-up to their long-awaited arena concert, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX,” scheduled for November.\r\n</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>PassCode’s Yokohama BayHall show kicked off what promises to be an intense year. From the first song, the energy was high both on stage and in the crowd. The members were surprised by the strong reaction to their new pre-release song’s debut performance. With a refreshed setlist, the four delivered a determined show pushing beyond “the other side of destiny,” and the 1,100-strong audience packed into the venue responded enthusiastically. This night suggested the entire tour could be their best yet!</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>PassCode’s new album INSIGNIA is set to become a defining work for the group. It includes a carefully chosen selection of popular songs released since Emiri Arima joined, along with six powerful new tracks led by “DESTINEX,” making a total of 12 songs. To celebrate the release, special events are planned in four cities: Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Fukuoka.

They have a versatile repertoire based on a band sound, punctuated by their distinctive shouts and screams, and have performed at numerous major festivals such as SUMMER SONIC and ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL, earning broad support from both rock enthusiasts and idol fans.\r\n\r\nAfter making their major debut in 2016, they released their first international album Ex Libris PassCode in America, Europe, and Canada under the UK’s JPU Records in October 2018. The track “Ichikabachika” from their 2019 album CLARITY was selected as the opening theme for the TV drama Kakegurui season 2 and the movie Kakegurui. In 2020, their single “STARRY SKY,” which was chosen as the theme song for the drama 182 Days Left, earned them their first-ever No. 1 on the Oricon Weekly Single Chart and Billboard JAPAN Weekly Single Chart. They also made their debut appearance on Nippon Broadcasting System’s All Night Nippon 0.\r\n\r\nIn February 2022, they held their first concert at Nippon Budokan. In 2023, they embarked on their first US tour, “PassCode US / JAPAN TOUR 2023 -GROUNDSWELL-,” which included stops in Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, as well as 11 cities and 12 venues in Japan. In June 2024, they moved to Bandai Namco Music Live. Their September release “WILLSHINE” was chosen as the OP theme for season 2 of the anime SHY, and their new song “SKILLAWAKE” was selected as the OP theme for season 2 of As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I’ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World. Looking ahead, their first arena concert in about three years, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX”, is scheduled for November 2025.\r\n\r\nOfficial website: <a href=\"https://passcode-official.com\">passcode-official.com</a>\r\nOfficial fan club “Linkage” website: <a href=\"https://fannect.jp/passcode-linkage\">fannect.jp/passcode-linkage</a>\r\n\r\nSocial Media:\r\nX: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/passcodeo\">twitter.com/passcodeo</a>\r\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PASSCODE0000\">youtube.com/user/PASSCODE0000</a>\r\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PassCodeOfficial/\">facebook.com/PassCodeOfficial</a>\r\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/passcodeo\">instagram.com/passcodeo</a>\t\t\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

The end result is a vibrant, heartfelt pop number that’s bursting with colorful stars.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\thttps://youtu.be/wFYG8hFPYHw\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Product Information</h2>\r\nDigital Single\r\nmekakushe “Watashi Dake no Polaris”\r\nLyrics/Composition: mekakushe　\r\nArrangement: Ryohei Sakata (Hifumi Inc.)\r\n\r\nOn streaming websites: <a href=\"https://linkco.re/UeehU5YZ\">linkco.re/UeehU5YZ</a>\r\nLyric video (TV size): <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wFYG8hFPYHw\">youtu.be/wFYG8hFPYHw</a>\r\nOfficial audio: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZdH3hmUo8ek\">youtu.be/ZdH3hmUo8ek</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Mekakushe’s Comment</h2>\r\nThis song is meant to be a kind of good luck charm. Just like the stars at night, songs can have a distant feeling to them because of how brightly they shine. So, I wrote “Watashi Dake no Polaris” with those thoughts in mind. Even on days when they’re hidden behind the clouds, stars still twinkle with the same intensity. I always want to stare at the special person right beside me, because their brilliant light means I’ll never feel alone!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Mekakushe’s Profile</h2>\r\nHandling lyrics, composition, vocals, and piano performance by herself, the next-generation singer-songwriter Mekakushe enjoys immense popularity among artists and creators. Starting classical piano at the age of three, she gradually gravitated towards pop music. Her independently produced songs were featured in a Kao Laurier commercial, and she was one of the top artists on the Spotify official playlist “Kirakira Pop Japan” with a total of 3 million plays. She is a promising emerging artist with anticipated future success. With electronica as the foundation in her recordings, her musical style continues to expand, featuring classical solos and band sets in live performances.\r\n\t\r\nOfficial YouTube channel: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@_mekakushe_\">youtube.com/@_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_mekakushe_\">x.com/_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_mekakushe_\">instagram.com/_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial TikTok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@_mekakushe_\">tiktok.com/@_mekakushe_</a>\r\nOfficial webpage: <a href=\"https://www.mekakushe.com\">mekakushe.com</a>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

To mark the occasion, streaming of character songs, the original soundtrack, and the Season 2 ending theme from the TV anime Nobunaga the Fool began on May 23, 2025.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Nobunaga the Fool is an original anime created by Shoji Kawamori—who also serves as special advisor at Satelight Inc.—and features his work as series composer and chief director. The show drew attention as a grand sci-fi Sengoku epic where legendary figures from East and West battle using armor-like mobile weapons called “Ikusa Yoroi.” The project also attracted attention for its innovative “multidimensional” approach, linking the anime with stage productions. The series continues to have a loyal fanbase to this day.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The character song collection includes six volumes in total, starting with Vol. 1 Oda Nobunaga (CV: Mamoru Miyano) and Vol. 2 Toyotomi Hideyoshi (CV: Yuki Kaji). These must-listen tracks bring to life powerful characters surviving in a war-torn world.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The original soundtrack is composed by Masaru Yokoyama, known for his work on Mashle and Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans. The Season 2 ending theme, “Ran,” performed by ASUKA, features a powerful yet delicate vocal performance that captures the show’s emotional depth and highlights its characters’ inner struggles.</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>Together with the already-released opening theme “FOOL THE WORLD” by Minori Chihara, ending theme “AXIS” by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION, and Season 2 opening theme “Breakthrough” by JAM Project, fans can now enjoy the full lineup of Nobunaga the Fool’s memorable music on streaming services.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Songs Released for Streaming</h2>\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Season 2 Ending Theme “Ran” / ASUKA\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Character Song Vol. 1 Oda Nobunaga (CV: Mamoru Miyano)\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Character Song Vol. 2 Toyotomi Hideyoshi (CV: Yuki Kaji)\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Character Song Vol. 3 Jeanne Kaguya d’Arc (CV: Yoko Hikasa)\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Character Song Vol. 4 Ichihime (CV: Minori Chihara)\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Character Song Vol. 5 Himiko (CV: Nao Toyama)\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Character Song Vol. 6 Gaius Julius Caesar (CV: Yuichi Nakamura)\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Original Soundtrack Vol. 1 / Masaru Yokoyama\r\nTV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Original Soundtrack Vol. 2 / Masaru Yokoyama\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Streaming Services</h2>\r\nApple Music\r\nSpotify\r\nLINE MUSIC\r\nAmazon Music Unlimited\r\nYouTube Music\r\netc.\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Related Songs</h2>\r\n\t<b>TV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Opening Theme “FOOL THE WORLD” / Minori Chihara</b>\r\nMusic Video\r\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Rf5YE7Fb4xc\">youtu.be/Rf5YE7Fb4xc</a>\r\nOn Music Streaming Services\r\n<a href=\"https://lnk.to/LACM-14198d\">lnk.to/LACM-14198d</a>\r\n\r\n\t<b>TV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Ending Theme “AXIS” / STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION</b>\r\nMusic Video\r\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3EosbtvgNAw\">youtu.be/3EosbtvgNAw</a>\r\nOn Music Streaming Services\r\n<a href=\"https://lnk.to/LACM-14186d\">lnk.to/LACM-14186d</a>\r\n\r\n\t<b>TV Anime Nobunaga the Fool Season 2 Opening Theme “Breakthrough” / JAM Project</b>\r\nMusic Video\r\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Jb2M8e0Ltg0\">youtu.be/Jb2M8e0Ltg0</a>\r\nOn Music Streaming Services\r\n<a href=\"https://jamproject.lnk.to/Breakthrough\">jamproject.lnk.to/Breakthrough</a>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

Ahead of the release, one of the new tracks, “DESTINEX,” is now available on various music streaming platforms (released on May 21). In addition, the album’s cover artwork and full tracklist have been revealed.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>“DESTINEX” also serves as the title song for PassCode’s long-awaited arena concert, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX,” scheduled for November. The title conveys the meaning of “beyond a predetermined fate.” Before the song was produced, the group launched a sing-along project, gathering voices from fans around the world. Their passionate chorus is featured in the track, creating a powerful collaboration between the members and their fans.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The full album INSIGNIA includes standout tracks such as “Freely / FLAVOR OF BLUE,” which left a strong impression following Emily Arima’s addition to the group in August 2021, along with live staples like “Clouds Across The Moon” and “GROUNDSWELL.” Also featured are “WILLSHINE,” the opening theme for the second season of the anime SHY, and “SKILLAWAKE,” the opening theme for the second season of As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I’ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World. In addition to the lead “DESTINEX,” the album also includes five powerful new songs: “MIRAGE WALKER,” “VIRIVIRI,” “One Time Only,” “A certain Motor-Heart is not working right!” and “Echoes.” There’s no doubt this album marks a new pinnacle in PassCode’s career.</li>\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CNRXQ3x1FQ\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Product Information</h2>\r\n“DESTINEX”\r\nAdd / Save: <a href=\"https://lnk.to/LZC-3045d\">lnk.to/LZC-3045d</a>\r\nReleased on music streaming and download websites on May 21\r\n\r\nNew Album\r\nTitle: INSIGNIA\r\nRelease Date: June 18, 2025\r\n\r\nFormats\r\nLimited First Edition (CD + Blu-ray)\r\nPrice: ¥9,350 (incl. tax)\r\nStandard Edition (CD only)\r\nPrice: ¥3,300 (incl. tax)\r\n\r\n\t<!-- options -->\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\t<div class=\"inline-block\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"img-shadow\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PassCode-INSIGNIA-Standard-Edition-Cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"560\" class=\"aligncenter size-width-560 wp-image-359465\" />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" cdj_product_id=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /options -->\r\n\t\r\nTracklist\r\nCD\r\n1.

They have a versatile repertoire based on a band sound, punctuated by their distinctive shouts and screams, and have performed at numerous major festivals such as SUMMER SONIC and ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL, earning broad support from both rock enthusiasts and idol fans.\r\n\r\nAfter making their major debut in 2016, they released their first international album Ex Libris PassCode in America, Europe, and Canada under the UK’s JPU Records in October 2018. The track “Ichikabachika” from their 2019 album CLARITY was selected as the opening theme for the TV drama Kakegurui season 2 and the movie Kakegurui. In 2020, their single “STARRY SKY,” which was chosen as the theme song for the drama 182 Days Left, earned them their first-ever No. 1 on the Oricon Weekly Single Chart and Billboard JAPAN Weekly Single Chart. They also made their debut appearance on Nippon Broadcasting System’s All Night Nippon 0.\r\n\r\nIn February 2022, they held their first concert at Nippon Budokan. In 2023, they embarked on their first US tour, “PassCode US / JAPAN TOUR 2023 -GROUNDSWELL-,” which included stops in Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, as well as 11 cities and 12 venues in Japan. In June 2024, they moved to Bandai Namco Music Live. Their September release “WILLSHINE” was chosen as the OP theme for season 2 of the anime SHY, and their new song “SKILLAWAKE” was selected as the OP theme for season 2 of As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I’ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World. Looking ahead, their first arena concert in about three years, PassCode YOKOHAMA BUNTAI 2025 “DESTINEX”, is scheduled for November 2025.\r\n\r\nOfficial website: <a href=\"https://passcode-official.com\">passcode-official.com</a>\r\nOfficial fan club “Linkage” website: <a href=\"https://fannect.jp/passcode-linkage\">fannect.jp/passcode-linkage</a>\r\n\r\nSocial Media:\r\nX: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/passcodeo\">twitter.com/passcodeo</a>\r\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PASSCODE0000\">youtube.com/user/PASSCODE0000</a>\r\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PassCodeOfficial/\">facebook.com/PassCodeOfficial</a>\r\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/passcodeo\">instagram.com/passcodeo</a>\t\t\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

The title track serves as the opening theme for the TV anime Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra: World Conquest Starts with the Civilization of Ruin, which premieres in July 2025.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra is a nation-building fantasy series that follows Takuto Ira, a legendary player who once topped the user rankings in Eternal Nations, a nation-management simulation game set in a fantasy world. While hospitalized, he loses consciousness and wakes up in Idragia, a world that feels just like the game. Thus begins a tale of fantasy and empire-building.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>“Majestic Catastrophe,” the anime’s opening theme, builds on Sasaki’s signature rock sound while venturing into new territory with a symphonic metal style that reflects the anime’s world. The powerful, dramatic track is matched by Sasaki’s commanding vocals.</li> \r\n\r\n<li>The single includes three songs: the title track “Majestic Catastrophe” and two additional tracks, one featuring lyrics written by Sasaki herself.\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment from Rico Sasaki</h2>\r\nI’ll be performing “Majestic Catastrophe,” the opening theme for the TV anime Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra: World Conquest Starts with the Civilization of Ruin! It’s a dark and beautiful song that brings a sense of catharsis. I sang powerfully to reflect its pressing intensity, and delicately, as if searching for hope in the darkness. The heavy chorus, along with lyrics and a melody that evoke an ominous atmosphere, all work together to draw listeners into the depths of a dark musical world. “Majestic Catastrophe” stirs emotions deep within—get ready to be hooked by its irresistible darkness.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Product Information</h2>\r\nTitle: Majestic Catastrophe (OP Theme of Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra: World Conquest Starts with the Civilization of Ruin)\r\nArtist: Rico Sasaki\r\nRelease Date: August 27, 2025\r\n\r\nArtist Edition\r\nProduct No.: LACM-24740 (CD + BD)\r\nPrice: ¥3,300 (tax incl.)\r\nLabel: Bandai Namco Music Live Inc.\r\nDistributor: Bandai Namco Filmworks Inc.\r\n\r\nAnime Edition\r\nProduct No.: LACM-24741 (CD only)\r\nPrice: ¥3,300 (tax incl.)\r\nLabel: Bandai Namco Music Live Inc.\r\nDistributor: Bandai Namco Filmworks Inc.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\nCD\r\n1.Majestic Catastrophe\r\nLyrics: Erica Masaki\r\nComposition/Arrangement: Ash Inoue (Dream Monster)\r\nAnd two other original songs\r\n\r\nBlu-ray\r\n1.

The first disc will be a collection of 14 opening and ending themes from the anime, the second disc a compilation of 13 insert songs, and the third disc will feature an original collection of songs on piano by pianist and producer Mina Kubota.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>In 2009, ARIA The BOX, a collection of themes and insert songs from the anime, was released with only 10,000 copies available which sold out immediately. The new best-hits album will be the only item once again featuring the complete collection of themes and insert songs from the anime, so you don’t want to miss out.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The album jacket illustration features original artwork by the creator Kozue Amano.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>In addition, the second main visual for ARIA’s 20th anniversary concert has been released.

She continues to bring fresh energy to the VTuber and anime music scene in 2025, with events like her online 3D live concert “Flap” on her YouTube channel on March 27.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Her 3rd single, “Twinkle Twinkle Little Wing,” marks the conclusion of her three-month release streak. The song was composed by Mamoru (nhhmbase), who is known for his contributions to idol groups like You’ll Melt More! and Lyrical School, as well as games such as Taiko no Tatsujin. The illustration is a pixel art piece by ahiru-hitsuji, who has also produced music videos for Nijisanji VTuber Suo Sango.</li>\r\n\t\r\n\t<li>Step into a new frontier of the yami-kawa world, where catchy yet unexpected melodies intertwine with a colorful fusion of electronic sounds, strings, and electric guitar, crafting a richly layered and fantastical soundscape.</li>\r\n\r\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTL-JWQ8Dc\r\n\r\n\tOn Music Services: <a href=\"https://lnk.to/LZC-3013\">lnk.to/LZC-3013</a>\r\nSinger: Kurone Yousagi\r\nLyrics/Composition/Arrangement: Mamoru (nhhmbase)\r\nIllustration: ahiru-hitsuji\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Kurone Yousagi Online 3D Concert “Flap”</h2>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QsA4620aFo\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Comment from Kurone Yousagi</h2>\r\n“Twinkle Twinkle Little Wing” is my third original song! Personally, I think it’s going to be perfect for live performances—I’ve got high expectations! The part I really want you to notice is right before the chorus when I go, “Wah!” in a mischievous kind of way! It’s a classic, high-energy track that anyone can vibe to, so listen to it a ton! Got it?!\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>About Kurone Yousagi</h2>\r\nA yami-kawa tsundere VTuber affiliated with MEWLIVE and the “cousin” of voice actress Nozomi Suzuhara.\r\n\r\nKurone is a second-year high school student (currently repeating the year) who adores all things with a sickly-cute aesthetic. While she has a tsundere personality, she occasionally reveals a softer side to those she trusts. She refers to herself as a “lady” and claims to live in a grand mansion, but the reality is...?\r\n\r\nAs a 1st-generation member of MEWLIVE, a VTuber production operated by Bandai Namco Music Live Co., Ltd., Kurone made her major debut under the company’s Lantis label in 2025. She has also announced three consecutive months of music releases, further expanding her activities.\r\n\r\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Kurone_Yousagi\">youtube.com/@Kurone_Yousagi</a>\r\nX (formerly Twitter): <a href=\"https://x.com/Yousagi_Kurone\">x.com/Yousagi_Kurone</a>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",

For 2025, the project continues to serve as a cultural bridge between creators, publishers, and readers in <b>over 240 countries and territories</b>.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>As an added incentive, MyAnimeList users who read 2 volumes of any title from the 2025 list during the campaign period will earn a time-limited profile badge.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About “You Should Read This Manga 2025”?</h2>\r\nA unique global manga promotion project carried out by world-renowned anime and manga community MyAnimeList in conjunction with industry professionals. The project is the first of its kind, using online nominations from users around the world to produce the ultimate list of manga recommendations for that year. Aside from the main category, “You Should Read This Manga,” the project includes a number of sub-categories, including series that fans would like to see animated.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Categories & Criteria</h2>\r\n\tThis global manga discovery project was launched with the goal of inspiring fans around the world to explore lesser-known but highly recommended titles. The final list is created from <b>user-submitted nominations</b>, which allows fans to vote for up to 10 titles and include persuasive reasoning for why each title should be featured. Titles must have seen an overseas release in 2024, and have a Score and Popularity ranking below #50 on MyAnimeList to be eligible for nomination. The 2025 edition includes four curated categories:\r\n \r\n\t<b>You Should read This Manga 2025</b>\r\nFor manga that readers simply really want to recommend to a friend!  \r\n (e.g. Gachiakuta, Magus of the Library, Kagurabachi)\r\n \r\n\t<b>Should Be Anime</b>\r\nFor manga not adapted into anime within the past 5 years. (e.g. Gokurakugai, Kindergarten Wars, Firefly Wedding)\r\n \r\n\t<b>Best for Beginners</b>\r\nFor new readers; short, accessible, or recently adapted into anime. (e.g. Dandadan, Smoking Behind the Supermarket with You, RuriDragon)\r\n \r\n\t<b>Unique Art/Story</b>\r\nFor seasoned manga fans seeking originality in artwork or narrative. (e.g. Veil, Kaiju Girl Caramelise, The Color of the End: Mission in the Apocalypse)\r\n\r\nExplore the full list of selected works here: <a href=\"https://mxj.myanimelist.net/readthismanga/2025/nomination\">mxj.myanimelist.net/readthismanga/2025/nomination</a>\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Trends from This Year’s List</h2>\t\r\n\t\r\n\t<b>Demographic Balance</b>: Half of the selected titles were originally published in shounen or seinen magazines. Notably, one in four of these titles received more votes from female readers.\r\n\t<b>Digital Origins</b>: 25% of the titles come from web-based manga platforms such as Shonen Jump+ or Manga UP.\r\n\t<b>Anime Demand</b>: Over half the “Should Be Anime” picks are shounen, with two-thirds of these available for free via MANGA Plus.\r\n\t<b>Female Reader Influence</b>: The “Unique Art/Story” list saw the majority of votes come from female users, in contrast to the other lists.\r\n\t<b>Breakout Titles</b>: Girls love/yuri manga The Guy She Was Interested in Wasn't a Guy at All had total nominations almost equal to all GL titles combined from the previous year.

The full-length version of its opening theme, “Sugosugi Maebashi Witches!”, is now available for streaming. Performed by the Maebashi Witches, a five-member voice actor idol group portraying the anime’s main characters, the song features lyrics by Tsunku♂, composition by TORIENA, and arrangement by Yuki Kishida.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Blending the classic sound of the Japanese idol scene with infectious refrains, powerful kicks, and deep bass, this track is also a perfect fit for anime club playlists. Don’t miss it!\r\n</li>\t\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEYDX-VF974\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Creator Comments:</h2>\r\n\t<b>Lyrics: Tsunku♂</b>\r\nI think everyone has childhood memories of playing flower fortune-telling—plucking petals one by one, eagerly anticipating the final answer. Even with only two possible outcomes, it always felt exciting.\r\n\r\nWith that theme in mind, I wove the cast members’ names and various types of flowers into the melody to create this song. Writing the lyrics felt like solving a complex jigsaw puzzle—I was so immersed that time just flew by. \r\n\r\nThe protagonists are adorable, and with a story full of youthful passion and a sense of achievement, I’m really looking forward to watching the show.\r\n\r\n\t<b>Composition: TORIENA</b>\r\nI composed this song with the hope that each member of the Maebashi Witches would shine brightly. I think it’s a lively and adorable track. Super amazing Maebashi Witches!\r\n\r\n\t<b>Arrangement: Yuki Kishida</b>\r\nCongratulations on the full-length release! First and foremost, I’m truly honored to have been part of this project. I still remember how excited I was when I first received the demo—it was already amazing. As I worked on it, I kept thinking about how I could contribute to make it even better. My goal was to create a sound that you’d want to hear anywhere—on TV, through your phone, or even in a club. I hope people enjoy it in all kinds of places!\r\n\r\n\t<h2>Release Information</h2>\r\nTo commemorate the Maebashi Witches special stage event at AnimeJapan 2025 on March 22, the full-size version of the opening theme “Sugosugi Maebashi Witches!” is now available for early streaming!\r\n\r\n\t<b>TV Anime Maebashi Witches OP Theme “Sugosugi Maebashi Witches!”</b>\r\nRelease Date: March 22, 2025\r\nLabel: Lantis\r\nLyrics: Tsunku\r\nComposition: TORIENA\r\nArrangement: Yuki Kishida\r\n\r\n\t<b>On music streaming services:</b> <a href=\"https://lnk.to/LZC-3031\">lnk.to/LZC-3031</a>\r\n\r\n\t<h2>CD Release Information</h2>\t\r\n<b>TV Anime Maebashi Witches OP Theme/ED Theme \r\n\t“Sugosugi Maebashi Witches!” / “Sorezore no Door” Opening Edition</b>\r\nRelease Date: May 28, 2025\r\nProduct No.: LACM-24687\r\nPrice: ¥1,980 (incl. tax)\r\nLabel: Lantis\r\n\r\n\t<b>Tracks</b>\r\n1.

While many people are already familiar with the countless anime and manga series born in Japan, light novels, which often serve as their source material, remain lesser-known. This is partly due to the lack of widespread translations. Through NOVELOUS, Shogakukan, one of Japan’s leading publishers, will introduce North American readers to light novels that have yet to gain wide recognition, offering translations directly from the source.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About MyAnimeList</h2>\r\nMyAnimeList is one of the world’s largest communities and databases for Japanese anime and manga, with 16 million registered members from 240 countries and regions worldwide. An indispensable site for tracking anime and manga progress, it holds over 1.2 billion records of viewing and reading big data. Founded in 2004, MyAnimeList has become a crucial source of information for overseas fans, especially among Generation Z in North America.\r\n\r\n\t<h2>About Honeyfeed</h2>\r\nHoneyfeed is a leading writing platform that empowers authors to create, share, and engage with their original stories. With a vibrant community of readers and writers, Honeyfeed provides an immersive space for storytelling across various genres, including anime and manga-inspired narratives.\t\r\n\t\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"text-right\"><i class=\"fa fa-fw fa-search-plus\"></i>[en]Source: [/en][es]Fuente: [/es]Official Press Release</p>\r\n\r\n[ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]",
