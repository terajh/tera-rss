        &lt;p&gt;Honey Lemon Soda&amp;#160;arrived quietly but left a lasting impression. Instead of exaggerated drama, the anime leaned into emotional realism, self-growth, and gentle romance. After the conclusion of the first season, viewers are now asking the same question everywhere:&amp;#160;Will Honey Lemon Soda have a Season 2? As interest continues to grow, here is a complete and [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Dan Da Dan&amp;#160;has never played it safe.

        &lt;p&gt;Blue Exorcist&amp;#160;has never followed a smooth release path. The anime’s history has been shaped by long gaps, restructured story arcs, and careful returns rather than annual seasons.

        &lt;p&gt;Medalist&amp;#160;emerged as a sports anime that emphasized process over results. The first season focused on beginnings, training, and emotional groundwork rather than competition outcomes. With the story now moving forward, attention has shifted to how that foundation will be tested as the narrative progresses into a more demanding phase.

        &lt;p&gt;Re:Zero – Starting Life in Another World&amp;#160;has never aimed to be comfortable. Fans connect with it because the anime embraces emotional collapse, harsh consequences, and impossible decisions. Each season pushes Subaru further. After the last arc ended, attention shifted toward what comes next. Season 4 now stands as the series’ most anticipated chapter yet. Re:Zero [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
