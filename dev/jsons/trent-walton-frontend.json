    "title": "Expanding Upon Design Systems",
    "partialText": "&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-if-we-expanded-design-thinking-to-encompass-the-entire-product-development-process&quot;&gt;What if we expanded design thinking to encompass the entire product development process?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Design systems have done wonders for helping organizations build digital products. With a design system in place, visual consistency is easier to maintain, components become reusable, and redundant work is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2022/Design_Systems_Intro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Design Systems graphic showing examples of type, color, and web components.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the right buy-in, design systems can do magical things for team collaboration. When contributors with different specializations (design, engineer, etc.) start looking at the same thing, perceptions align and friction melts away. As teams have become more distributed/remote, it’s more important now than ever to capture this collaborative magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2022/Mission_visual.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A diagram showing design and engineering intersecting.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience, however, most design system management tools focus only on the intersection of design and code. This is likely a result of the amazing work done within the design and engineering community to evangelize and share knowledge about best practices. Why stop here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, while working on various projects at Paravel, we realized that this unified lens and collaboration model should extend to as many aspects of an organization as possible. Looking back at project friction points over the years, we observed that they extended far beyond the design &amp;amp; code space:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Struggle to gain buy-in across the organization and approval from leadership&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Difficulty accessing data from testing, research, performance, and analytics that would inform design decisions&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Significant gaps in knowledge sharing (and preventing knowledge loss) as team members shift roles and turnover happens&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Misalignment of product development and marketing efforts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2022/Mission_visual2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A diagram showing design, engineering, leadership, marketing, research, and testing intersecting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we decided to extend design system thinking to all areas of an organization in order to create something new: &lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com/&quot;&gt;Luro, a &lt;em&gt;product development&lt;/em&gt; system.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- &lt;img class=&quot;logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2022/luro-mark.svg&quot; alt=&quot;luro logo&quot;&gt; --&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2022/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Luro dashboard screenshot&quot; class=&quot;drop-shadow&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Separate from the firehose of chats, tickets, and emails, organizations need a central hub to house and display the most important info about product and process. This info must be easily referenced, self-service, and it must combine information across all specializations and silos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI’m a designer, and Figma is my daily tool. I’m new to the team working on the signup flow. If, on Day One, I could see every component being used in the current flow, page speed insights, KPIs for the redesign, and the testing/prototyping history of the flow over time, I would not only be well equipped to do my work, I’d save hours of everyone’s time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI’m VP of product and spend a lot of time meeting bi-weekly to review status update slide decks from my four direct reports. These meetings help, but I’d also love to make this information self-service. It’d fit my schedule, and I’d feel much more up-to-speed with the status of roadmap objectives and reassured the teams are aligned on goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tools we use (and the info we’ve got readily available) are the lens through which we view our products. We are building Luro to expand that lens so that teams can build together more effectively and with a unified sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll be writing more about Luro in the coming weeks/months. In the meantime, the Luro waitlist is live! Sign up to follow along as we begin to roll things out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://luroapp.com&quot;&gt;luroapp.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;Back in August I decided I wanted to make an instrumental synthwave album. As trying as the Summer was for many of us, I did my best to take advantage of all time w/ my 8 &amp;amp; 10-year-old boys. We hiked, swam, watched borderline-appropriate movies, and generally had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the house we were leasing, my office was right by the long circle driveway. I could hear them outside all day being awesome: racing bikes, climbing trees, busting rocks, sword fighting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their radness set the vibe for the album. We even wrote a brief nine-part sci-fi story that went on to inspire each of the nine tracks. I made each song in order according to the plot and would include the boys in layering in some sound effects and voiceover bits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yay! Here’s &lt;i&gt;Voyager&lt;/i&gt;! Happy listening!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trentwalton.bandcamp.com/releases&quot;&gt;Listen/Buy on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/61HeTfGwQFe1Tx8xgwE8Qg&quot;&gt;Listen on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/1514840789&quot;&gt;Listen on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;figure class=&quot;centered-block&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 9px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/artist/61HeTfGwQFe1Tx8xgwE8Qg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2021/04/Voyager-3000px-MFL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Trent Walton Voyager album cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I continued doing all the things I love for the album artwork: picking fonts (indulging myself here w/ some &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/1907/itc-serif-gothic&quot;&gt;ITC Serif Gothic&lt;/a&gt; for the title) and making (hacking together) 3D graphics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;figure&gt;\n &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2021/04/helmet.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n&lt;/video&gt; \n&lt;figcaption&gt;No idea what I’m doing here, aside from having fun&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;figure&gt;\n &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2021/04/voyager-layers.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n&lt;/video&gt; \n&lt;figcaption&gt;And adding all sorts of textural and color layers to wrap it up&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also put together some Spotify Canvas videos—one for each song. Here’s a quick edit showing them all together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;\n &lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 540px; width: 100%;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2021/04/voyager-canvas-combo-optimized.mp4#t=0.1&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n&lt;/video&gt; \n&lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify Canvas videos for &lt;i&gt;Voyager&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I plan to keep making music. I’ve got a long way to go to gain those &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)&quot;&gt;10,000 hours&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m having a blast. One day I’d love to find myself making soundtrack music for a show/movie. Heck, maybe my kids will hire me when they get that script we wrote into cinematic production. Anyways, Netflix, give us a shout!&lt;/p&gt;",

The theme for this project was to try and not overthink anything. I’m an amateur here, and while I spend lots of time fussing over details with websites, I didn’t want to do the same with the music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rarely edited or revisited songs once they came together, and in Keyser Söze fashion, names came from whatever I saw lying around the office. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/7ukN60ZbDVlw8D3WLKhYSc?si=QrFD4ZRAS2270Ezk1EYJNw&quot;&gt;Rucco&lt;/a&gt;” came from a &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/uploads/2020/05/rucco-maag-shrine.png&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;BOTW Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/4B8r5FlCny4OFlIor5PHff?si=2i57MT9KQbmsPpbM89AhIQ&quot;&gt;Ideals&lt;/a&gt;” came from the Ball jar on my desk, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The process for the album artwork began with developing a color palette. I assembled some warm tones and played with layer-blending a solid pink/beige block to unify things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;figure class=&quot;centered-block&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 9px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2020/05/color-options.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;color option blocks&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Establishing a color palette&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, I built some textures by dramatically scaling up image resolution, transferring images to halftone, and then scaling them back down. Gigabytes later, all I had left to do was play with shapes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;figure class=&quot;centered-block&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 9px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2020/05/monarch-cover-options-sm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Trent Walton Monarch album cover options&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Bunches of options&amp;mdash;butterflies are fun, but a little too on-the-nose&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the beeps.

    "title": "Sherlock Holmes: A Scandal in Bohemia",
    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;~4 years ago, we had a sliver of free time at Paravel, and wanted to experiment with creating an immersive-website-book-thingy for &lt;a href=&quot;https://sherlock.paravelinc.com/&quot;&gt;Sherlock Holmes: A Scandal in Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; complete with a vibey page design, illustrations, animations, and even audio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;figure class=&quot;centered-block&quot;&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2020/02/sherlock-screens.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paravel Sherlock Holmes: A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sherlock.paravelinc.com/&quot;&gt;sherlock.paravelinc.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;h6 id=&quot;why-did-it-take-so-long-to-share-it&quot;&gt;Why did it take so long to share it?&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure we ever called the experiment done, and we certainly could have spent many more  months fretting over all sorts of details. It probably got to a point where the work it’d take to reach the standard we set in our minds far outweighed the joy experienced in the act of creating it. And then we just forgot about it until recently and decided to ship it as-is. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6 id=&quot;ive-heard-you-trash-talk-scroll-jacking-hypocrite&quot;&gt;I’ve heard you trash talk scroll jacking! Hypocrite!&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are animations and sounds triggered by scroll (whether or not something is in view). We wanted to play a rain soundtrack when the story mentioned rain. The same goes for fireplace crackling sounds and paper notes sliding into view. Users can still scroll smoothly, and we tried to be extremely subtle about it (which I generally think is the only way to do it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/2020/02/clock.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Paravel Sherlock Holmes: A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; title=&quot;Paravel Sherlock Holmes: A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6 id=&quot;about-the-audio&quot;&gt;About the audio&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I knew Dave and Reagan were skeptical about including music and sounds. Still, after some experimentation, I think we found the right balance—ambient tones instead of sharp notes, pulling in looping sounds (like rain) to offset the potential abruptness of a door swinging open, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also regularly fantasize about being a foley artist and/or making music for TV, movies, or games, so this helped to scratch that itch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h6 id=&quot;practicing-what-i-preach&quot;&gt;Practicing what I Preach&lt;/h6&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve been lecturing my kids about the importance of output as it relates to creativity. I’ll say stuff like, “I like hearing about all your ideas, but I love it when you turn those ideas into reality even more.” It’s inspiring to see them create tree house models out of boxes and tissue paper, write spell books, and invent comic heroes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I’ll be sharing more of my creative endeavors, whether they’re perfect, imperfect, practical, or frivolous. It feels good to get ideas out—to try things because you feel you need to. More to come!&lt;/p&gt;",
