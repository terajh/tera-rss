Of course exact rendering varies, but it gets you approx. 90% of the way there.</p> <p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/kbv57loxm0lg1.gif\">https://i.redd.it/kbv57loxm0lg1.gif</a></p> <p><strong>Compatibility scoring</strong> </p> <p>Every email now gets a score out of 100 based on which CSS properties the active client actually supports. Click the score badge to expand a breakdown of every issue found. It scores separately per client so you can see exactly where your HTML is breaking.</p> <p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ednxyv22n0lg1.gif\">https://i.redd.it/ednxyv22n0lg1.gif</a></p> <p>Completely free and open source: <a href=\"https://github.com/mailpeek/mailpeek\">https://github.com/mailpeek/mailpeek</a></p> <p>Would love to hear feedback, especially from anyone working with email templates day-to-day.

(I had some experience at my last job but things were already setup when I got there)</p> <p>Early on, I grouped things loosely by feature. That worked initially, but as the app grew, some friction started showing up:</p> <p>- Stores becoming too large and hard to reason about<br/> - Cross-store dependencies creeping in<br/> - Reset logic on logout getting messy</p> <p>Whats working is domain driven store. Keeping stores focused on data and logic, not component concerns. Being disiplined about what needs to be persisted (This is a tough one sometime)</p> <p>Keeping API calls within stores is also something I had to get used to but it&#39;s proved to be very beneficial.</p> <p>We just brought on our first intern, and setting it up this way is looking to be working out long term.

I wanted to use a Vue 3.5 feature released 17 months ago: <a href=\"https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-5#reactive-props-destructure\">reactive prop destructure</a>. It fails to do so and would similarly fail to use many of the v3.5 features like <code>useId()</code> or <code>data-allow-mismatch</code>.</p> <p>This is not a training data issue; these models have data beyond this date. The problem is that these agents don&#39;t know explicitely on what&#39;s best practice. This is by design; agents will likely never be good out-of-the-box with a new major version or library, as the training data is skewed towards old standards.</p> <p>This was really annoying to me. There are many solutions to this problem, and each has its trade-offs. For example, we can manually tell the agent what to do, but that creates a maintenance burden. We can use others&#39; Agent Skills, but they may not be maintained, or they might include other people&#39;s personal biases.</p> <p>I just want my agents to write good Vue per the docs. So I built skilld: <a href=\"https://github.com/harlan-zw/skilld\">https://github.com/harlan-zw/skilld</a></p> <p>The idea is that skills should be generated by LLMs based on real docs and release notes, since they know what they don&#39;t know. This makes skills cheap and easy to add or replace, avoiding tiresome maintenance costs.</p> <p>The only problem is that it requires an LLM and tokens. Since I assume most people aren&#39;t paying $400/month for agents, I thought I&#39;d share my personal credits to keep a repository of skills for the Vue ecosystem up to date.</p> <p>The current skills are set up for the bleeding edge: Vue v3.6 beta, Vue Router v5, Motion Vue v2, Tanstack AI, etc. But don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re using earlier versions, all references are versioned.</p> <p>Check the Vue skill itself if you&#39;re curious: <a href=\"https://github.com/harlan-zw/vue-ecosystem-skills/blob/main/skills/vue-skilld/SKILL.md\">https://github.com/harlan-zw/vue-ecosystem-skills/blob/main/skills/vue-skilld/SKILL.md</a></p> <p>Here&#39;s a sample:</p> <pre><code>## API Changes This section documents version-specific API changes — prioritize recent major/minor releases. - NEW: `createVaporApp()` (experimental) — new in v3.6, creates a Vapor-mode app instance without pulling in the Virtual DOM runtime; use `createApp()` for standard VDOM apps [source](./references/releases/v3.6.0-alpha.1.md#about-vapor-mode) - NEW: `vaporInteropPlugin` (experimental) — new in v3.6, install into a VDOM `createApp()` instance to allow Vapor components inside VDOM trees; without it, Vapor SFCs cannot be used in VDOM apps [source](./references/releases/v3.6.0-beta.1.md#about-vapor-mode) - NEW: `&lt;script setup vapor&gt;` attribute (experimental) — new in v3.6, opts an SFC into Vapor Mode compilation; only works with `&lt;script setup&gt;`; does not support Options API, `app.config.globalProperties`, or `getCurrentInstance()` [source](./references/releases/v3.6.0-beta.1.md#opting-in-to-vapor-mode) - NEW: `useTemplateRef(key)` — new in v3.5, preferred replacement for plain `ref` variable names matching `ref=&quot;key&quot;` attributes; supports dynamic string IDs at runtime unlike the old static-only pattern [source](./references/releases/blog-3.5.md#usetemplateref) - NEW: `useId()` — new in v3.5, generates stable unique IDs per component instance guaranteed to match between SSR and client hydration; replaces manual ID management for form/accessibility attributes [source](./references/releases/blog-3.5.md#useid) - NEW: `onWatcherCleanup(fn)` — new in v3.5, registers a cleanup callback inside a `watch` or `watchEffect` callback; replaces the `onCleanup` parameter pattern and can be called from nested functions [source](./references/releases/blog-3.5.md#onwatchercleanup) - NEW: `hydrateOnVisible()`, `hydrateOnIdle()`, `hydrateOnInteraction()`, `hydrateOnMediaQuery()` — new in v3.5, lazy hydration strategies passed to `defineAsyncComponent({ hydrate: hydrateOnVisible() })`; without the `hydrate` option, async components hydrate immediately [source](./references/releases/blog-3.5.md#lazy-hydration) - NEW: `defineModel()` stable — promoted from experimental in v3.3 to stable in v3.4; automatically declares a prop and returns a mutable ref; replaces the manual `defineProps` + `defineEmits(&#39;update:modelValue&#39;)` pattern [source](./references/releases/blog-3.4.md#definemodel-is-now-stable) - NEW: `defineProps` destructure with defaults — stabilized in v3.5 (was experimental in v3.3); `const { count = 0 } = defineProps&lt;{ count?: number }&gt;()` replaces `withDefaults(defineProps&lt;...&gt;(), { count: 0 })`; destructured vars must be wrapped in getters to pass to `watch()` or composables [source](./references/releases/blog-3.5.md#reactive-props-destructure) - BREAKING: `@vnodeXXX` event listeners — removed in v3.4, are now a compiler error; use `@vue:XXX` listeners instead (e.g. `@vue:mounted`) [source](./references/releases/blog-3.4.md#other-removed-features) - BREAKING: Reactivity Transform (`$ref`, `$computed`, etc.) — removed in v3.4 after being deprecated in v3.3; was experimental and distinct from the now-stable props destructure feature; use Vue Macros plugin to continue using it [source](./references/releases/blog-3.4.md#other-removed-features) - BREAKING: Global `JSX` namespace — no longer registered by default since v3.4; set `jsxImportSource: &quot;vue&quot;` in `tsconfig.json` or import `vue/jsx` to restore it; affects TSX users only [source](./references/releases/blog-3.4.md#global-jsx-namespace) - BREAKING: `app.config.unwrapInjectedRef` — removed in v3.4; ref unwrapping in `inject()` is now always enabled and cannot be disabled [source](./references/releases/blog-3.4.md#other-removed-features) - NEW: `&lt;Teleport defer&gt;` prop — new in v3.5, mounts the teleport after the current render cycle so the target element can be rendered by Vue in the same component tree; requires explicit `defer` attribute for backwards compatibility [source](./references/releases/blog-3.5.md#deferred-teleport) **Also changed:** `defineSlots&lt;{}&gt;()` macro NEW v3.3 for typed slot declarations · `defineOptions({})` macro NEW v3.3 to set component options without a separate `&lt;script&gt;` block · `toRef(() =&gt; getter)` enhanced in v3.3 to accept plain values and getters · `toValue()` NEW v3.3 normalizes values/getters/refs to values (inverse of `toRef`) · `v-bind` same-name shorthand NEW v3.4 (`:id` shorthand for `:id=&quot;id&quot;`) · `data-allow-mismatch` attribute NEW v3.5 to suppress hydration mismatch warnings · `useHost()` / `useShadowRoot()` NEW v3.5 for custom element host access · `v-is` directive REMOVED v3.4 (use `is=&quot;vue:ComponentName&quot;` instead) · reactivity system alien-signals refactor in v3.6 improves memory usage with no API changes ## Best Practices - Use reactive props destructure (3.5+) with native default value syntax instead of `withDefaults()` — destructured variables are reactive and the compiler rewrites accesses to `props.x` automatically. When passing to composables or `watch`, wrap in a getter: `watch(() =&gt; count, ...)` [source](./references/docs/api/sfc-script-setup.md#reactive-props-destructure) - Use `toValue()` in composables to normalize `MaybeRefOrGetter&lt;T&gt;` arguments — handles plain values, refs, and getter functions uniformly so callers can pass any form without the composable caring [source](./references/docs/api/reactivity-utilities.md#tovalue) - Use `onWatcherCleanup()` (3.5+) instead of the `onCleanup` callback parameter in `watch` and `watchEffect` — it can be called from any helper function in the sync execution stack, not just the top-level callback, making cleanup logic easier to extract [source](./references/docs/api/reactivity-core.md#onwatchercleanup) - Use `useTemplateRef()` (3.5+) instead of a plain `ref` with a matching variable name for template refs — supports dynamic ref IDs and provides better IDE auto-completion and type checking via `@vue/language-tools` 2.1 [source](./references/docs/api/composition-api-helpers.md#usetemplateref) - Use `useId()` (3.5+) for form element and accessibility IDs in SSR apps — generated IDs are stable across server and client renders, preventing hydration mismatches. Avoid calling inside `computed()` as it can cause instance conflicts [source](./references/docs/api/composition-api-helpers.md#useid) - Use `shallowRef()` / `shallowReactive()` for large immutable data structures — deep reactivity tracks every property access via proxy traps; shallow variants avoid this overhead while still reacting to root `.value` replacement [source](./references/docs/guide/best-practices/performance.md#reduce-reactivity-overhead-for-large-immutable-structures) - Pass computed values directly as `active` props rather than IDs for comparison — child components re-render when any received prop changes, so passing a stable boolean avoids re-rendering every list item when only one item&#39;s active state changes [source](./references/docs/guide/best-practices/performance.md#props-stability) - When a computed returns a new object on every evaluation, accept `oldValue` and return it unchanged when data is equivalent — avoids unnecessary downstream effect triggers since Vue 3.4+ only triggers effects when the computed value reference changes [source](./references/docs/guide/best-practices/performance.md#computed-stability) - Use `defineAsyncComponent` with a lazy hydration strategy (3.5+) for SSR — `hydrateOnVisible()`, `hydrateOnIdle()`, `hydrateOnInteraction()`, and `hydrateOnMediaQuery()` are tree-shakable and defer hydration until the component is actually needed ```ts import { defineAsyncComponent, hydrateOnVisible } from &#39;vue&#39; const AsyncComp = defineAsyncComponent({ loader: () =&gt; import(&#39;./Comp.vue&#39;), hydrate: hydrateOnVisible() }) ``` [source](./references/docs/guide/components/async.md#lazy-hydration) - (experimental) Opt in to Vapor Mode per-component with `&lt;script setup vapor&gt;` when targeting performance-sensitive UI — Vapor avoids Virtual DOM diffing entirely and achieves Solid/Svelte 5 benchmark parity, but does not support Options API, `app.config.globalProperties`, or `getCurrentInstance()`. Use `vaporInteropPlugin` to mix Vapor and VDOM components in an existing app [source](./references/releases/v3.6.0-beta.1.md#about-vapor-mode) </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/loonpwn\"> /u/loonpwn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/jeoeff3skgkg1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/1r90a1a/ai_agents_kept_refusing_to_use_vue_35_patterns_so/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",
