I also watch beach volleyball on YouTube, which includes a lot of live streams from the <a href=\"https://avp.com/\">AVP league</a> in the US. It's a fun sport that I recommend to anyone looking for a new athletic competition to follow.</p>\n<p>In most leagues and tournaments, beach volleyball games have a 3-set format, with each set finishing when a team reaches 21 points (or higher if they're not yet ahead by 2). The third set (played if needed) will go up to 15 points (again, win by 2). Some leagues/tournaments will play all three sets up to 15. It depends on the venue, tournament, etc.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.impressivewebs.com/youtube-time-based-ux-problem-live-sports/\">YouTube&#8217;s Time-Based UX Problem for Live Sports</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.impressivewebs.com\">Impressive Webs</a>.</p>",

I've helped with CSS articles and CSS books for various online and print publications. One of the things that comes up often when I make suggestions is the difference between a <em>CSS rule</em> and a <em>CSS ruleset</em>.</p>\n<p>In most cases, almost all authors use the term \"CSS rules\" to refer to the blocks of CSS that include the selector and the CSS declarations.
