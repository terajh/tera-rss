    "partialText": "<h4>Why understanding what we build still matters</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tnoIXIzaCVZeKqyP\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@melotic?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Justin Zhu</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I just finished reading <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems\"><em>Thinking in Systems</em></a> by Donella Meadows, and it’s one of those books that quietly rewires how you see the world.</p><p>The book was published in 2008 based on notes she wrote in the 1990s, but what struck me most was how current the problems she described remain, even in 2026. As someone building software in the AI era, this really resonated with me.</p><p>AI can write a lot of code for us now. It can even speed up learning. But it doesn’t replace the judgment required to understand the systems we’re building. That responsibility is still ours.</p><h3>An Inevitable Failure</h3><p>In late January 2026, Moltbook launched an AI-only social network. The founder proudly announced he “didn’t write a single line of code.” Within days, security researchers discovered a breach exposing 1.5 million API tokens, private messages, and email addresses. Security experts weren’t shocked. The vulnerability was predictable: the system optimized for speed and virality, not security or verification.</p><p>Complex systems rarely fail because of bad intent. They behave exactly as they’re designed to. That idea feels uncomfortably relevant in modern technology. Outcomes that feel shocking or tragic are often the result of systems doing exactly what they’re optimized to do, even if no one inside the system would describe that as the goal.</p><p>Why do these failures feel familiar instead of surprising? They follow patterns. Systems thinking is the framework for seeing them.</p><h3>What Systems Thinking Actually Is</h3><p>Systems thinking changes the question. Instead of asking <em>“who messed up?”</em> it asks, <em>“what is this system set up to do?”</em></p><p>One way to answer that question is to watch for repetition. When the same things keep happening, that’s often the system revealing how it actually works.</p><p>Once you start looking at systems this way, what happens stops feeling random. You begin to see how incentives, feedback loops, and goals shape behavior, no matter who is involved. And once you see that, you start seeing the same patterns everywhere. That’s especially true in software. And with AI in the mix, those patterns are showing up faster and at a much larger scale.</p><h4><strong>Escalation</strong></h4><blockquote>“If nothing is done to break the loop, the process usually ends with one or both of the competitors breaking down.”</blockquote><p><em>Escalation systems</em> reward keeping up, not slowing down. Competition pushes systems towards extremes. Models get bigger, faster, and more powerful. Competitors respond or risk irrelevance. Training costs rise, energy usage increases, and complexity explodes. No one can easily opt out without feeling like they’re falling behind.</p><p>Long-term risks stay abstract and delayed. Short-term gains are immediate and visible. The system rewards speed and novelty over restraint.</p><h4><strong>Seeking the wrong goal</strong></h4><p>Systems optimize what you measure, so indicators become the goal. If a behavior persists over time, there’s likely a mechanism creating it, usually a feedback loop. That loop reveals what the system is actually designed to do.</p><p>Feedback loops can only affect future behavior. They can’t deliver a signal fast enough to correct the behavior that created the current problem. By the time you see the problem, the conditions that created it are already set.</p><p>This is why the “move fast and break things” mentality actually does break things. The feedback arrives after you’ve already moved.</p><p>Take tech debt. Under constant pressure to ship, cleanup gets pushed to “later.” More pressure, less time, more debt. The cycle continues.</p><p>We see this in workplaces that reward urgency but create burnout, in products that chase engagement at the expense of trust, and in teams that add process instead of fixing system problems.</p><h4><strong>Distance from Consequences</strong></h4><p>Scale and abstraction make harm easier to ignore, and AI increases that distance. We delegate decisions, implementations, and even reasoning without seeing how all those choices play out downstream.</p><p>In the Moltbook example, when things broke, the consequences weren’t abstract. Users were exposed. Security teams scrambled. The distance between the builder and the system mattered.</p><p>That’s what understanding the system gives us. A way to stay connected to the consequences.</p><h3>Old Problems, New Velocity</h3><p>Once you recognize these patterns, something else becomes clear: none of this is new.</p><p>Meadows described these same system dynamics decades ago. What persists isn’t a lack of solutions, but a tendency to treat systemic issues as isolated events. We treat symptoms instead of making structural changes, and then act surprised when the same problems resurface.</p><p>Systems thinking reframes failure. It treats recurring issues not as one-off crises, but as predictable outcomes. Problems feel permanently “unsolved” because they aren’t meant to be fixed once. They’re systems to understand and manage over time.</p><p>In software, these dynamics are easy to recognize once you start paying attention. Work that always feels urgent. Decisions are made quickly because there isn’t time to slow down. That kind of pace can feel productive, especially under pressure. But over time, it destabilizes the system and leaves no room to examine what’s actually causing issues.</p><p>AI didn’t invent these patterns, but it does compress them. What once took months now happens in days. What used to affect a single team can quickly spill across an organization and beyond. If AI is going to scale our systems this fast, understanding what we’re building has to come before dealing with the consequences.</p><h3>What Systems Thinking Changes</h3><p>Systems thinking shifts your attention. It pushes you to ask questions like:</p><h4><strong>What is this system actually optimized for?</strong></h4><p>The answer isn’t what we say. It’s what the behavior reveals. If a company’s mission statement says “quality” but promotions reward speed, then the system is optimized for speed. If AI usage is being monitored and quantified, the system rewards usage, not necessarily quality or learning.</p><h4><strong>What are the high-leverage points?</strong></h4><p>Most changes we make are low-leverage, like tweaking parameters, adding people, piling on process. High-leverage changes are much more uncomfortable. They require changing goals, incentives, and paradigms.</p><p>This could look like changing what you measure, not just how much. Changing what behavior gets rewarded. Questioning what “success” looks like.</p><p>This is hard because paradigms defend themselves. Teams may resist new metrics because the old metrics defined their value. This is emotional work, not just technical.</p><p>Modern software is a socio-technical system: code, infrastructure, people, processes, and now, AI. This is why technical fixes often fail without human context. Nothing happens in isolation, and responsibility doesn’t disappear just because systems get abstracted or automated.</p><h3>What We Choose Not To Optimize</h3><blockquote>“Living successfully in a world of systems requires more than our ability to calculate. It requires our full humanity — our rationality, our intuition, our compassion, our vision, and our morality.”</blockquote><p>We live in a culture obsessed with what we can measure, but some things don’t show up in dashboards, like trust, meaning, quality, and relationships.</p><p>Systems thinking isn’t about optimizing efficiency. It’s about protecting what matters while building at scale. Speed, output, and metrics are means, not ends.</p><h3>What Comes Next</h3><p>We are undeniably at an inflection point. AI is accelerating how quickly ideas turn into systems, and how quickly those systems shape real lives. That speed changes the stakes.</p><p>The work ahead isn’t just technical. It’s paying attention to the patterns we’ve learned to normalize. To question what our systems reward. To notice what gets lost when speed becomes the goal.</p><p>When AI writes the code, we’re responsible for the systems it creates. Understanding them isn’t optional.</p><h4><strong>Further Reading</strong></h4><p>Donella H.

    "title": "MySQL vs PostgreSQL: How B-Tree Indexes Store Your Data Differently",
    "partialText": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Lt-MpUs26Xscfiapc9Q1Sg.png\" /></figure><p>Indexes are one of the most fundamental tools in a database engineer’s arsenal. Most developers know <em>what</em> an index does — but fewer stop to think about what actually lives inside one.</p><p>MySQL and PostgreSQL both default to B-tree indexes, and on the surface they behave the same way. But there is a critical architectural difference hiding at the leaf level that shapes how each database stores data, and how secondary indexes work as a result.</p><p>In this article, we’ll cover what an index is, how B-trees are constructed in both MySQL and PostgreSQL, and what that difference means when it comes to secondary indexes.</p><h3>What is an Index?</h3><p>When you query a database table, the database engine has to find the rows that match your conditions. Without any help, it does this by scanning every single row in the table — a process known as a full table scan. For small tables, this is fine. For tables with millions of rows, it becomes a serious performance problem.</p><p>An index is a separate data structure that the database maintains alongside your table. It organizes a copy of one or more columns in a way that makes lookups fast, without having to read every row. Think of it like the index at the back of a book — instead of reading every page to find a topic, you jump straight to the right page number.</p><p>When you create an index on a column, the database keeps that structure updated as rows are inserted, updated, or deleted. You trade a small overhead on writes for a significant gain on reads. Most of the time, that is a trade worth making.</p><h3>B-Trees</h3><p>The most common data structure used for database indexes is the B-tree, and it is the default in both MySQL and PostgreSQL.</p><p>A B-tree is a self-balancing tree where data is stored in sorted order across multiple levels. At the top sits the root node, which points to a set of internal nodes, which in turn point down to the leaf nodes at the bottom. When the database looks up a value, it starts at the root and follows the right path down the tree — comparing values at each level until it reaches the leaf.</p><p>Because the tree stays balanced, the number of steps needed to find any value is predictable and small, even for very large datasets. This makes B-trees especially efficient for exact lookups, range queries, and sorted reads.</p><p>To be precise, both MySQL and PostgreSQL actually use a variant called the <strong>B+ tree</strong>. The distinction is subtle but important: in a B+ tree, all actual data references are stored exclusively at the leaf level — internal nodes only hold keys used for navigation. The leaf nodes are also linked together as a doubly-linked list, which makes range scans particularly efficient since the database can walk across leaves sequentially without climbing back up the tree.</p><p>Where MySQL and PostgreSQL diverge is not in the shape of the tree — it is in what the leaf nodes actually contain. That is where things get interesting.</p><h3>MySQL’s Clustered Index: The Table is the Tree</h3><p>MySQL’s default storage engine, InnoDB, uses what is called a <strong>clustered index</strong>. This means that the primary key index and the actual table data are the same structure — the table <em>is</em> the B-tree.</p><p>When you define a primary key, InnoDB organizes all rows physically on disk in the order of that key. As it builds the B-tree, the leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree do not just store a reference to the row — they store the <strong>entire row data</strong> directly. Every column, every value, all sitting inside the leaf node itself.</p><p>If you do not define a primary key, InnoDB will silently pick a unique column to use instead, or generate a hidden 6-byte row ID to serve as one. Either way, a clustered index will always exist.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YDFVVTWyXushXDqSvLDmWw.png\" /></figure><h4>Performance implications</h4><p>The most direct benefit of the clustered index is read performance on primary key lookups. When you query by primary key, MySQL traverses the tree and arrives at the leaf node with everything already there — the full row is immediately available with no additional I/O.</p><p>Range queries also benefit significantly. Because rows are physically stored in primary key order, scanning a range of keys means reading contiguous pages on disk. This is much more efficient than jumping around to random locations, and it plays well with how modern storage systems prefetch data.</p><p>However, the clustered index design comes with trade-offs on the write side. Because rows must stay in sorted order, inserting a row with a primary key that falls between two existing rows can force InnoDB to rearrange data. If the relevant page is full, InnoDB splits it into two pages to make room — a process called a <strong>page split</strong>. Page splits are expensive and, over time, can lead to fragmentation, where pages are only partially filled and the physical order of data on disk no longer matches the logical order of the tree.</p><p>This is why using random or unordered primary keys — like UUIDs — is generally discouraged in MySQL. Every insert lands at a more or less random position in the tree, causing frequent page splits and fragmentation. Sequential keys, like auto-incrementing integers, always append to the end of the tree, avoiding this problem entirely.</p><h3>PostgreSQL’s Approach: Indexes as Pointers to the Heap</h3><p>PostgreSQL takes a different approach. The table data and the indexes are completely separate structures. Rows are stored in what PostgreSQL calls a <strong>heap file</strong> — essentially a collection of pages where rows are written largely in insertion order, without any particular sorting.</p><p>When PostgreSQL builds a B-tree index, the leaf nodes do not contain the row data. Instead, they store a <strong>tuple identifier (TID)</strong> — a physical pointer that records exactly which page and which slot within that page holds the actual row. Think of it as a precise address pointing into the heap.</p><p>When you query using an index, PostgreSQL traverses the B-tree to find the matching TID, then does a second lookup into the heap file to fetch the actual row. This extra step is often called a <strong>heap fetch</strong>.</p><p>This design means that in PostgreSQL, no index owns the data. The heap is the source of truth, and all indexes — including what you might think of as the “primary” one — are simply separate structures pointing back to it.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6WAUrZ6u6a3FbkHlmV69AQ.png\" /></figure><h4>What happens when you update a row</h4><p>This is where PostgreSQL’s architecture reveals one of its more significant performance implications. In PostgreSQL, when a row is updated, PostgreSQL <strong>writes a brand new version of the row</strong> into the heap and marks the old version as dead. It does not modify the existing row — it creates a new one.</p><p>Now, here is where size matters. If the updated value is larger than the original, the new row version might not fit in the same heap page. PostgreSQL will write it into a different page entirely. This is not just a heap concern — it directly affects every index on that table.</p><p>Since the new row version lives at a different physical location, its TID has changed. And because every index leaf node stores a TID pointing to the physical location of the row, <strong>every single index on that table now needs to be updated</strong> to point to the new location. If your table has five indexes, all five need to reflect the new TID. This makes wide tables with many indexes particularly sensitive to frequent updates.</p><p>There is one optimization worth knowing about: <strong>HOT updates</strong> (Heap Only Tuple). If the updated row fits on the same heap page and the updated column is not part of any index, PostgreSQL can perform a HOT update — writing the new row version on the same page and leaving all indexes untouched. The old and new versions are linked together on the page, and the indexes continue pointing to the original slot, which then redirects to the latest version. This is a significant optimization, but it only applies under those specific conditions.</p><p>Over time, dead row versions accumulate in the heap. PostgreSQL relies on a background process called <strong>VACUUM</strong> to clean them up, reclaim space, and keep performance from degrading. Without regular vacuuming, tables with heavy update workloads can bloat considerably, and index scans become slower as they encounter more dead tuples along the way.</p><h3>MySQL vs PostgreSQL Index Construction — Key Differences</h3><p>At first glance, MySQL and PostgreSQL indexes look and behave the same way. Both use B+-trees. Both support fast lookups and range scans. Both are created with the same SQL syntax. But once you look at what lives inside the leaf nodes, the two databases reveal fundamentally different philosophies about where data should live and who should own it.</p><p>In MySQL, the primary key index <em>is</em> the table. Row data lives directly inside the leaf nodes, which means a primary key lookup is a single, self-contained operation — traverse the tree, reach the leaf, and the full row is already there. This tight coupling between the index and the data delivers excellent read performance on primary key queries, but it also means inserts must respect the physical order of the tree, making the choice of primary key a critical performance decision.</p><p>In PostgreSQL, the index and the data are always separate. Leaf nodes hold nothing but a pointer — a TID — to wherever the actual row lives in the heap. Every index lookup therefore requires two steps: find the TID in the tree, then go fetch the row from the heap. This adds overhead per lookup, but it also means PostgreSQL’s storage model is more flexible — no index has special ownership of the data, and all indexes are structurally equal.</p><p>This difference has a cascading effect on writes. In MySQL, updating a row’s primary key is an expensive operation because the row must physically move within the tree. In PostgreSQL, updating any row means writing a new version into the heap and potentially updating every index on the table to reflect the new TID — a cost that grows with the number of indexes on the table.</p><p>Neither approach is strictly better. MySQL’s clustered index excels in read-heavy workloads with predictable primary key access patterns. PostgreSQL’s heap-based model offers more flexibility, especially for write-heavy workloads and tables with complex indexing needs — though it requires careful attention to vacuuming and HOT update conditions to stay performant.</p><h3>Secondary Indexes: When the Table Has More Than One Way In</h3><p>A primary index gives you one fast path into your data. But real applications rarely query by primary key alone. You search by email, filter by status, sort by date. This is where secondary indexes come in — and where the architectural difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL becomes even more consequential.</p><p><strong>MySQL — Secondary Indexes Point to the Primary Key</strong></p><p>In MySQL, a secondary index does not point directly to the row. Instead, the leaf nodes of a secondary index store the <strong>primary key value</strong> of the matching row. When you query using a secondary index, MySQL first traverses the secondary index tree to find the primary key, then performs a second traversal down the clustered index to retrieve the full row. This is called a <strong>double lookup</strong>.</p><p>This design has a very intentional reason behind it. Because InnoDB’s rows live inside the clustered index and can physically move over time — for example, during page splits — storing a direct physical pointer in every secondary index would be a maintenance nightmare. Every time a row moved, every secondary index pointing to it would need to be updated. By storing the primary key instead, MySQL insulates secondary indexes from those physical changes. The primary key acts as a stable, logical address.</p><p>The trade-off is performance. Every secondary index query involves two tree traversals instead of one. This is why choosing a small, compact primary key matters in MySQL — every secondary index carries a copy of it. A large primary key, like a UUID string, inflates the size of every secondary index on the table.</p><p><strong>PostgreSQL — Secondary Indexes Point to the Heap</strong></p><p>In PostgreSQL, a secondary index works exactly the same way as a primary one — because there is no structural distinction between them. Every index, whether built on the primary key column or any other column, stores TIDs pointing directly into the heap. There is no double lookup.</p><p>On the surface this sounds like an advantage, and for single-row lookups it is. But it comes with the same update cost discussed earlier. When a row is updated and its new version lands at a different heap location, every index on the table — primary and secondary alike — must be updated to reflect the new TID. The more secondary indexes a table has, the more expensive write operations become.</p><p>There is one meaningful optimization: if all the columns needed to satisfy a query are present within the index itself, PostgreSQL can perform an <strong>index-only scan</strong>, skipping the heap fetch entirely. This is a powerful tool for read performance, but it requires deliberate index design and depends on the visibility map being up to date — yet another reason regular vacuuming matters in PostgreSQL.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>MySQL and PostgreSQL are both mature, battle-tested databases — and yet, under the surface, they make very different bets about how data should be stored and accessed.</p><p>MySQL bets on the clustered index. By merging the primary index and the table into a single structure, it optimizes for the most common case: fetching rows by primary key. Secondary indexes pay a small price for this — a double lookup — but the overall model is predictable and performs well for read-heavy, primary-key-centric workloads.</p><p>PostgreSQL bets on separation. The heap is the source of truth, and indexes are independent structures that point into it. This gives PostgreSQL more flexibility and a simpler, more uniform index model, but it shifts the burden onto writes and requires disciplined database maintenance to stay healthy over time.</p><p>Neither design is universally superior. The right choice depends on your workload, your query patterns, and how much control you want over the trade-offs. But understanding what actually happens inside the tree — and what sits at the leaf level — puts you in a far better position to make those decisions with confidence.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=809619a6c4b8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/mysql-vs-postgresql-how-b-tree-indexes-store-your-data-differently-809619a6c4b8\">MySQL vs PostgreSQL: How B-Tree Indexes Store Your Data Differently</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com\">Level Up Coding</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Then metrics showed the truth.</h4><p>October 12, 2025. The email that made developers riot.</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Security Policy Update: AI Coding Assistants Prohibited</p><p><strong>Body:</strong> Effective immediately, all cloud-based AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) are banned on company devices. Security and IP concerns.</p><p>The Slack channel exploded. 47 messages in 10 minutes.</p><p>“This will kill productivity.”<br> “How are we supposed to compete without AI?”<br> “I’m gonna be so slow now.”</p><p>One senior dev threatened to quit.</p><p>I was the VP of Engineering who signed off on the ban. I expected mutiny.</p><p>Six months later, I’m looking at our metrics.</p><p><strong>Productivity is up 20%.</strong></p><h3>The Numbers Nobody Expected</h3><p><strong>Before the ban (July-September 2025):</strong></p><ul><li>Pull requests per week: 127</li><li>Average PR size: 847 lines</li><li>Code review time: 6.2 hours per PR</li><li>Bug escape rate: 18%</li><li>P0 incidents: 12</li><li>Developer satisfaction score: 3.2/5</li></ul><p><strong>After the ban (November 2025-January 2026):</strong></p><ul><li>Pull requests per week: 156 (+23%)</li><li>Average PR size: 423 lines (-50%)</li><li>Code review time: 3.8 hours per PR (-39%)</li><li>Bug escape rate: 9% (-50%)</li><li>P0 incidents: 4 (-67%)</li><li>Developer satisfaction score: 4.1/5 (+28%)</li></ul><p>We banned AI tools expecting productivity to crash.</p><p>Instead, every metric improved.</p><h3>What Actually Happened</h3><p><strong>Week 1: The Panic</strong></p><p>Developers were legitimately slower. They’d gotten used to AI autocomplete. Typing felt painful.</p><p>Average commit time increased 40%. I started second-guessing the decision.</p><p><strong>Week 3: The Adjustment</strong></p><p>Something weird happened. PRs got smaller. Instead of massive AI-generated refactors, developers shipped focused changes.</p><p>Code review became faster. Reviewers could actually understand what changed.</p><p><strong>Week 6: The Pattern</strong></p><p>Bugs started dropping. Not gradually. Dramatically.</p><p>Before: AI would suggest “optimizations” that looked good but broke edge cases.<br> After: Developers wrote defensive code because they thought through each line.</p><p><strong>Week 12: The Data</strong></p><p>We ran the analysis. Productivity was up across every metric.</p><p>The team that fought the ban the hardest? They improved the most.</p><h3>The Real Reasons AI Was Slowing Us Down</h3><h3>1. The Trust Problem</h3><p><strong>With AI:</strong><br> Developer writes prompt → AI generates 200 lines → Developer scans it → Looks good → Ship it → Bug in production</p><p><strong>Without AI:</strong><br> Developer writes 50 lines → Thinks through edge cases → Tests manually → Ships it → Works</p><p>AI made us lazy reviewers of our own code.</p><p>We stopped asking “what could go wrong?” because AI code looked confident.</p><h3>2. The Context Problem</h3><p>Our codebase: 847,000 lines. 8 years old. Custom architecture. Tribal knowledge everywhere.</p><p>AI trained on: Public GitHub repos. Generic patterns. Nothing about our specific system.</p><p><strong>Example disaster:</strong></p><p>AI suggested this “optimization”:</p><pre># AI&#39;s confident suggestion<br>@cache_result(ttl=3600)<br>def get_user_balance(user_id):<br>    return database.query(f&quot;SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE user_id={user_id}&quot;)</pre><p>Looks fine, right?</p><p>Except our system updates balances every 30 seconds during trading hours. The 1-hour cache meant users saw stale data for 59 minutes.</p><p>Cost us $47,000 in incorrect transactions before we caught it.</p><p>AI didn’t know our business rules. Developers who trusted it didn’t question the suggestion.</p><h3>3. The “Looks Good” Problem</h3><p>AI code passes one test: Does it look reasonable?</p><p>It fails another: Does it handle the 15 edge cases specific to our domain?</p><p><strong>Real example:</strong></p><p>AI-generated payment processing code looked perfect. Handled happy path beautifully.</p><p>What it missed:</p><ul><li>Duplicate charge prevention (2 users got charged twice)</li><li>Currency conversion edge cases (1 user charged in wrong currency)</li><li>Timeout handling (3 users got “failed” message but were charged)</li><li>Race conditions (4 concurrent requests created 4 charges)</li></ul><p>Manual code would’ve been slower to write. But we would’ve thought through these cases.</p><h3>4. The Knowledge Transfer Problem</h3><p>Junior developer joins. Asks: “Why does this function work this way?”</p><p><strong>Before ban:</strong><br> Senior: “I don’t know, AI wrote it. Let me check…”<br> <em>Checks code</em><br> “Honestly, I’m not sure. It works though.”</p><p><strong>After ban:</strong><br> Senior: “Because we need to handle timezone conversions before comparing dates. Let me show you why…”<br> <em>Actually explains the business logic</em></p><p>AI code created knowledge silos. Only AI knew why it worked.</p><h3>5. The Code Review Theater Problem</h3><p><strong>Before ban:</strong><br> “LGTM 👍” (didn’t actually read the 800 AI-generated lines)</p><p><strong>After ban:</strong><br> “Why did you choose HashMap over TreeMap here?”<br> “This method is doing too much. Can we split it?”<br> “What happens if the API times out?”</p><p>Real code review came back.</p><h3>The One Thing That Surprised Me Most</h3><p><strong>Developer satisfaction went UP.</strong></p><p>I expected developers to hate the ban. They loved AI autocomplete.</p><p>But after 3 months, satisfaction scores jumped from 3.2 to 4.1.</p><p>Why?</p><p><strong>Before (with AI):</strong> “I spent 2 hours fighting with Copilot suggestions. It kept suggesting broken code. Then spent 4 hours debugging the code I accepted.”</p><p><strong>After (without AI):</strong> “Coding feels slower but I’m not debugging AI hallucinations. I ship features and they work.”</p><p>Turns out, fighting with AI was more frustrating than writing code manually.</p><h3>What We Kept (And Why)</h3><p>We didn’t ban ALL AI. We banned coding assistants.</p><p><strong>What we still use:</strong></p><p><strong>1. ChatGPT for documentation</strong><br> “Explain this legacy Java code” → Actually useful<br> Not generating code, just explaining it</p><p><strong>2. AI for test generation</strong><br> Generate unit test templates → Developer reviews and modifies<br> Speeds up the boring part, developer still thinks</p><p><strong>3. Code review AI (self-hosted)</strong><br> Runs on our infrastructure, doesn’t send code to cloud<br> Catches obvious issues (unused variables, SQL injection patterns)</p><p><strong>4. AI for log analysis</strong><br> Perfect use case. AI reads thousands of log lines, highlights patterns<br> Human still debugs, AI just filters noise</p><p>The pattern: <strong>AI as assistant, not author.</strong></p><h3>The Controversial Part</h3><p>Some developers still disagree with the ban.</p><p>“I’m faster with AI. I know how to use it properly.”</p><p>They’re right. Some developers ARE faster with AI.</p><p>But here’s the thing: <strong>We’re not optimizing for individual speed. We’re optimizing for team quality.</strong></p><p>One developer shipping fast with AI-generated bugs costs the team more than five developers shipping slower with clean code.</p><p>We measured it. AI-generated code had 3.2x more bugs per line than human-written code.</p><h3>📬 What I’m Working On</h3><p>While banning AI coding tools, I realized there’s ONE place AI actually helps: <strong>production incidents.</strong></p><p>Not writing code. Explaining what went wrong.</p><p>I’m building <strong>ProdRescue AI</strong> — turns messy incident logs into clear postmortem reports in 90 seconds.</p><p>No code generation. Just log analysis and report writing.</p><p>Early access is open:<br> 👉 <strong>Join the waitlist (2-min form)</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://prodrescue-ai.vercel.app/\">ProdRescue AI</a></p><p>This is AI used right: analyzing data, not generating code.</p><h3>What Other Companies Are Doing</h3><p>We’re not alone. After sharing our results internally, I talked to 12 other CTOs.</p><p><strong>3 companies banned AI coding tools completely</strong> (same results as us)<br> <strong>5 companies restricted to senior engineers only</strong> (juniors can’t use AI)<br> <strong>4 companies still allow it</strong> (but reconsidering after seeing metrics)</p><p>The trend: Companies measuring productivity are pulling back on AI.</p><p>Companies not measuring? Still pushing AI everywhere.</p><h3>The Real Lesson</h3><p>AI coding tools solve the wrong problem.</p><p><strong>The problem isn’t:</strong> “How do I write code faster?”<br> <strong>The problem is:</strong> “How do I write code that works in production?”</p><p>AI optimizes for speed. Production requires reliability.</p><p>We chose reliability. Productivity followed.</p><h3>If You’re Dealing With Production Failures</h3><p>The ban taught us: Prevention beats debugging.</p><p>Writing careful code manually prevents more bugs than AI speed creates.</p><p>If you’re tired of production incidents, these resources might help:</p><p><strong>🔧 </strong><a href=\"https://devrimozcay.gumroad.com/l/rlmxr\"><strong>Production Engineering Toolkit</strong></a><br> Real production failures and how to prevent them</p><p><strong>📚 </strong><a href=\"https://devrimozcay.gumroad.com/l/rkdgug\"><strong>Backend Performance Rescue Kit</strong></a><br> Find and fix the 20 bottlenecks killing your app</p><p><strong>🎯 </strong><a href=\"https://devrimozcay.gumroad.com/l/xbihfx\"><strong>30 Real Incidents That Cost Companies Thousands</strong></a><br> Full postmortems with prevention steps</p><p>More resources: <a href=\"https://devrimozcay.gumroad.com/\"><strong>devrimozcay.gumroad.com</strong></a></p><h3>The Metrics After 6 Months</h3><p><strong>January 2026 (Month 6 post-ban):</strong></p><ul><li>Pull requests per week: 167 (+31% vs baseline)</li><li>Code review time: 3.2 hours (-48%)</li><li>Bug escape rate: 7% (-61%)</li><li>P0 incidents: 2 (-83%)</li><li>Developer satisfaction: 4.3/5 (+34%)</li><li>Time debugging: -12 hours per week per developer</li></ul><p><strong>The most surprising metric:</strong></p><p>Developer velocity (features shipped per sprint) went up 18%.</p><p>We were worried banning AI would slow feature development.</p><p>Turns out, fewer bugs means more time building features.</p><h3>What I’d Tell My Past Self</h3><p>October 2025, before the ban, I was scared.</p><p>“What if productivity crashes? What if developers quit? What if we fall behind competitors?”</p><p>Now I know: <strong>The metrics don’t lie.</strong></p><p>AI coding tools made us FEEL productive. They made us actually slower.</p><p>Would I ban AI again? Yes.</p><p>Would I use AI for other things? Yes. (Log analysis, documentation, test generation)</p><p>The lesson: <strong>AI is a tool. Not all tools fit all problems.</strong></p><p>For code generation? We found a better tool: human developers who think.</p><h3>The Uncomfortable Truth</h3><p>This article will make people angry.</p><p>“AI makes ME faster!” (Maybe. But does it make your team faster?)<br> “You just don’t know how to use AI!” (We had 6 months of data.)<br> “My company would never ban AI!” (That’s fine. Measure your metrics.)</p><p>I’m not saying AI coding tools are bad for everyone.</p><p>I’m saying: <strong>Measure before assuming.</strong></p><p>We assumed AI would help. Metrics showed it hurt.</p><p>Maybe your metrics are different. Great! Share them.</p><p>But if you’ve never measured productivity with vs without AI, you’re guessing.</p><p>We stopped guessing. Started measuring.</p><h3>One Year Later (Update)</h3><p>It’s been a year since the ban.</p><p>Developers who threatened to quit? Still here. They admit they’re happier.</p><p>Metrics? Still better than before.</p><p>Competitors who went all-in on AI? Some are rolling back. Others are dealing with increased bug rates.</p><p>The industry is learning: <strong>Fast code generation ≠ Good code.</strong></p><p>We learned early. Paid the price. Got better.</p><p>Your company will decide for itself.</p><p>Just measure the real metrics. Not “developer happiness with AI tools.”</p><p>Measure: Bugs in production. Time debugging. Code quality. Feature velocity.</p><p>Then decide.</p><p><strong>— The developers who fought the ban hardest? They’re now the biggest advocates. They didn’t realize how much time they spent debugging AI code until they stopped.</strong></p><p><strong>— We still ban AI coding tools. We still measure metrics. Productivity is still up 20%. I don’t see us reversing this decision.</strong></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=077eb325eadf\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr><p><a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/our-company-banned-ai-coding-tools-productivity-went-up-20-heres-why-077eb325eadf\">Our Company Banned AI Coding Tools.
