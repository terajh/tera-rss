    "title": "Reducing notification overload for a quieter browsing experience in Chrome",
    "partialText": "<p>\nWe're constantly working to improve your browsing experience. To help you cut through the noise and reduce notification overload, we’re launching a new feature to automatically remove notification permission for sites you haven't interacted with recently. Today, Chrome’s Safety Check <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-safety-update-september-2024/\">already does this</a> for other permissions such as camera and location. The feature will be launched in Chrome on Android and desktop.\n</p>\n<p>\nData indicates that users frequently receive a high volume of notifications, resulting in minimal engagement and high disruption. Less than 1% of all notifications receive any interaction from users.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut notifications can be genuinely valuable and helpful. Therefore, this feature will only revoke permissions for sites when there is very low user engagement and a high volume of notifications being sent. This feature does not revoke notifications for <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1\">any installed web apps</a>. \n</p>\n<p>\nChrome will inform you when notification permissions are removed. If you prefer to keep getting notifications from a particular website, you can easily re-grant the permission at any time through Safety Check or alternatively by visiting the site and enabling notifications again. You can also choose to turn off the auto-revocation feature entirely.\n</p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBESUSexTeb8BtWSMAcsKILZYGMYpYHqONZ0FWuU5g9OLFbdnHbP81gGI6LHizOJLS0eFr_V1S0AQdtiQeEJcFEQVK355w7HEqZCIleo7H2KKqAlreIO2BXvCDYsrgmxzzYSjIL35MWJtwYg5q0LhxsBvLZWXE4AT58Zqx0rQf-oMX-rYWPhW2Yb9fHxbT/s1600/Screenshot%202025-10-10%20at%2012.10.49%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"517\" data-original-width=\"709\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBESUSexTeb8BtWSMAcsKILZYGMYpYHqONZ0FWuU5g9OLFbdnHbP81gGI6LHizOJLS0eFr_V1S0AQdtiQeEJcFEQVK355w7HEqZCIleo7H2KKqAlreIO2BXvCDYsrgmxzzYSjIL35MWJtwYg5q0LhxsBvLZWXE4AT58Zqx0rQf-oMX-rYWPhW2Yb9fHxbT/s1600/Screenshot%202025-10-10%20at%2012.10.49%E2%80%AFPM.png\"/></a></div>\n\n<p>\nWe've already been testing this feature. Our test results show a significant reduction in notification overload with only a minimal change in total notification clicks. Our experiments also indicate that websites that send a lower volume of notifications are actually seeing an increase in clicks. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis launch is part of our ongoing commitment to user safety, privacy, and control. We believe this change will lead to a cleaner, more focused browsing experience, and we’ll continue to invest in ways to help you manage your online interactions and reduce distractions, so you can make the most of your time online.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"post-author\">Posted by Archit Agarwal, Product Manager, Chrome</span>",

Graphite is instrumental in helping Chrome achieve exceptional scores on Motionmark 1.3 and is key to unlocking a ton of future improvements in Chrome Graphics.</em>\n</p>\n<h1>A brief history of Skia in Chrome</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nIn Chrome, Skia is used to render paint commands from Blink and the browser UI into pixels on your screen, a process called rasterization. Skia has powered Chrome Graphics <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.chromium.org/2008/10/graphics-in-google-chrome.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1744655288075052&amp;usg=AOvVaw2iZg3ILJvcyGeG8RDYzVNv\">since the very beginning</a>. Skia eventually ran into performance issues as the web evolved and became more complex, which led Chrome and Skia to invest in a GPU accelerated rasterization backend called Ganesh.  \n</p>\n<p>\nOver the years, Ganesh matured into a solid highly performant rasterization backend and GPU rasterization launched on all platforms in Chrome on top of GL (via ANGLE on Windows D3D9/11). However, Ganesh always had a GL-centric design with too many specialized code paths and the team was hitting a wall when trying to implement optimizations that took advantage of modern graphics APIs in a principled manner.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis set the stage for the team to rethink GPU rasterization from the ground up in the form of a new rasterization backend, Graphite. Graphite was developed from the start to be principled by having fewer and more comprehensible code paths. This forward looking design helps take advantage of modern graphics APIs like Metal, Vulkan and D3D12 and paradigms like compute based path rasterization, and is multithreaded by default.\n</p>\n<h1>Results</h1>\n<p>\nWith Graphite in Chrome, we increased our Motionmark 1.3 scores by almost 15% on a Macbook Pro M3. At the same time, we improved real world metrics like INP (interaction to next paint time), LCP (time to largest contentful paint),  graphics smoothness (percent dropped frames), GPU process malloc memory usage, and others. This all means substantially smoother interactions, less stutter when scrolling, and less time waiting for sites to show.\n</p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK7OcoGT0p5zxAfiA30b8wcjhxDlovG2IUL3DNsazr0NBYBK-yoizvfdjng-6jOXE_T4hEGGGR6D3MsytJj6qkFkjS8Fjs8PjYHbHvCljY6fwmpMUIalNFg4QRp2fpFolLIQJmwar4IrhBtgbzuyhh7zRMbSv_rHSsDBycZ0G0SDn53owruvmmkgqTs9qr/s1600/Screenshot%202025-07-08%20at%2012.40.51%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"587\" data-original-width=\"677\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK7OcoGT0p5zxAfiA30b8wcjhxDlovG2IUL3DNsazr0NBYBK-yoizvfdjng-6jOXE_T4hEGGGR6D3MsytJj6qkFkjS8Fjs8PjYHbHvCljY6fwmpMUIalNFg4QRp2fpFolLIQJmwar4IrhBtgbzuyhh7zRMbSv_rHSsDBycZ0G0SDn53owruvmmkgqTs9qr/s1600/Screenshot%202025-07-08%20at%2012.40.51%E2%80%AFPM.png\" /></a></div>\n<h1>Differences between Graphite and Ganesh</h1>\n\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Modern graphics APIs</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nGanesh was originally implemented on OpenGL ES, which had minimal support for multi-threading or GPU capabilities like compute shaders. Since then, modern graphics APIs like Vulkan, Metal and D3D12 have evolved to take advantage of multithreading and expose new GPU capabilities. They allow applications to have much more control over when and how expensive work such as allocating GPU resources is performed and scheduled, while utilizing both the CPU and the GPU effectively.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile we were able to adapt Ganesh to support modern graphics APIs, it had accumulated enough technical debt that it became hard to fully take advantage of the multi-threading and GPU compute capabilities of modern graphics APIs.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor Graphite in Chrome, we chose to use Chrome's WebGPU implementation, <a href=\"https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn\">Dawn</a>, as the abstraction layer for platform native graphics APIs like Metal, Vulkan and D3D. Dawn provides a baseline for capabilities common in modern graphics APIs and helps us reduce the long term maintenance burden by leveraging Dawn's mature well tested native backends instead of implementing them from scratch for Graphite. \n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">2D depth(?!) testing</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nA core part of the GPU rendering pipeline is depth testing, which can reduce or eliminate overdraw by drawing opaque objects in front to back order, followed by translucent objects back to front. In graphics, \"overdraw\" refers to the unnecessary rendering of the same pixels multiple times, which can negatively impact performance and battery life, especially on mobile devices.\n</p>\n<p>\nGanesh never utilized the depth testing capabilities of graphics cards, which was admittedly intended for rendering 3D content and not accelerating 2D graphics. Ganesh suffers from overdraw due to its reliance on adhering to strict painters order when drawing both opaque and translucent objects.\n</p>\n<p>\nGraphite extends Skia’s GPU rendering to take advantage of the depth test by assigning each “draw” a <em>z </em>value defining its painter’s ordering index. While transparent effects and images must still be drawn from back to front, opaque objects in the foreground can now automatically eliminate overdraw. This means opaque draws can be re-ordered to minimize expensive GPU state changes while relying on the depth buffer to produce correct output.\n</p>\n<p>\nDepth testing is also used to implement clipping in Graphite by treating clip shapes as depth only draws as opposed to maintaining a clip stack like in Ganesh. Besides reducing algorithmic complexity, a significant benefit to this approach is that the shader program required to render a “draw” does not also depend on the state of the clip stack.\n</p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJvgOlBS_vrfP7D7vbi9seLOrlsKLhSWmuo6Lc6RiHIjvm23kjXT7zNM_iFS_ojrEowtoLhvSaCgDeoSWlwFWDH5vyqE23zhLCjPPrs6fLVTiGWw-os-ErUrz3VicU1r_Za-A4tRzyeW1BrVmqz8sgK7QLNMK27eB2u7lPeX1Kb9O4o-6y3bNzRZi9z3VZ/s1600/Screenshot%202025-07-08%20at%2012.42.02%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"238\" data-original-width=\"637\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJvgOlBS_vrfP7D7vbi9seLOrlsKLhSWmuo6Lc6RiHIjvm23kjXT7zNM_iFS_ojrEowtoLhvSaCgDeoSWlwFWDH5vyqE23zhLCjPPrs6fLVTiGWw-os-ErUrz3VicU1r_Za-A4tRzyeW1BrVmqz8sgK7QLNMK27eB2u7lPeX1Kb9O4o-6y3bNzRZi9z3VZ/s1600/Screenshot%202025-07-08%20at%2012.42.02%E2%80%AFPM.png\" /></a></div>\n<p>\nLeft: Frame from Motionmark Suits Right: Depth buffer for the same frame.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Multithreading</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nChromium is a complex multi-process application, with render processes issuing commands to a shared GPU process that is responsible for actually displaying everything in a webpage, tab, and even the browser UI. The GPU process main thread is the primary driver of all rendering work and is where all GPU commands are issued.\n</p>\n<p>\nDue to the single threaded nature of Ganesh and OpenGL, only a limited set of work could be moved to other threads, making it easy to overload the main thread causing increased jank and latency ultimately hurting user experience.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn contrast, Graphite's API is designed to take advantage of multithreading capabilities of modern graphics APIs. Graphite’s new core API is centered around independent <em>Recorders</em> that can produce <em>Recordings</em> on multiple threads, with minimal need to synchronize between them. Even though the <em>Recordings</em> are submitted to the GPU on the main thread, more expensive work is moved to other threads when producing <em>Recordings</em>, keeping the GPU main thread free.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Performance cliffs and pipeline compilation</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWhen Ganesh was initially implemented, the programmable capabilities of graphics cards were quite limited, and branching in particular was expensive. To work around this, Ganesh had many specialized shader pipelines to handle common cases. These specializations are hard to predict and depend on a large number of factors related to each individual draw, leading to an explosion of different pipelines for essentially the same page content. Since these pipelines must each be compiled, it doesn't work well for modern web content which might have effects and animations trigger new pipelines at any moment, causing noticeable jank.\n</p>\n<p>\nGraphite’s design philosophy is instead to consolidate the number of rendering pipelines as much as possible while still preserving performance.  This reduces the number of pipelines that have to be compiled, and makes it possible for Chrome to ensure they are compiled at startup so they do not interrupt active browsing. Ganesh’s specialization approach also led to surprising performance cliffs. For example, while it could handle simple cases, real page content was often a complex mix. By consolidating pipelines, complex content can be rendered as effectively as simple content.\n</p>\n<h1>Future Plans</h1>\n\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Multithreaded Rasterization</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nCurrently, Graphite is integrated into Chromium using two Recorders: one handles web content tiles and Canvas2D on the main thread, while the other is for compositing.  In the future, this model will open up a number of exciting possibilities to further improve Chrome’s performance.  Instead of saturating the main GPU thread with the tasks from each renderer process, rasterization can be forked across multiple threads.\n</p>\n<p>\nCurrent:\n</p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3Yp75STRKmlqx_4MJ5OTvQ5Tz1z7v2xRopsCekbpxOuUrxWptOz5ihk6VIJNTtj4uwKzV2CGOC_s_hJXKRKYkyOd1mKeol4SO20GdRuRQLS7KlkWpy5TuslgfJJz8fuoXUMvDwHmtqgFVGVsb08Yf5th5LX84dwGBRHZqSAOdcAxZYOPKu_tVWJBFkBIL/s1600/Screenshot%202025-07-08%20at%2012.43.01%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"833\" data-original-width=\"768\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3Yp75STRKmlqx_4MJ5OTvQ5Tz1z7v2xRopsCekbpxOuUrxWptOz5ihk6VIJNTtj4uwKzV2CGOC_s_hJXKRKYkyOd1mKeol4SO20GdRuRQLS7KlkWpy5TuslgfJJz8fuoXUMvDwHmtqgFVGVsb08Yf5th5LX84dwGBRHZqSAOdcAxZYOPKu_tVWJBFkBIL/s1600/Screenshot%202025-07-08%20at%2012.43.01%E2%80%AFPM.png\" /></a></div>\n<p>\nFuture:\n</p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfZABxcWDhyphenhyphen8ziigDEkaW97viWcKe-TVFCf9gISovY__siuJKB09cUmyV4TPqB78Y1LzOyU5zHQgeH_eGEZ9aepscWyFWVhTtrpu6QwHzWGBmG70iPibu4e4NX47XHBOXV0Ufa6eyEvV2-i9gD-KlrOdfHMrmfpp7ueXPvsRsmgLgCBQvTxGEMvRmb4M9i/s1600/Screenshot%202025-07-08%20at%2012.44.09%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"562\" data-original-width=\"786\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfZABxcWDhyphenhyphen8ziigDEkaW97viWcKe-TVFCf9gISovY__siuJKB09cUmyV4TPqB78Y1LzOyU5zHQgeH_eGEZ9aepscWyFWVhTtrpu6QwHzWGBmG70iPibu4e4NX47XHBOXV0Ufa6eyEvV2-i9gD-KlrOdfHMrmfpp7ueXPvsRsmgLgCBQvTxGEMvRmb4M9i/s1600/Screenshot%202025-07-08%20at%2012.44.09%E2%80%AFPM.png\" /></a></div>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Reducing GPU memory for simple content</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nGraphite recordings can also be re-issued to the GPU with certain dynamic changes such as translation. This can be used to accelerate scrolling while eliminating the unnecessary work to re-issue rendering commands.  This lets us automatically reduce the amount of GPU memory required to cache web content as tiles. If the content is simple enough, the performance difference between drawing a cached image and drawing its content can be worth skipping allocating a tile for it and just re-rendering it each frame.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">GPU Compute Path Rasterization</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nIn the landscape of 2D graphics rendering, <a href=\"https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/graphics/gpu/2020/06/13/fast-2d-rendering.html\">GPU compute-based path rasterization</a> is very much en vogue with recent implementations like <a href=\"https://github.com/pcwalton/pathfinder\">Pathfinder</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/linebender/vello\">vello</a>. We would like to implement these ideas in Skia, possibly using a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEqf7ehTzd89Djf_VpkL0B_Fb15e0w5fuv_UzyacAPU/preview\">hybrid approach</a>. Currently, Graphite relies on MSAA where it can, but in many cases we can't due to poor performance on older integrated GPUs or high memory overhead on non-tiling GPUs, and we have to fallback to CPU path rasterization using an atlas for caching. GPU compute based path rasterization would allow us to improve over both the visual quality of MSAA which is often limited to 4 samples per pixel and over the performance of CPU rasterization.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese are future directions the Chrome Graphics team plans to pursue, and we are excited to see how far we can push the needle.\n</p>\n<p>\n  \n</p>\n<span class=\"post-author\">Posted By Michael Ludwig &amp; Sunny Sachanandani\n </span>",

For a deeper dive into these individual parts, we recommend the presentation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2QHdgAKP-s\">Life of a Script at Chrome University</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nAchieving exceptional web performance requires a multifaceted approach, and optimizing for Speedometer is a testament to overall product excellence. Over the past year, our team has focused on refining fundamental rendering paths across the entire stack. Here are some notable optimization examples.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe team heavily optimized memory layouts of many internal data structures across DOM, CSS, layout, and painting components. Blink now avoids a lot of useless churn on system memory by keeping state where it belongs with respect to access patterns, maximizing utilization of CPU caches. Where internal memory was already relying on garbage collection in Oilpan, e.g. DOM, the usage was expanded by converting types from using malloc to Oilpan. This generally speeds up the affected areas as it packs memory nicely in Oilpan’s backend.\n</p>\n<p>\nStrings in the renderer improved quite a bit over the last year by avoiding costly representations where possible and switching hashing to rapidhash.

    "partialText": "<p>\nNotifications in Chrome are a useful feature to keep up with updates from your favorite sites. However, we know that some notifications may be spammy or even deceptive. We’ve received reports of notifications diverting you to download suspicious software, tricking you into sharing personal information or asking you to make purchases on potentially fraudulent online store fronts. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo defend against these threats, Chrome is launching warnings of unwanted notifications on Android. This new feature uses on-device machine learning to detect and warn you about potentially deceptive or spammy notifications, giving you an extra level of control over the information displayed on your device.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen a notification is flagged by Chrome, you’ll see the name of the site sending the notification, a message warning that the contents of the notification are potentially deceptive or spammy, and the option to either unsubscribe from the site or see the flagged content. \n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdCMwUjjbBbWbcsIDPz1-12QyQOWYYHRBrw-V3fZlpdpLIhb-KR6ZQVUnB5Lc0CcsLuOLaz5H6TxtxbcFfNSnaSRcEN6f-NeXe4Q271frko8j3oKrH-lIBFoWWtq17stBqfEHK8sOj-epcZoXj43KRHpEWjlnYF-jFYWC0qrDf4hTBsAAzgvbBRI-os7ft/s1600/Screenshot%202025-05-07%20at%202.41.50%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"636\" data-original-width=\"369\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdCMwUjjbBbWbcsIDPz1-12QyQOWYYHRBrw-V3fZlpdpLIhb-KR6ZQVUnB5Lc0CcsLuOLaz5H6TxtxbcFfNSnaSRcEN6f-NeXe4Q271frko8j3oKrH-lIBFoWWtq17stBqfEHK8sOj-epcZoXj43KRHpEWjlnYF-jFYWC0qrDf4hTBsAAzgvbBRI-os7ft/s1600/Screenshot%202025-05-07%20at%202.41.50%E2%80%AFPM.png\"/></a></div>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\nAn example of a notification flagged as possibly spam.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you choose to see the notification you will still see the option to unsubscribe or you can choose to always allow notifications from that site and not see warnings in the future. \n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-pUXQlfKAIH427ozKplzv2geQz_cNc_EOjxSaB9K4nRDXhbiFGYBpR6FTWd95ehGxVZ0de_piDUmEjis_tShIJddv27scbA0rs3KjyL5DvNXoN_ABiikAvQTp6bDeMjHMEO5PP-4Mjy3-b-Fe0sKSQpVVoXsP3X2mqrHF2mfAQCd9ltrBBnA5HxhUfkgG/s1600/Screenshot%202025-05-07%20at%202.42.46%E2%80%AFPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"631\" data-original-width=\"350\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-pUXQlfKAIH427ozKplzv2geQz_cNc_EOjxSaB9K4nRDXhbiFGYBpR6FTWd95ehGxVZ0de_piDUmEjis_tShIJddv27scbA0rs3KjyL5DvNXoN_ABiikAvQTp6bDeMjHMEO5PP-4Mjy3-b-Fe0sKSQpVVoXsP3X2mqrHF2mfAQCd9ltrBBnA5HxhUfkgG/s1600/Screenshot%202025-05-07%20at%202.42.46%E2%80%AFPM.png\"/></a></div>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\nWhat you see when viewing a flagged notification. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How It Works</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nChrome uses a local, on-device machine learning model to analyze notification content. This model identifies notifications that are likely to be unwanted. The model is trained on the textual contents of the notification, like the title, body, and action button texts.\n</p>\n<p>\nNotifications are end to end encrypted. The analysis of each message is done on-device and notification contents are not sent to Google, to protect user privacy. Due to the sensitive nature of notifications content, the model was trained using synthetic data generated by the Gemini large language model (LLM). The training data was evaluated against real notifications Chrome security team collected by subscribing to a variety of websites that were then classified by human experts. To start, this feature is only available on Android as the majority of notifications are sent to mobile devices, however we will evaluate expanding to other platforms in the future.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis feature is just one of many ways Chrome works to reduce the number of potentially harmful notifications you receive. Other ways Chrome protects against potentially harmful notifications include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Revoking Notification Permissions from Abusive Sites: When Google Safe Browsing identifies a site engaging in abusive behavior Chrome will automatically revoke the site’s notification permissions. You can find a list of revoked notification permissions in Chrome Safety Check.

    "title": "Making Chrome QUICer",
    "partialText": "<p>\nIn October 2020, Chrome enabled <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-is-deploying-http3-and-ietf-quic.html\">HTTP/3 by default</a>. HTTP/3 (<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114\">RFC 9114</a>) runs over IETF QUIC (<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000\">RFC9000</a>). Default-enabling HTTP/3 in Chrome resulted in improved performance compared not only HTTP/1 and HTTP/2, but also Google QUIC. Benefits included reduced Google search latency and fewer rebuffers for YouTube.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe journey to optimizing performance did not end when HTTP/3 was default enabled. Recent advancements include the implementation of the HTTP/3 ORIGIN frame (<a href=\"https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9412.html\">RFC 9412</a>) and Server's Preferred Address (<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#name-servers-preferred-address\">RFC 9000 Section 9.6</a>). The former enhances connection coalescing, while the latter reduces a connection's round trip time (RTT). Both features have been enabled by default in M131, which was released to Stable on 11/19.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">ORIGIN Frame</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWhen a connection is established for a specific hostname, the server’s certificate typically contains numerous other hostnames for which the server is authoritative. However, a client cannot immediately send requests for those other hostnames on that connection without first performing a DNS lookup for the other hostname and verifying that the IP address of the connection matches the resolved address. This additional DNS resolution introduces latency and significantly reduces the likelihood of connection pooling due to potential IP mismatches. The metrics from Chrome indicate that nearly 20% of HTTP/3 connections would be unnecessary if not for this IP mismatch.\n</p>\n<p>\nCreating a new connection, even with QUIC 0-RTT, is expensive in terms of latency, memory, and CPU usage. This is because:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>DNS resolution adds latency unless cached locally in Chrome’s DNS cache.</li>\n\n<li>Both client and server must send multiple packets to complete a QUIC handshake.</li>\n\n<li>TLS necessitates CPU-intensive asymmetric cryptography on both ends.</li>\n\n<li>The congestion controller begins in its default state, potentially leading to under or over-sending.</li>\n\n<li>0-RTT might fail.</li>\n\n<li>Non-safe requests aren't sent via 0-RTT.</li>\n\n<li>More connections consume more memory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAdditionally, features like HTTP priorities (<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9218/\">RFC 9218</a>) are only effective if there are multiple simultaneous responses to send.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe HTTP/3 ORIGIN Frame (<a href=\"https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9412.html\">RFC 9412</a>) enables a server to indicate what domains it would like to pool onto a connection. Additionally, once the frame is received, it indicates other domains should not be pooled onto that connection, even if they are in the certificate.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Server’s Preferred Address</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nIn some cases, the initial server address to which the client connects is not the most efficient route. It might be behind an L4 load balancer, and connecting directly could increase stability. Particularly when using Anycast, it’s possible the server is distant from where traffic enters the network, creating a 3-legged path that increases the round trip time.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPbECfw3krb6-1DM-wQBsBpPLhcLNGwGVMzEFW_XzUpumvfQzJSvVLJfZ1iwCyowq9QRE2bwl-GsQ8eArforqyyEBadmNN2iwUP59p3Rl428qWPqaJFu2JYe9o7QsuWa20R1s_isnM7efkNIMSetkmnyhFuQOtRt1-7G_e4NNb-BSfXP-DhVB_X5c6QZ0V/s1600/Screenshot%202024-12-17%2012.07.47%20PM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"381\" data-original-width=\"860\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPbECfw3krb6-1DM-wQBsBpPLhcLNGwGVMzEFW_XzUpumvfQzJSvVLJfZ1iwCyowq9QRE2bwl-GsQ8eArforqyyEBadmNN2iwUP59p3Rl428qWPqaJFu2JYe9o7QsuWa20R1s_isnM7efkNIMSetkmnyhFuQOtRt1-7G_e4NNb-BSfXP-DhVB_X5c6QZ0V/s1600/Screenshot%202024-12-17%2012.07.47%20PM.png\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>\nOnce the handshake is confirmed, Server’s Preferred Address allows a server to indicate it would like the client to migrate to a different server IP. Though a QUIC connection is not bound to a single 4-tuple like TCP, this is the only type of migration in RFC9000 where the server can change its address.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo far, only Google’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/media-cdn/docs/overview\">Media CDN</a> has widely enabled advertising an alternative address, but we expect more servers to adopt it soon. Testing has shown that this migration is successful over 99% of the time in Chrome and reduces average RTT by 40-80%.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"post-author\">Posted by Fan Yang and Ian Swett </span>",

Whether it's loading pages quickly, running complex web apps smoothly, or delivering a seamless browsing experience, performance is at the heart of our browser. And we're always looking for ways to make Chrome even faster.\n</p>\n<p>\nOver the last two years, we have been hard at work on a number of <strong>performance improvements for Android devices</strong>. We're excited to share some of the progress we've made.\n</p>\n<h1>Speedometer on Android </h1>\n\n\n<p>\nOne of the key metrics we use to track Chrome's performance is the <a href=\"https://browserbench.org/Speedometer3.0/\">Speedometer benchmark</a>. This benchmark is developed in collaboration with other major web browser engines and measures how quickly Chrome can complete interactions with web pages, including parsing/rendering HTML or CSS and running JavaScript.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince the release of Chrome M112, we've seen a <strong>significant increase in Speedometer 2.1 scores on Android devices [1]</strong>. In fact, on many devices, scores more than doubled, with the newest Snapdragon® 8 Elite Mobile Platform setting new records for Speedometer performance on mobile devices! These huge accomplishments are a testament to the work not only of the Chrome and Android teams, but also our silicon and SoC partners.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7ULeiY7XhUwFlFUcyUnTZc8AorKMA5I5VhW3ENj7chwRB-Sgc_NQWPgNUBLnX7QhRIsBYH-THYueE-lg5hi4CVg_n-yrPvvCIUPXMmHagNT3Y9PpgID8nrwud7UAT5LMMkaHduXeylctnroj7aQHqOUefGucCKoW3MK6sfU1AsJshwEO2EMyfUkR1Vnm9/s1600/s2.1_rel.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1006\" data-original-width=\"1953\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7ULeiY7XhUwFlFUcyUnTZc8AorKMA5I5VhW3ENj7chwRB-Sgc_NQWPgNUBLnX7QhRIsBYH-THYueE-lg5hi4CVg_n-yrPvvCIUPXMmHagNT3Y9PpgID8nrwud7UAT5LMMkaHduXeylctnroj7aQHqOUefGucCKoW3MK6sfU1AsJshwEO2EMyfUkR1Vnm9/s1600/s2.1_rel.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\nSince Chrome M112, Speedometer 2.1 scores have more than doubled on many Android devices. [1]\n</p>\n<h1>How Did We Do It?</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nThe improvements resulted from several changes, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Build optimizations:</strong> We've made a number of changes to the way Chrome is built, which has resulted in faster code execution tuned to modern premium Android devices and SoCs.</li>\n\n<li><strong>V8 and Blink improvements:</strong> Many improvements to the JavaScript engine (V8) and the rendering engine (Blink) have further boosted performance.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Scheduling, OS and SoCs:</strong> We worked closely with Android partners to optimize the way Chrome interacts with the operating system and its thread scheduling to make the best use of the silicon on the devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nLet's take a closer look at each of these areas.\n</p>\n<h1>Build optimizations</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nThe Android device ecosystem is very diverse. From entry-level phones to the newest premium ones, Chrome needs to run well on all devices. Up until last year, we shipped the same Chrome build to all these different Android devices. The memory and disk size constraints on entry-level devices resulted in Chrome having to prioritize a small binary size. Consequently, many modern build optimizations were out of reach, as they resulted in much larger binaries.\n</p>\n<p>\nWith M113, Chrome was finally able to ship a <strong>separate higher-performance build targeting premium Android devices</strong> via the Google Play Store. While we still ship a more binary-size-constrained build to other devices, this approach allowed us to land some of those modern optimizations into the new premium build:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>By targeting 64-bit Arm instead of 32-bit Arm, we can make use of more efficient Arm instruction set features and larger 64-bit operations.</li>\n\n<li>Since binary size is less relevant on premium devices with large disks and sufficient memory, we can now compile C++ code <a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3936329\">optimized for speed</a> (-O2 / -O3) rather than size (-Oz).</li>\n\n<li>Furthermore, we tweaked the inlining thresholds used by the compiler to enable more inlining in hot code (<a href=\"https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/f5361ce9a99a600ec483e2694414d4fb638f1b6a\">within</a> and <a href=\"https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/1cdd49ffd503bac5e6779d48503865bf5a5a0095\">across modules</a>), while updating the model and policy used by another compiler pass (MLGO) to <a href=\"https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/a181985aec42c2547b774cd0e1e8903bd0c797b4\">reduce inlining in cold code</a>.</li>\n\n<li>We now also apply <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/pgo.md\">profile-guided optimization</a> (PGO) techniques to the build to further improve the code layout and optimization level for hot code.</li>\n\n<li>Finally, we improved cross-function code ordering by aligning Chrome's <a\n                                                                       href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/orderfile.md\">orderfile</a> generation with the new 64-bit build.

This progress was facilitated by our collaboration with Arm, who contributed valuable insights and improvements, including to identify and address inefficiencies in Chrome's PGO setup and inlining.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDpBrRfRMVPKZIjnRSAo7Ea1Wsx00QrnL9VJQl7LEqMi3zWC7vLzfNlLY7tbNPjRzhhq44Yt7lxoY0sEA1OstCQKNcS3z6BWdmZpYxj-3UetcQtatu-4xusYX-LJ1sV76axpmvHvQ-dDVrOMJl4QK6tE1h_ACeK7WsWyduJXKZdkEccf7ng_WVEmygS59K/s1600/Screenshot%202024-12-04%202.03.43%20PM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"807\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDpBrRfRMVPKZIjnRSAo7Ea1Wsx00QrnL9VJQl7LEqMi3zWC7vLzfNlLY7tbNPjRzhhq44Yt7lxoY0sEA1OstCQKNcS3z6BWdmZpYxj-3UetcQtatu-4xusYX-LJ1sV76axpmvHvQ-dDVrOMJl4QK6tE1h_ACeK7WsWyduJXKZdkEccf7ng_WVEmygS59K/s1600/Screenshot%202024-12-04%202.03.43%20PM.png\"/></a></div>\n\n<h1>V8 and Blink improvements</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nChrome continuously improves the performance of its JavaScript and web rendering engines, V8 and Blink. Most optimizations are small in individual impact, but stacked together, these improvements add up and contributed most of the remaining Speedometer impact! Notable ones include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>We now utilize an <a href=\"https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/dfbc1a660bbe3a219dbbd61365036009008188ad\">optimized fast-path HTML parser</a> to parse innerHTML attributes.</li>\n\n<li>V8 launched its <em><a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug\">Sparkplug</a></em> compiler tier, a super fast baseline compiler that sits right above its <em>Ignition</em> interpreter and generates non-optimized code very quickly. Later, V8 also launched <em><a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/maglev\">Maglev</a></em>, a new mid-tier compiler that generates semi-optimized code. It takes longer to do so than Sparkplug, but much less time than <em>Turbofan</em>, V8's ultra-optimizing compiler tier. All together, this new tiering hierarchy allows V8 to tier up more gradually, improving both performance and power consumption.</li>\n\n<li>We tuned our heuristics that decide when garbage collection occurs, targeting times <a href=\"https://crbug.com/333981063\">when the rendering engine is idle</a> or <a href=\"https://crbug.com/333423696\">when users navigate away from pages</a>.</li>\n\n<li>We landed many other incremental optimizations, e.g. to V8 and our parsing, style, layout, and text rendering engines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxtu7_F9XtnMIHrTWHIowh8Ok8GpnlgOzz3dGInjQBVv0pD9IV3_u_keDOHQMixrpB5u3cj6rawxhPcLwMacBIYRWSiZ_UDV3VAhPkJ4K4X4KWGSE-1r5GT7sRj6i_JG8fc8ByUYymG6FfWgd6BnXitDZZJtH3w8SRU_RRd9FHvRthBnRwp-ny_9GZukMb/s1600/Screenshot%202024-12-03%203.26.21%20PM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"574\" data-original-width=\"1235\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxtu7_F9XtnMIHrTWHIowh8Ok8GpnlgOzz3dGInjQBVv0pD9IV3_u_keDOHQMixrpB5u3cj6rawxhPcLwMacBIYRWSiZ_UDV3VAhPkJ4K4X4KWGSE-1r5GT7sRj6i_JG8fc8ByUYymG6FfWgd6BnXitDZZJtH3w8SRU_RRd9FHvRthBnRwp-ny_9GZukMb/s1600/Screenshot%202024-12-03%203.26.21%20PM.png\" /></a></div>\n\n<h1>Scheduling and OS</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nTo achieve the best possible performance, Android partners invest heavily in tuning the operating system's thread scheduling and frequency scaling policies, as well as improving the performance of the Silicon itself.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe worked closely with our partners to improve their tuning for Chrome and Speedometer.

    "partialText": "<p>\nLast October, we <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/a-new-way-to-seamlessly-browse-across.html\">introduced</a> a new identity model on iOS (Chrome 118) and are excited to bring it to Android devices and Desktop soon. This model aligns closely with how you already use other Google apps and services.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we first launched <a href=\"https://chrome.googleblog.com/2009/11/bookmark-sync-and-more-speed-in-latest.html\">Chrome sync back in 2009</a>, powered by the Google Account, our goal then, as it is today, was simple: help users access their bookmarks, passwords, tabs and more, across devices. At the time, this was best achieved by a sync model: synchronizing device data with your account and therefore requiring both sign-in and enabling sync.\n</p>\n<p>\nOver the years, the digital world has changed and user expectations have evolved significantly. Cloud services emerged in 2010, and over the past 15 years, the concept of having a digital identity became more prevalent, especially through smartphones and mobile apps. Today, users increasingly expect to just sign in to get access to their stuff and sign out to keep it safe. \n</p>\n<p>\nGiven this evolution of technology and user norms, we’re continuing to make progress on transforming our legacy sync model into one that more seamlessly meets the expectation users have today. From the point of signing in to Chrome you’ll get access to your saved passwords, addresses, and other data from your Google Account. Where relevant, we’ll offer you the choice to sign into Chrome for a customized browsing experience on any device. For example, you can sign in and start to plan a trip on your phone during your commute, and then seamlessly finish it up on any device. Send tabs between your devices, find your bookmarks and use autogenerated passwords with ease. \n</p>\n<p>\nAs always, you have control - we strive to provide an excellent browser experience regardless of whether you choose to sign in or not. Additionally, saving your history and open tabs to your account remains a separate opt-in after signing into Chrome.\n</p>\n<p>\nStay tuned for updates on this change - already on iOS and coming to Android and Desktop soon.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"post-author\">Posted by Claire Charron, Chrome Product Manager </span>",

For example, the SpaceSplitString function is used heavily to turn space-separated strings such as those in “class=’foo bar’ ” into a list representation. In this function we removed some unnecessary bound checks. When we detect that there are duplicated stylesheets, we dedupe them and reference a single stylesheet instance. We made an optimization to reduce the cost of drawing paths and arcs by tuning memory allocations. When creating form editors we detected some unnecessary processing that occurs when form elements are created. Within querySelector, we were able to detect what selector was commonly used and create a hot-path for that. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2023/04/more-ways-were-making-chrome-faster.html\">previously shared</a> how we optimized innerHTML using specialized fast paths for parsing, an implementation that also <a href=\"https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/9926\">made its way into WebKit</a>. Some workloads in Speedometer 3 use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser\">DOMParser</a> so we extended the same optimization for another 1% gain.  \n</p>\n<p>\nWe worked with the Harfbuzz maintainer to also optimize how Chrome renders <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Advanced_Typography#AAT_Layout\">AAT</a> fonts such as those used by Apple Mac OS system fonts. Text starts as a processed stream of unicode characters that is then transformed into a glyph stream that is then run through a state machine defined in the AAT font. The optimization allows us to determine more quickly whether glyphs actually participate in the rules for the state machine, leading to speed-ups when processing text using AAT. \n</p>\n<p>\n \n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">\nPicking the right code to focus on\n</h3>\n<p>\nAn important strategy for achieving high performance is tiering up code, which is picking the right code to further optimize within the engine. Intel contributed profile guided tiering to V8 that remembers tiering decisions from the past such that if a function was stably tiered up in the past, we eagerly tier it up on future runs. \n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">\nImproving garbage collection\n</h3>\n<p>\nAnother area of changes that drove around 3% progression on Speedometer 3 was improvements around garbage collection. V8’s garbage collector has a <a href=\"https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2977741\">long history of making use of renderer idle time</a> to avoid interfering with actual application code. The recent changes follow this spirit by extending existing mechanisms to prefer garbage collection in idle time on otherwise very active renderers where possible. Specifically, DOM finalization code that is run on reclaiming objects is now also run in idle time. Previously, such operations would compete with regular application code over CPU resources. In addition, V8 now supports a much more compact layout for objects that wrap DOM elements, i.e., all objects that are exposed to JavaScript frameworks. The compact layout reduces memory pressure and results in less time spent on garbage collection.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Posted by Thomas Nattestad, Chrome Product Manager</em>\n</p>",

Today’s The Fast and the Curious post explores how we contributed to Core Web Vitals by surveying the field data of Chrome responding to user interactions across all websites, ultimately improving performance of the web. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs billions of people turn to the web to get things done every day, the browser becomes more responsible for hosting a multitude of apps at once, resource contention becomes a challenge. The multi-process Chrome browser contends for multiple resources: CPU and memory of course, but also its own queues of work between its internal services (in this article, the network service).\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is why we’ve been focused on identifying and fixing <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/inp\">slow interactions</a> from Chrome users’ field data, which is the authoritative source when it comes to real user experiences. We gather this field data by recording anonymized Perfetto traces on Chrome Canary, and report them using a privacy-preserving filter.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen looking at field data of slow interactions, one particular cause caught our attention: recurring synchronous calls to fetch the current site’s cookies from the network service. \n</p>\n<p>\nLet’s dive into some history. \n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>\nCookies under an evolving web\n</b></h3>\n<p>\nCookies have been part of the web platform since the very beginning. They are commonly created like this:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">    document.cookie = \"user=Alice;color=blue\"\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>\nAnd later retrieved like this:<br />\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">    // Assuming a `getCookie` helper method:\n    getCookie(\"user\", document.cookie)\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>\nIts implementation was simple in single-process browsers, which kept the cookie jar in memory.\n</p>\n<p>\nOver time, browsers became multi-process, and the process hosting the cookie jar became responsible for answering more and more queries. Because the Web Spec requires Javascript to fetch cookies synchronously, however, answering each <code>document.cookie</code> query is a blocking operation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe operation itself is very fast, so this approach was generally fine, but under heavy load scenarios where multiple websites are requesting cookies (and other resources) from the network service, the queue of requests could get backed up.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe discovered through field traces of slow interactions that some websites were triggering inefficient scenarios with cookies being fetched multiple times in a row. We landed additional metrics to measure how often a <code>GetCookieString()</code> IPC was redundant (same value returned as last time) across all navigations. We were astonished to discover that <strong>87% of cookie accesses were redundant</strong> and that, in some cases, this could happen hundreds of times per second.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe simple design of <code>document.cookie </code>was backfiring as JavaScript on the web was using it like a local value when it was really a remote lookup. Was this a classic computer science case of caching?! Not so fast! \n</p>\n<p>\nThe web spec allows collaborating domains to modify each other’s cookies. Hence, a simple cache per renderer process didn’t work, as it would have prevented writes from propagating between such sites (causing stale cookies and, for example, unsynchronized carts in ecommerce applications).\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">\nA new paradigm: Shared Memory Versioning\n</h3>\n<p>\nWe solved this with a new paradigm which we called <a href=\"https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:mojo/public/cpp/base/shared_memory_version.h\">Shared Memory Versioning</a>. The idea is that each value of <code>document.cookie</code> is now paired with a monotonically increasing version. Each renderer caches its last read of <code>document.cookie</code> alongside that version. The network service hosts the version of each <code>document.cookie</code> in shared memory. Renderers can thus tell whether they have the latest version without having to send an inter-process query to the network service.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhl8OJ82Etmnlpmr2nRzeWSmYBk-2yRPAaDSrftFMxYp-hRkb8ZIxYzIMLG09c9iqHB-dD8UrLj3GaXio7rHjOOpLGY6YBmVYQaex21mqaTGFLSHJVMrUywbU13bvgNeVC0PxiT9sV3Wj33H0Rtr0rzOdHCJBzjQe1IGBjC-8uftmM_D5XBL0CoVMUPZMuU/s7748/Fast%20&amp;%20Curious%20In-Line_Reduce%20cookies%20IPC_V2_HighRes.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"5251\" data-original-width=\"7748\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhl8OJ82Etmnlpmr2nRzeWSmYBk-2yRPAaDSrftFMxYp-hRkb8ZIxYzIMLG09c9iqHB-dD8UrLj3GaXio7rHjOOpLGY6YBmVYQaex21mqaTGFLSHJVMrUywbU13bvgNeVC0PxiT9sV3Wj33H0Rtr0rzOdHCJBzjQe1IGBjC-8uftmM_D5XBL0CoVMUPZMuU/s16000/Fast%20&amp;%20Curious%20In-Line_Reduce%20cookies%20IPC_V2_HighRes.png\" /></a></div><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></p><p>This reduced cookie-related inter-process messages by 80% and made <code>document.cookie</code> accesses 60% faster 🥳.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">\nHypothesis testing\n</h3>\n<p>\nImproving an algorithm is nice, but what we ultimately care about is whether that improvement results in improving slow interactions for users.

    "title": "Manifest V2 phase-out begins",
    "partialText": "<td><em>Update (10/10/2024): We’ve started disabling extensions still using Manifest V2 in Chrome stable. Read more details in the  <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline\">MV2 support timeline documentation</a>.</em>\n</p>\n   </td>\n\n<p>\n\n    In November 2023, we <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3\">shared a timeline</a> for the phasing out of Manifest V2 extensions in Chrome. Based on the progress and feedback we’ve seen from the community, we’re now ready to roll out these changes as scheduled.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n    We’ve always <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2019/06/improving-security-and-privacy-for.html\">been clear</a> that the goal of Manifest V3 is to protect existing functionality while improving the security, privacy, performance and trustworthiness of the extension ecosystem as a whole.  We appreciate the collaboration and feedback from the community that has allowed us - and continues to allow us - to constantly improve the extensions platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n    <strong>Addressing community feedback</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n    We understand migrations of this magnitude can be challenging, which is why we’ve listened to developer feedback and spent years refining Manifest V3 to support the innovation happening across the extensions community. This included adding support for user scripts and introducing offscreen documents to allow extensions to use DOM APIs from a background context. Based on input from the extension community, we also increased the number of rulesets for declarativeNetRequest, allowing extensions to bundle up to 330,000 static rules and dynamically add a further 30,000. You can find more detail in our <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-filtering\">content filtering guide</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This month, we made the transition even easier for extensions using declarativeNetRequest  with the launch of <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/extensions-skip-review-eligible-changes\">review skipping for safe rule updates</a>. If the only changes are for safe modifications to an extension’s static rule list for declarativeNetRequest, Chrome will approve the update in minutes. Coupled with the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-webstore-rollback\">launch of version roll back</a> last month, developers now have greater control over how their updates are deployed.</p>\n<p>\n\n    <strong>Ecosystem progress  </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n    After we addressed the top issues and feature gaps blocking migration last year, we saw an acceleration of extensions migrating successfully to Manifest V3. Over the past year, we’ve even been able to invite some developers - such as Eyeo, the makers of Adblock Plus - and GDE members like Matt Frisbie to share their experiences and insights with the community through <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/eyeos-journey-to-testing-mv3-service%20worker-suspension?hl=en\">guest posts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P-Sc8ZaViY\">YouTube videos</a>. \n</p>\n<p>\n\n    Now, over 85% of actively maintained extensions in the Chrome Web Store are running Manifest V3, and the top content filtering extensions all have Manifest V3 versions available - with options for users of AdBlock, Adblock Plus, uBlock Origin and AdGuard.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n    <strong>What to expect next</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n\n    Starting on June 3 on the Chrome Beta, Dev and Canary channels, if users still have Manifest V2 extensions installed, some will start to see a warning banner when visiting their extension management page - chrome://extensions - informing them that some (Manifest V2) extensions they have installed will soon no longer be supported. At the same time, extensions with the Featured badge that are still using Manifest V2 will lose their badge. \n</p>\n<p>\n\n    This will be followed gradually in the coming months by the disabling of those extensions. Users will be directed to the Chrome Web Store, where they will be recommended Manifest V3 alternatives for their disabled extension. For a short time after the extensions are disabled, users will still be able to turn their Manifest V2 extensions back on, but over time, this toggle will go away as well.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n    Like any big launches, all these changes will begin in pre-stable channel builds of Chrome first – Chrome Beta, Dev, and Canary. The changes will be rolled out over the coming months to Chrome Stable, with the goal of completing the transition by the beginning of next year. Enterprises using the <a href=\"https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#ExtensionManifestV2Availability\">ExtensionManifestV2Availability</a> policy will be exempt from any browser changes until June 2025.\n</p>\n<p>\n\n    We’ve shared more information about the process in our recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvxOW21na48\">Chrome extensions Google I/O talk</a>. If you have any additional questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via the Chromium extensions mailing list.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"post-author\">Posted by David Li, Product Manager, Chrome Extensions</span>",

In <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html\">August</a>, we posted about how Chrome Security is working to protect users from the risk of future quantum computers by leveraging a new form of <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tls-westerbaan-xyber768d00/\">hybrid post-quantum cryptographic key </a>exchange, Kyber (ML-KEM)<sup id=\"fnref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. We’re happy to announce that we have enabled the latest Kyber draft specification by default for TLS 1.3 and QUIC on all desktop Chrome platforms as of Chrome 124.<sup id=\"fnref2\"><a href=\"#fn2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> This rollout revealed a number of previously-existing bugs in several TLS middlebox products. To assist with the deployment of fixes, Chrome is offering a temporary <a href=\"https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled\">enterprise policy to opt-out</a>.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nLaunching opportunistic quantum-resistant key exchange is part of <a href=\"https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography\">Google’s broader strategy</a> to prioritize deploying post-quantum cryptography in systems <em>today</em> that are at risk if an adversary has access to a quantum computer <em>in the future</em>. We believe that it’s important to inform standards with real-world experience, by implementing drafts and iterating based on feedback from implementers and early adopters. This iterative approach was a key part of developing QUIC and TLS 1.3. It’s part of why we’re launching this draft version of Kyber, and it informs our future plans for post-quantum cryptography.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nChrome’s post-quantum strategy prioritizes quantum-resistant key exchange in HTTPS, and increased <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/\">agility</a> in certificates from the Web PKI. While PKI agility may appear somewhat unrelated, its absence has contributed to significant delays in past cryptographic transitions and will continue to do so until we find a viable solution in this space. A more agile Web PKI is required to enable a secure and reliable transition to post-quantum cryptography on the web.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nTo understand this, let’s take a look at HTTPS and the current state of post-quantum cryptography. In the context of HTTPS, cryptography is primarily used in three different ways:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n\n<li><strong>Symmetric Encryption/Decryption.</strong> HTTP is transmitted as data inside a TLS connection using an authenticated cipher (AEAD) such as AES-GCM. These algorithms are <a href=\"https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/post-quantum-age/\">broadly considered safe</a> against quantum cryptanalysis and can remain in place.\n\n\n</li><li><strong>Key Exchange.</strong> Symmetric cryptography requires a secret key. Key exchange is a form of asymmetric cryptography in which two parties can mutually generate a shared secret key over a public channel. This secret key can then be used for symmetric encryption and decryption. All current forms of asymmetric key exchange standardized for use in TLS are vulnerable to quantum cryptanalysis. \n\n\n</li><li><strong>Authentication</strong>. In HTTPS, authentication is achieved primarily through the use of digital signatures, which are used to convey server identity, handshake authentication, and transparency for certificate issuance. All of the digital signature and public key algorithms standardized for authentication in TLS are vulnerable to quantum cryptanalysis.\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\nThis results in two separate quantum threats to HTTPS.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe first is the threat to traffic being generated <em>today</em>. An adversary could store encrypted traffic now, wait for a CRQC to be practical, and then use it to decrypt the traffic after the fact. This is commonly known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later\">store-now-decrypt-later</a> attack. This threat is relatively urgent, since it doesn’t matter when a CRQC is practical—the threat comes from storing encrypted data <em>now</em>. Defending against this attack requires the key exchange to be quantum resistant. Launching Kyber in Chrome enables servers to mitigate store-now-decrypt-later attacks.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe second threat is that <em>future</em> traffic is vulnerable to impersonation by a quantum computer. Once a CRQC actually exists, it could be used to break the asymmetric cryptography used for authentication in HTTPS. To defend against impersonation from a CRQC, we need to migrate all of the asymmetric cryptography used for authentication to post-quantum variants. However, breaking authentication only affects traffic generated <strong>after</strong> the availability of CRQCs. This is because breaking authentication on a recorded transcript doesn’t help the attacker impersonate either party—the conversation has already finished. \n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nIn other words, there’s no store-now-decrypt-later equivalent for authentication, and so while migrating key exchange and authentication to post-quantum variants are both <em>important</em>, migrating authentication is less <em>urgent</em> than key exchange. This is good, because there are a <a href=\"https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/pqc-signatures-2024/\">variety of challenges</a> for migrating to post-quantum authentication. Specifically, size.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nPost-quantum cryptography is big compared to the pre-quantum cryptographic algorithms used in HTTPS. A Kyber key exchange is ~1KB transmitted per peer, whereas an X25519 key exchange is only 32 bytes per peer, an over 30x increase. The actual key exchange operation in Kyber is quite fast. Transmitting Kyber keys is quite slow. The extra size from Kyber causes the TLS ClientHello to be split into two packets, resulting in a 4% median latency increase to all TLS handshakes in Chrome on desktop. On desktop platforms, this, with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connection reuse, is not large enough to be noticeable in <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/vitals\">Core Web Vitals</a>. Unfortunately, it is noticeable on Android, where Internet connections are often lower bandwidth and higher latency, and so we have not yet launched on Android.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe size issues are even worse for authentication. ML-DSA (Dilithium) keys and signatures are ~40X the size of ECDSA keys and signatures. A typical TLS connection today uses two public keys and five signatures to fulfill all of the authentication requirements. A naive swap to ML-DSA would add ~14KB to the TLS handshake. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024\">Cloudflare anticipates</a> it would increase latency by 20-40%, and we’ve seen that a single kilobyte was already impactful.  Instead, we need alternate approaches to authentication in HTTPS that provide the desired properties and transmit fewer signatures and public keys.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n\t\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nWe think the important next step for quantum-resistant authentication in HTTPS is to focus on enabling <em>trust anchor agility</em>. Historically, the public Web PKI could not deploy new algorithms quickly. This is because most site operators typically provision a single certificate for all supported clients and browsers. This certificate must both be issued from a trust hierarchy that is trusted by every browser or client the site operator supports, and the certificate must be compatible with each of these clients.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe single certificate model makes it difficult for the Web PKI to evolve. As security requirements change, site operators may find that there is no longer an intersection between certificates trusted by deployed clients, certificates trusted by new clients, algorithms supported by deployed clients, and algorithms supported by new clients (all crossed with every separate browser and root store). These clients may range from different browsers, older versions of those browsers not receiving updates, all the way to applications on smart TVs or payment terminals. As requirements diverge, site operators have to choose between security for new clients, and compatibility with older clients.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis conflict, in turn, limits new clients making PKI changes to improve user security, such as transitioning to post-quantum. Under a single-certificate deployment model, the newest clients cannot diverge too far from the oldest clients, or server operators will be left with no way to maintain compatibility. We propose to solve this by moving to a <em>multi-certificate deployment model</em>, where servers may be provisioned with multiple certificates, and automatically send the correct one to each client.   This enables trust anchor agility, and allows clients to evolve at different rates. Clients who are up to date and reliably receiving updates could access the authentication mechanisms best suited for the Internet as it evolves without being hamstrung by old clients no longer receiving updates. Certification authorities and trust stores could introduce new post-quantum trust anchors without needing to wait for the slowest actor to add support. This would drastically simplify the post-quantum transition since it also enables the seamless addition and removal of hierarchies using experimental post-quantum authentication methods.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAt first glance, TLS may appear to have trust anchor agility by way of <em>cross-signatures</em> and <em>signature algorithm negotiation</em>. However, neither of these mechanisms provide true trust anchor agility, nor were they intended to. \n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nA cross-signature is when a CA creates two different certificates for a single subject and public key pair, but with different issuers and signatures. The first certificate is issued and signed as usual, by the CA itself. The second is issued and signed by a different trust hierarchy, often by a different organization. For example, the original Let’s Encrypt intermediate certificate <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html\">existed in two forms</a><sup id=\"fnref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>. The “regular” intermediate was signed by the Let’s Encrypt root, whereas the “cross-signed” intermediate was signed by IdenTrust. This approach of cross-signing a new PKI hierarchy with an older, more broadly available PKI hierarchy allows a new CA to bootstrap its trust on old devices, so long as the older devices support the signing algorithm. Cross-signatures, however, rely on significant cooperation among often competing CAs, and may not be suitable for when different clients have different needs. This limits when site operators can use cross-signs. Additionally, devices that do not support a new algorithm will still need to be updated to be able to use the new signing algorithm in the newer certificate, regardless of whether or not it is cross-signed. \n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSignature algorithm negotiation allows TLS peers to agree on the algorithm to be used for the handshake signature. This algorithm needs to correspond with the key type used in the certificate. Endpoints can infer that if the peer supports an algorithm such as ECDSA for the handshake signature, it must also support ECDSA certificates. This value can be used to multiplex between an RSA-based chain and a smaller ECDSA-based chain. For example, Google’s RSA-based large compatibility chain is four certificates and ~4.1KB, whereas the shortest ECDSA-based chain is three certificates and only ~1.7KB<sup id=\"fnref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>. \n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nSignature algorithm negotiation does not provide trust anchor agility. While the signature algorithm information implies algorithm support, it provides no information about what trust anchors a client actually trusts. A client can support ECDSA, but not have the latest ECDSA root certificate from a specific CA. Due to the wide variety of trust stores in use, many organizations may still often need to be conservative in when they serve ECDSA certificates and may need to provide a longer, cross-signed chain for maximum compatibility.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nNeither cross-signatures nor signature algorithm negotiation are solutions to migrating to post-quantum cryptography for authentication. Cross-signatures do not help with new algorithms, and signature algorithm negotiation is solely about negotiating algorithms, not providing information about trust anchors. We expect a gradual transition to post-quantum cryptography. Inferring information about the contents of the trust store from the result of signature algorithm negotiation risks ossifying to a specific version of a specific trust store, rather than purely being used for algorithm negotiation.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nInstead, to introduce agility to TLS we need an explicit mechanism for <em>trust anchor negotiation</em>, to allow the client and server to efficiently determine which certificate to use.  At the November 2023 IETF meeting in Prague, Chrome proposed “<a href=\"https://github.com/davidben/tls-trust-expressions\">Trust Expressions</a>” as a mechanism for trust anchor negotiation in TLS. Chrome is currently seeking community input on Trust Expressions via the IETF process. We think the goal of being able to cleanly deploy multiple certificates to handle a range of clients is much more important than the specific mechanisms of the proposal.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nFrom there, we can explore more efficient ways to authenticate servers, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/davidben/merkle-tree-certs\">Merkle Tree Certificates</a>. We view introducing some mechanism for trust anchor agility as a necessity for efficient post-quantum authentication. Experimentation will be extremely important as proposals are developed. Agility also enables using different solutions in different contexts, rather than sending extra data for the lowest-common denominator— solutions like Merkle Tree Certificates and <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-davidben-tls-trust-expr-02.html#name-intermediate-elision\">intermediate elision</a> require up-to-date clients.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nGiven these constraints, priorities, and <a href=\"https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/pqc-not-plaintext/\">risks</a>, we think agility is more important than defining exactly what a post-quantum PKI will look like at this time. We recommend against <em>immediately</em> standardizing ML-DSA in X.509 for use in the <em>public</em> Web PKI via the <a href=\"https://cabforum.org/\">CA/Browser Forum</a>. We expect that ML-DSA, once NIST completes standardization, will play a part in a post-quantum Web PKI, but we’re focusing on agility first. This does not preclude introducing ML-DSA in X.509 as an option for private PKIs, which may be operating on more strict post-quantum timelines and have fewer constraints around certificate size, handshake latency, issuance transparency, and unmanaged endpoints.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nUltimately, we think that any approach to post-quantum authentication has the same first requirement—a migration mechanism for clients to opt-in to post-quantum secure authentication mechanisms when servers support it. Post-quantum authentication presents significant challenges to the Web ecosystem, but we believe trust anchor agility will enable us to overcome them and lead to a more secure, robust, and performant post-quantum web.\n\n</p>\n\n\n<!--Footnotes themselves at the bottom.-->\n\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol><li id=\"fn1\">\n\n<p>\n\n     The draft is X25519Kyber768, which is a combination of the pre-quantum algorithm X25519, and the post-quantum algorithm Kyber 768.

In the future, these models will also help improve the relevance scoring of search suggestions. Here’s a closer look at some of the important insights that help our team build this integration and where we hope the new model takes us.    \n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How we got here</strong></h3>\n<p>\nAs the engineering lead for the team responsible for the omnibox, every launch feels special, but this one is truly near and dear to my heart. When I first started working on the Chrome omnibox, I asked around for ideas on how we could make it better for users. The number one answer I heard was, \"improve the scoring system.\" The issue wasn't that the scoring was bad. In fact, the omnibox often feels magical in its ability to surface the URL or query you want! The issue was that it was <em>inflexible</em>. A set of hand-built and hand-tuned formulas did the job well, but were difficult to improve or to adapt to new scenarios. As a result, the scoring system went largely untouched for a long time.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor most of that time, an ML-trained scoring model was the obvious path forward. But it took many false starts to finally get here. Our inability to tackle this challenge for so long was due to the difficulty of replacing the core mechanism of a feature used literally billions of times every day. Software engineering projects are sometimes described as \"building the plane while flying it.\" This project felt more like \"replacing all the seats in every plane in the world while they're all flying.\" The scale was enormous and the changes are felt directly by every user.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis ambitious undertaking would not have been possible without the work of such a talented and dedicated team. There were bumps in the road, walls we had to break through, and unanticipated issues that slowed us down, but the team was driven by a sincere belief in the impact of getting this right for our users.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A Surprising Insight</strong></h3>\n<p>\nOne of the fun things about working with ML systems is that the training considers <em>all</em> the data at a scale that would be difficult to impossible for any individual person or team. And that can lead to surprising insights. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe coolest example of this phenomenon on this project was when we looked at the scoring curve of one particular signal: time since last navigation. The expectation with this signal is that the smaller it is (the more recently you've navigated to a particular URL), the bigger the contribution that signal should make towards a higher relevance score. \n</p>\n<p>\nAnd that is, in fact, what the model learned. But when we looked closer, we noticed something surprising: when the time since navigation was very low (seconds instead of hours, days or weeks), the model was <em>decreasing</em> the relevance score. It turns out that the training data reflected a pattern where users sometimes navigate to a URL that was not what they really wanted and then immediately return to the Chrome omnibox and try again. In that case, the URL they just navigated to is almost certainly <em>not</em> what they want, so it should receive a low relevance score during this second attempt.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn retrospect, this is obvious. And if we had not launched ML scoring, we definitely would have added a new rule to the old system to reflect this scenario. But before the training system observed and learned from this pattern, it never occurred to anyone that this might be happening.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Future</strong></h3>\n<p>\nWith the new ML models, we believe this will open up many new possibilities to improve the user experience by potentially incorporating new signals, like differentiating between time of the day to improve relevance. We want to explore training specialized versions of the model for particular environments: for example, mobile, enterprise or academic users, or perhaps different locales.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, we observe that the way users interact with the Chrome omnibox changes over time and we believe the relevance scoring should change with them. With the new scoring system, we can now simply collect fresher signals, re-train, evaluate, and deploy new models periodically over time.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><span>By Justin Donnelly, Chrome software engineer </span></em>\n</p>",

    "title": "Fighting cookie theft using device bound sessions",
    "partialText": "<p>\nCookies – small files created by sites you visit – are fundamental to the modern web. They make your online experience easier by saving browsing information, so that sites can do things like keep you signed in and remember your site preferences. Due to their powerful utility, cookies are also a lucrative target for attackers.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany users across the web are victimized by <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/\">cookie theft malware</a> that gives attackers access to their web accounts. Operators of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) frequently use social engineering to spread cookie theft malware. These operators even convince users to bypass multiple warnings in order to land the malware on their device. The malware then typically exfiltrates all authentication cookies from browsers on the device to remote servers, enabling the attackers to curate and sell the compromised accounts. Cookie theft like this happens <em>after</em> login, so it bypasses two-factor authentication and any other login-time reputation checks. It’s also difficult to mitigate via anti-virus software since the stolen cookies continue to work even after the malware is detected and removed. And because of the way cookies and operating systems interact, primarily on desktop operating systems, Chrome and other browsers cannot protect them against malware that has the same level of access as the browser itself. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo address this problem, we’re prototyping a new web capability called Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) that will help keep users more secure against cookie theft. The project is being developed in the open at <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/dbsc\">github.com/WICG/dbsc</a> with the goal of becoming an open web standard. \n</p>\n<p>\nBy binding authentication sessions to the device, DBSC aims to disrupt the cookie theft industry since exfiltrating these cookies will no longer have any value. We think this will substantially reduce the success rate of cookie theft malware. Attackers would be forced to act locally on the device, which makes on-device detection and cleanup more effective, both for anti-virus software as well as for enterprise managed devices.\n</p>\n<p>\nLearning from prior work, our goal is to build a technical solution that’s practical to deploy to all sites large and small, to foster industry support to ensure broad adoption, and to maintain user privacy.\n</p>\n<h2>Technical solution</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nAt a high level, the DBSC API lets a server start a new session with a specific browser on a device. When the browser starts a new session, it creates a new public/private key pair locally on the device, and uses the operating system to safely store the private key in a way that makes it hard to export. Chrome will use facilities such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) for key protection, which are becoming more commonplace and are required for Windows 11, and we are looking at supporting <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/advancing-key-protection-in-windows-using-vbs/ba-p/4050988\">software-isolated solutions</a> as well.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe API allows a server to associate a session with this public key, as a replacement or an augmentation to existing cookies, and verify proof-of-possession of the private key throughout the session lifetime. To make this feasible from a latency standpoint and to aid migrations of existing cookie-based solutions, DBSC uses these keys to maintain the freshness of short-lived cookies through a dedicated DBSC-defined endpoint on the website. This happens out-of-band from regular web traffic, reducing the changes needed to legacy websites and apps. This ensures the session is still on the same device, enforcing it at regular intervals set by the server. For current implementation details please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/dbsc/blob/main/README.md\">public explainer</a>. \n</p>\n<h2>Preserving user privacy</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nEach session is backed by a unique key and DBSC does not enable sites to correlate keys from different sessions on the same device, to ensure there's no persistent user tracking added. The user can delete the created keys at any time by deleting site data in Chrome settings. The out-of-band refresh of short-term cookies is only performed if a user is actively using the session (e.g. browsing the website).\n</p>\n<p>\nDBSC doesn’t leak any meaningful information about the device beyond the fact that the browser thinks it can offer some type of secure storage. The only information sent to the server is the per-session public key which the server uses to certify proof of key possession later. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe expect Chrome will initially support DBSC for roughly half of desktop users, based on the current hardware capabilities of users' machines. We are committed to developing this standard in a way that ensures it will not be abused to segment users based on client hardware. For example, we may consider supporting software keys for all users regardless of hardware capabilities. This would ensure that DBSC will not let servers differentiate between users based on hardware features or device state (i.e. if a device is <a href=\"https://www.android.com/certified/\">Play Protect certified</a> or not).\n</p>\n<p>\nDBSC will be fully aligned with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd\">the phase-out of third-party cookies in Chrome</a>. In third-party contexts, DBSC will have the same availability and/or segmentation that third-party cookies will, as set by user preferences and other factors. This is to make sure that DBSC does not become a new tracking vector once third-party cookies are phased out, while also ensuring that such cookies can be fully protected in the meantime. If the user completely opts out of cookies, third-party cookies, or cookies for a specific site, this will disable DBSC in those scenarios as well.\n</p>\n<h2>Improving user protection </h2>\n\n\n<p>\nWe are currently experimenting with a DBSC prototype to protect some Google Account users running Chrome Beta. This is an early initiative to gauge the reliability, feasibility, and the latency of the protocol on a complex site, while also providing meaningful protection to our users. When it’s deployed fully, consumers and enterprise users will get upgraded security for their Google accounts under the hood automatically. We are also working to enable this technology for our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers to provide another layer of account security.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis prototype is integrated with the way Chrome and Google Accounts work together, but is validating and informing all aspects of the public API we want to build.\n</p>\n<h2>Interest outside Google</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nMany server providers, identity providers (IdPs) such as Okta, and browsers such as Microsoft Edge have expressed interest in DBSC as they want to secure their users against cookie theft. We are engaging with all interested parties to make sure we can present a standard that works for different kinds of websites in a privacy preserving way.\n</p>\n<h2>Where to follow the progress</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nDevelopment happens on <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/dbsc\">GitHub</a> and we have published an <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/dbsc/wiki/DBSC-timeline\">estimated timeline</a>. This is where we will post announcements and updates to the expected timelines as needed. Our goal is to allow <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/origin-trials\">origin trials</a> for all interested websites by the end of 2024. Please reach out if you'd like to get involved. We welcome feedback from all sources, either by opening a <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/dbsc/issues\">new issue</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/dbsc/discussions\">starting a discussion</a> on GitHub.\n</p>\n<span class=\"post-author\">Posted by Kristian Monsen, Chrome Counter Abuse </span>",

Benchmarks, like Speedometer, are tools that can help browser vendors find opportunities to improve performance. Ideally, they simulate functionality that users encounter on typical websites, to ensure browsers can optimize areas that are beneficial to users.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet’s dig into the new changes in Speedometer 3.0. \n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Applying a multi-stakeholder governance model</strong></h3>\n<p>\nSince its initial release in <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/3395/speedometer-benchmark-for-web-app-responsiveness/\">2014</a> by the WebKit team, browser vendors have successfully used Speedometer to optimize their engines and improve user experiences on the web. Speedometer 2.0,  a result of a collaboration between Apple and Chrome, followed in <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/8063/speedometer-2-0-a-benchmark-for-modern-web-app-responsiveness/\">2018</a>, and it included an updated set of workloads that were more representative of the modern web at that time.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe web has changed a lot since 2018, and so has Speedometer in its latest release, Speedometer 3. This work has been based on a joint <a href=\"https://github.com/WebKit/Speedometer/blob/main/Governance.md\">multi-stakeholder governance model</a> to share work, and build a collaborative understanding of performance on the web to help drive browser performance in ways that help users. The goal of this collaborative project is to create a shared understanding of web performance so that improvements can be made to enhance the user experience.  Together, we were able to to improve how Speedometer captures and calculates scores, show more detailed results and introduce an even wider variety of workloads. This cross-browser collaboration introduced more diverse perspectives that enabled clearer insights into a broader set of web users and workflows, ensuring the newest version of Speedometer will help make the web better for everyone, regardless of which browser they use.\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Why is building workloads challenging?</strong></h3>\n<p>\nBuilding a reliable benchmark with representative tests and workloads is challenging enough. That task becomes even more challenging if it will be used as a tool to guide optimization of browser engines over multiple years. To develop the  Speedometer 3 benchmark, the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/aurora\">Chrome Aurora</a> team, together with colleagues from other participating browser vendors, were tasked with finding new workloads  that accurately reflect what users experience across the vast, diverse and eclectic web of 2024 and beyond. \n</p>\n<p>\nA few tests and workloads can’t simulate the entire web, but while building Speedometer 3 we have established some criteria for selecting ones that are critical to user’s experience. We are now closer to a representative benchmark than ever before. Let’s take a look at how Speedometer workloads evolved\n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>How did the workloads change?</strong></h3>\n<p>\nSince the goal is to use workloads that are representative of the web today, we needed to take a look at the previous workloads used in Speedometer and determine what changes were necessary. We needed to decide which frameworks are still relevant, which apps needed updating and what types of work we didn’t capture in previous versions. In Speedometer 2, all workloads were variations of a todo app implemented in different JS frameworks. We found that, as the web evolved over the past six years, we missed out on various JavaScript and Browser APIs that became popular, and apps tend to be much larger and more complicated than before. As a result, we made changes to the list of frameworks we included and we added a wider variety of workloads that cover a broader range of APIs and features. \n</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Frameworks</strong></h3>\n<p>\nTo determine which frameworks to include, we used data from <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/\">HTTP Archive</a> and discussed inclusion with all browser vendors to ensure we cover a good range of implementations. For the initial evaluation, we took a snapshot of the HTTP Archive from March 2023 to determine the top JavaScript UI frameworks currently used to build complex web apps.\n</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNL-3EGN3NyWERFEqb-GnA5UnYi_lDkyp1siFYN5X0qj6qAQWpMcwrC7_3Q0PQPeQCsbQf06FDp6e_RaNB-U6nvnf1JxljO1nUeZxSSAoqmyu2-9VNGP1QjNx6krI8W7EhdmDHyg8_kvzPm7Vf0Xjo1uPKl84R-mrDwXqbY1xf0EkMSHvtu2mcMwGCgxZ7/s1932/1Chrome_Fast%20&amp;%20Curious_Blog%20Assets_Speedometer%203.0_v2_Pages%20vs.%20Framework.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1351\" data-original-width=\"1932\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNL-3EGN3NyWERFEqb-GnA5UnYi_lDkyp1siFYN5X0qj6qAQWpMcwrC7_3Q0PQPeQCsbQf06FDp6e_RaNB-U6nvnf1JxljO1nUeZxSSAoqmyu2-9VNGP1QjNx6krI8W7EhdmDHyg8_kvzPm7Vf0Xjo1uPKl84R-mrDwXqbY1xf0EkMSHvtu2mcMwGCgxZ7/s16000/1Chrome_Fast%20&amp;%20Curious_Blog%20Assets_Speedometer%203.0_v2_Pages%20vs.%20Framework.png\" /></a></div><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></p>\n<p>\nAnother approach is to determine inclusion based on popularity with developers: Do we need to include frameworks that have “momentum”, where a framework's current usage in production might be low, but we anticipate growth in adoption?

One data point to evaluate momentum might be monthly NPM downloads of frameworks. \n</p>\n<p>\nHere are the same 15 frameworks NPM downloads for March 2023:\n</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhh9SdoPfDPz-wjCUTknvTaTq4D3pRTUDocU7BoUF-y8iePqktwFxZXUgkAkeWF4gG8kJIIXSTJL_-ugHzrW8LnsyFdlCCEz_MleUtADMnyhU6Nlztk_RPw2J9t7dWTtzIad2eB3U9IGOMXMyb-QB4j_26bmL77oUIThz3Otp5FBSPXmn_rG8bumjBpuTj1/s1932/2Chrome_Fast%20&amp;%20Curious_Blog%20Assets_Speedometer%203.0_Downloads%20vs.%20Framework.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1360\" data-original-width=\"1932\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhh9SdoPfDPz-wjCUTknvTaTq4D3pRTUDocU7BoUF-y8iePqktwFxZXUgkAkeWF4gG8kJIIXSTJL_-ugHzrW8LnsyFdlCCEz_MleUtADMnyhU6Nlztk_RPw2J9t7dWTtzIad2eB3U9IGOMXMyb-QB4j_26bmL77oUIThz3Otp5FBSPXmn_rG8bumjBpuTj1/s16000/2Chrome_Fast%20&amp;%20Curious_Blog%20Assets_Speedometer%203.0_Downloads%20vs.%20Framework.png\" /></a></div><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></p>\n<p>\nWith both data points on hand, we decided on a list that we felt gives us a good representation of frameworks.

It’s a popular resource for learning and offers a wide range of TodoMVC implementations with different frameworks. \n</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3uqFby4YGbOdvIEo3mgb6EjFO4q9OtRNagMiDOEcTzVFyzrMeJCKoab-U4fyKVQr7rfbfTzTgCmbNxgy84pl3-bfvsfVmC6mqBYcxNB739yNTlYORwySDsKmNRIjdjwivLcpI6iG6CzGOz7x2Gy0gq1LIgRCgIJi2neq1nQWfo0G07plVTRF3E6nGs_2q/s842/1TodoMVC.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"706\" data-original-width=\"842\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3uqFby4YGbOdvIEo3mgb6EjFO4q9OtRNagMiDOEcTzVFyzrMeJCKoab-U4fyKVQr7rfbfTzTgCmbNxgy84pl3-bfvsfVmC6mqBYcxNB739yNTlYORwySDsKmNRIjdjwivLcpI6iG6CzGOz7x2Gy0gq1LIgRCgIJi2neq1nQWfo0G07plVTRF3E6nGs_2q/s16000/1TodoMVC.png\" /></a></div><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></p>\n<p>\nTodoMVC is a to-do application that allows a user to keep track of tasks. The user can enter a new task, update an existing one, mark a task as completed, or delete it. In addition to the basic CRUD operations, the TodoMVC app has some added functionality: filters are available to change the view to “all”, “active” or “completed” tasks and a status text displays the number of active tasks to complete. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn Speedometer, we introduced a local data source for todo items, which we use in our tests to populate the todo apps. This gave us the opportunity to test a larger character set with different languages.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe tests for these apps are all similar and are relatable to typical user journeys with a todo app:\n</p>\n<ol>\n\n<li>Add a task\n\n</li><li>Mark task as complete\n\n</li><li>Delete task\n\n</li><li>Repeat steps 1-3 a set amount of times\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThese tests seem simple, but it lets us benchmark DOM manipulations. Having a variety of framework implementations also cover several different ways how this can be done. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>Complex DOM / TodoMVC</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe complex DOM workloads embed various TodoMVC implementations in a static UI shell that mimics a complex web page. The idea is to capture the performance impact on executing seemingly isolated actions (e.g. adding/deleting todo items) in the context of a complex website. Small performance hits that aren’t obvious in an isolated TodoMVC workload are amplified in a larger application and therefore capture more real-world impact.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe tests are similar to the TodoMVC tests, executed in the complex DOM &amp; CSSOM environment.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis introduces an additional layer of complexity that browsers have to be able to handle effortlessly.\n</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigyFShRHZAVX8SzN0eRf1XyOPAwT1563BKuuzaOYSlG8-rVaeSqGj88DFM3bsiJmveZ5z-XB-2jaZp8Exz6NTvf1wQbN1vmouCnSbMV8QtXbWpsbbAhEFQOk0zuhTxOkUfbcDadVy6nbQ7HhjgsmQEghoO_v3v8FMnsCB7ZWWzk8YsZXeXZbD8zWbItd33/s822/2Complex%20DOM%20%20TodoMVC.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"694\" data-original-width=\"822\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigyFShRHZAVX8SzN0eRf1XyOPAwT1563BKuuzaOYSlG8-rVaeSqGj88DFM3bsiJmveZ5z-XB-2jaZp8Exz6NTvf1wQbN1vmouCnSbMV8QtXbWpsbbAhEFQOk0zuhTxOkUfbcDadVy6nbQ7HhjgsmQEghoO_v3v8FMnsCB7ZWWzk8YsZXeXZbD8zWbItd33/s16000/2Complex%20DOM%20%20TodoMVC.png\" /></a></div><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>Single-page-applications (News Site)</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nSingle-page-applications (SPAs) are widely used on the web for streaming, gaming, social media and pretty much anything you can imagine. A SPA lets us capture navigating between pages and interacting with an app. We chose a news site to represent a SPA, since it allows us to capture the main areas of interest in a deterministic way. An important factor was that we want to ensure we are using static local data and that the app doesn’t rely on network requests to present this data to the user.\n</p>\n<p>\nTwo implementations are included: one built with Next.js and the other with Nuxt.

It is based on D3, which is a JavaScript library for visualizing tabular data and outputs SVG elements. It loops through a big dataset to build the source data that D3 needs, using map, filter and flatMap methods. As a result this exercises creation and copying of objects and arrays.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chart.js</strong> is a JavaScript charting library. The included workload displays a scatter graph with the canvas api, both with some transparency and with full opacity. This uses the same data as the previous workload, but with a different preparation phase. In this case it makes a heavy use of trigonometry to compute distances between airports.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>React Stockcharts</strong> displays a dashboard for stocks. It is based on D3 for all computation, but outputs SVG directly using React.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Webkit Perf-Dashboard</strong> is an application used to track various performance metrics of WebKit. The dashboard uses canvas drawing and web components for its ui.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese workloads test DOM manipulation with SVG or canvas by interacting with charts. For example here are the interactions of the Observable Plot workload:<br />\n</p>\n<ol>\n\n<li>Prepare data: compute the input datasets to output structures that D3 understands.\n\n</li><li>Add stacked chart: this draws a chart using SVG elements.\n\n</li><li>Change input slider to change the computation parameters.\n\n</li><li>Repeat steps 1 and 2\n\n</li><li>Reset: this clears the view\n\n</li><li>Add dotted chart: this draws another type of graph (dots instead of bars) to exercise different drawing primitives.

To that end, we'd like to announce a few recent changes to how Chrome works with Google Safe Browsing to keep you safe online while optimizing for smooth and uninterrupted web browsing.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><br /></span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">Asynchronous checks</span></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><br /></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Today, Safe Browsing checks are on the blocking path of page loads in Chrome, meaning that users cannot see pages until checks are completed. While this works fine for local-first checks such as those made using </span><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"color: #1155cc; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Safe Browsing API v4</span></a><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">, it can add latency for checks made directly with the Safe Browsing server. Starting in Chrome 122, we will begin to introduce an asynchronous mechanism which will allow sites to load even while real-time checks with Safe Browsing servers are in progress. We expect this to reduce page load time and improve user experience as real-time server-side checks will no longer block page load, although if a site is found to be dangerous after the page loads then a warning will still be shown.</span></span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">In addition to the performance boost, this change will let us improve the quality of protection over time. By taking the remote lookup outside of the blocking path of the page load, we're now able to experiment with and deploy novel AI and ML based algorithms to detect and block more phishing and social engineering attacks. It was previously challenging to perform such experimentation because of the potential to delay page loads.</span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">In terms of potential risks, we evaluated the following and concluded that sufficient mitigations are in place:</span></p><div><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span></div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9a89d10b-7fff-7a14-97bb-c03f9c6672d0\" style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><ul style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-inline-start: 48px;\"><li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; list-style-type: disc; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 700; text-wrap: wrap; vertical-align: baseline;\">Phishing and social engineering attacks</span><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-wrap: wrap; vertical-align: baseline;\">: With the move to asynchronous checks, such sites may start to load while server-side Safe Browsing checks are in progress. We have studied the timing data and concluded that it is extremely unlikely a user would have significantly interacted with (e.g. typed in a password) such a site by the time a warning is shown.</span></p></li><li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #434343; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; list-style-type: disc; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"color: black; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 700; text-wrap: wrap; vertical-align: baseline;\">Exploits against the browser</span><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"color: black; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-wrap: wrap; vertical-align: baseline;\">: Chrome maintains a local Safe Browsing list of some sites which are known to deliver browser exploits, and we'll continue to check that synchronously.

These sub-resources can include images, scripts, and more. Chrome has historically checked both top-level URLs as well as sub-resources with Safe Browsing in order to warn on potentially harmful sites. While the majority of sub-resources are safe, in the past, we'd commonly observe compromised sites embedding sub-resources that were being leveraged by bad actors to distribute malware and exploit browsers at scale.</span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">In recent years, we've seen this attacker trend decline –&nbsp;large scale campaigns that exploit sub-resources are no longer common, making sub-resource checks less important. Additionally, our advances in intelligence gathering, threat detection, and Safe Browsing APIs mean that we now have other ways to protect users in real-time without relying on sub-resource checks. For example, Chrome’s client-side visual ML model can spot images used to create phishing pages, regardless of their use of sub-resources.</span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">As such, moving forward Chrome will no longer check the URLs of sub-resources with Safe Browsing. This means that Chrome clients now connect to Google less frequently, which reduces unnecessary network bandwidth cost for users. On the Safe Browsing side, the change allows us to drastically simplify detection logic and APIs, which helps improve infrastructure reliability and warning accuracy, thus reducing risk overall.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><br /></span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">PDF download checks</span></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><br /></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Finally, we have vastly reduced the frequency with which Chrome contacts Safe Browsing to check PDF downloads.</span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">In the past, PDF was a widely exploited file type due to its popularity. As time has passed, thanks in part to the ongoing hardening of PDF viewers (for example, Chrome's PDF viewer is sandboxed), we aren't seeing widespread exploitation of PDF anymore, nor do we hear industry reports about it being a dangerous file type. Even when we have observed malicious PDFs in the wild, they have contained links that redirect users back to Chrome which gives us another chance to protect users.</span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">As a result of this change, Chrome is now contacting Safe Browsing billions of times less often each week.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><br /></span></p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;\">What to expect</span></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><br /></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">The changes described above, while mostly under the hood, should result in a smoother web browsing experience for Chrome users without a degradation in security posture.

For example, tools like Chrome sync have made it possible for you to access your bookmarks and passwords when switching between all your devices.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">In the coming weeks we’re making changes to Chrome on iOS to help you get to your most important stuff right away. Instead of having to set up Chrome sync on your device, you can now simply sign in to Chrome to save new things in your Google Account and access what's already there. This may feel familiar to you, as it’s how many Google apps on iOS already work today. Once you’re signed in to Chrome, you’ll be able to save your important stuff to your account, including bookmarks, reading lists, passwords, payment info, addresses and settings. And, you can separately opt in to synchronizing your tabs and browsing history from Chrome on iOS to your Google Account, which can help you pick up browsing where you left off on another device.</span></p><div><span><br /></span></div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNYAg0TphT2UwYOyritbckc35lBCL21CBc-mPsCQdxoJVR3WUBijbZ5Bj7xq9TeO16qhBlQXJBsmm2gZw-agtWVN0UPGgBAYlbwTPP4SL5X71XO5FVKf0VkytaEnpz52Dwbm7oJvjWOGqRUR53qZzD87PPaHMJ8bqqfFpu-PJD4PibOpwtO79MFtMo1d-Q/s1624/SignIn%20(with%20gesture).gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1624\" data-original-width=\"750\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNYAg0TphT2UwYOyritbckc35lBCL21CBc-mPsCQdxoJVR3WUBijbZ5Bj7xq9TeO16qhBlQXJBsmm2gZw-agtWVN0UPGgBAYlbwTPP4SL5X71XO5FVKf0VkytaEnpz52Dwbm7oJvjWOGqRUR53qZzD87PPaHMJ8bqqfFpu-PJD4PibOpwtO79MFtMo1d-Q/w296-h640/SignIn%20(with%20gesture).gif\" width=\"296\" /></a></div><br /><span><br /></span></div><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">These updates are also designed to help you manage your data. When you sign in to Chrome, the browsing data that’s already on your device will be kept separate as local data on your device. You’ll be able to easily distinguish local from account data in settings. And, if you want any local data to be available on your other devices, you can simply go to settings and save it to your account.</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Signing in to Chrome on iOS remains entirely optional. If you don’t sign in, you can still save your bookmarks, passwords and more, but they will be available only on the device where you saved them. You can also continue to sign in to Google web services like Gmail without signing in to Chrome.</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">We’re hoping these changes make it even easier for you to get the best of Chrome while offering you all the flexibility you need.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\">Posted by Nico Jersch, Chrome Product Manager</span></span></p><br /></span>",

Since then, there has been a massive leap in web performance made possible by our work on Core Web Vitals (CWV) and its broader impact on the web. Today, over 40% of sites pass all of the CWV metrics, leading to pages that load and respond to interactions more quickly. Here’s a closer look at the journey to help improve the performance for sites and some specific work done in the browser and the ecosystem to enable this achievement.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Chrome's Quest for Speed</span></span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">The very essence of the web lies in its ability to provide information and services efficiently and rapidly. This principle is at the heart of Google's business and drives our work on Chrome. However, we noticed an issue with sites over a long time horizon.

Removing opportunities for confusion related to the terms “encrypted\" (a security property provided by TLS) and “safe\" (a subjective feeling) is one of the reasons why, beginning in Chrome 117, </span><a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2023/05/an-update-on-lock-icon.html\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span face=\"&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif\" style=\"color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Chrome replaced the lock icon</span></a><span face=\"&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif\" style=\"color: #0e101a; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"> in the address bar with a new security-neutral “tune” icon.</span></p><div><span><br /></span></div><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif\" style=\"font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">The Power of Automation</span></span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif\" style=\"color: #0e101a; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">As outlined above, server authentication certificates underpin the encrypted connections between web browsers and web servers.

We’re hopeful that as more CA owners support their customers in adopting automation, we’ll see continued developments such as these, making it even easier for website operators to securely obtain and manage server authentication certificates.</span></p><div><span><br /></span></div><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif\" style=\"font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-large;\">Learn More</span></span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">If you’re a website operator, we encourage you to discover the potential of automated certificate issuance and management, and you should get started today!

We now have extensions that unlock uncharted levels of productivity for developers or harness the power of generative AI to reshape work as we know it.
