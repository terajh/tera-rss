He explains how to structure \"stream-aligned\" teams and use a \"tiger team\" for foundational architecture. He also discusses the sociotechnical benefits of reducing external dependencies and shares how to use guardrails and discovery services to achieve 25+ deployments per day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;By Luca Mezzalira&lt;/i&gt;",
