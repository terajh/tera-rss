    "partialText": "<p><em>TL;DR: Access to Frontend Dogma’s main feed now requires a <a href=\"https://j9t.gumroad.com/l/fd\">small maintenance fee of $12 per year</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Over the years, Frontend Dogma has become one of the main sources of frontend development news and tools. <a href=\"https://frontenddogma.com/topics/\">Frontend Dogma’s growing archives</a> provide <a href=\"https://meiert.com/blog/identify-your-unknown-unknowns/\">unique</a> access to the history of the wider field of web development.</p>\n<p>Providing this service for free is not sustainable, however. <a href=\"https://frontenddogma.com/books/\">Book sales</a> pay for some of the work, but so far, few people acknowledge Frontend Dogma’s value by supporting the project <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/frontenddogma\">on Open Collective</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Starting today, the global RSS feed (with the 250 newest articles and videos) is a paid feature.</em></p>\n<p>You can get access by a <a href=\"https://j9t.gumroad.com/l/fd\">small maintenance contribution of only $12 per year</a>.</p>\n<p>If you <em>don’t</em> like to support Frontend Dogma, you can still follow Frontend Dogma’s <a href=\"https://frontenddogma.com/posts/2024/follow-your-favorite-web-dev-topics-with-topic-feeds/\">individual topic feeds</a> as well as Frontend Dogma’s social media accounts <a href=\"https://mas.to/@frontenddogma\">on Mastodon</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/frontenddogma.com\">Bluesky</a>. These are less convenient and reliable but still workable options to stay up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Also, if you want to support Frontend Dogma in a different manner and so that the main feed may be made free again, consider buying <a href=\"https://frontenddogma.com/books/\">Frontend Dogma’s books</a> or contributing to the project <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/frontenddogma\">on Open Collective</a>. You’re not alone: We do the same for the projects we use and like. Thank you.</p>",
