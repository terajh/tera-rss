    "partialText": "&lt;img src=\"https://res.infoq.com/news/2026/02/chrome-temporal-date-api/en/headerimage/generatedHeaderImage-1771183481391.jpg\"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome 144 introduces the groundbreaking Temporal API, revolutionizing date and time management in JavaScript. As a modern alternative to the criticized Date object, Temporal resolves parsing ambiguities, time zone complexities, and mutable arithmetic. With distinct types and built-in support, it empowers developers to handle dates seamlessly, though adoption varies across browsers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;By Daniel Curtis&lt;/i&gt;",
