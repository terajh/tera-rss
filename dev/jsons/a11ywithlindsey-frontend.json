I still don't feel like I know a lot of things. There's a lot that still confuses me. But I've grown a lot in my knowledge in the past year and a half. I wanted to share what I've learned. My goal is to get more accessibility folks into the JavaScript community. The cryptic vocabulary for JavaScript concepts is intimidating for many folks (including myself). It’s why I didn’t become a JavaScript developer until I was 4.5 years into my career. Many experts say you should know the fundamentals well before learning frameworks. But where is that boundary?

I found there to be a tremendous opportunity to educate communities and help to others learn. In Rian’s blog post, a few things stuck out to me as main problems (these are directly from her site): \"The codebase of Gutenberg is difficult for all of us, because no one in the wpa11y team is a skilled React developer.

I very much loved working on automation especially when it was incorporated into our Continuous Integration. This would fail builds that introduced accessibility errors, which was a great way to ensure that we were thinking about accessibility from the start and not adding new problems. However, I feel like we like to automate our problems away and it cannot fix everything for you. Automated accessibility testing catches those nitpicky HTML errors so that you can focus on the more significant and subjective items manually. Accessibility is empathy-driven, and you can not automate empathy. Automation certainly makes a lot of things easier, like…",

But when developers who are still newer to accessibility are trying to convince their bosses, sometimes they clap back that “this is a low priority” or “that is an edge case.” Oh goodness, nothing gets my blood boiling more when someone dismisses the needs of their users.
