    "title": "The Morrigan by Kim Curran",
    "partialText": "<p>Every culture has its myths and legends. Greece has its gods and warriors. England has its stories of Arthur. Ireland has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann\">Tuatha Dé Danann</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Cycle\">The Ulster Cycle</a>, and more.</p>\n\n<p>But while the Arthurian legends and the Greek myths have been retold many times, the stories of ancient Ireland have remained largely untouched.</p>\n\n<p>Kim Curran’s book <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781405969376\"><cite>The Morrigan</cite></a> takes on this challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The blurb for the book compares it <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781408890042\">Madeline Miller’s <cite>Circe</cite></a>, which is a bold comparison. The writing in <cite>The Morrigan</cite> isn’t in the same league as <cite>Circe</cite>, but then again, very little is.</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, the comparison makes complete sense.</p>\n\n<p><cite>Circe</cite> starts with the titular nymph in the world of the gods of Olympus before moving on to more mortal affairs, coming to a head with the events of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey\"><cite>The Odyssey</cite></a>, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus\">Odysseus</a>’s story dominates.</p>\n\n<p><cite>The Morrigan</cite> starts with the titular goddess in the world of the gods of the Túatha Dé before moving on to more mortal affairs, coming to a head with the events of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A1in_B%C3%B3_C%C3%BAailnge\"><cite>The Táin</cite></a>, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%BA_Chulainn\">Cú Chulainn</a>’s story dominates.</p>\n\n<p>I took me a little while to adjust to the tone, but once I did, I thoroughly enjoyed this retelling. It manages to simultaneously capture the bloody, over-the-top feeling of <cite>The Táin</cite> while also having a distinctly modern twist. By the last third, I was completely engrossed.</p>\n\n<p>After finishing <cite>Circe</cite> I went on a spree of reading <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/lists/greek-myths\">many, many modern retellings of Greek myths</a>. Now that I’ve finished <cite>The Morrigan</cite> I want to do the same for the Irish legends.</p>\n\n<p>But I can’t. Apart from re-reading a translation of <cite>The Táin</cite>, there’s not much else out there for me.</p>\n\n<p>Kim Curran does have another book that’s just been released; <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780241713051\"><cite>Brigid</cite></a> (the goddess? the saint? both?). If it’s anything like <cite>The Morrigan</cite>, it’s going to be a must-read.</p>\n\n<p>I hope these books are the first of many.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781405969376\"><img src=\"https://images-eu.bookshop.org/product-images/images/9781405969376.jpg\" width=\"326\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Buy this book\"></a></p>",

    "title": "Concertina",
    "partialText": "<p>I watched a good film last night. <a href=\"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_(2025_film)\"><cite>Tornado</cite></a> from the same writer and director of the also-excellent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_West\"><cite>Slow West</cite></a>.</p>\n\n<p><cite>Tornado</cite> is a Scottish Samurai Western set in the 1790s. Although it’s not likely that many Samurai would’ve been in Scotland during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku\">the sakoku period</a>, I was willingly able to suspend my disbelief …until something quite minor happened on screen.</p>\n\n<p>One of the characters is seen playing a concertina. “Hang on”, I thought, “1790s? That’s not right!”</p>\n\n<p>And indeed, once the film was over I reached for my laptop and confirmed that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concertina\">the concertina</a> is very much a 19th century invention.</p>\n\n<p>Look, it’s not that I know when most musical instruments were invented, but I happened to know about the concertina’s origin because of a different technology.</p>\n\n<p>See, the concertina was invented by one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone\">Charles Wheatsone</a>. He invented quite a few things. He, along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fothergill_Cooke\">William Cooke</a>, more or less created the electric telegraph, around the same time as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse\">Samuel Morse</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I only know this because of the excellent book by <a href=\"https://tomstandage.wordpress.com/\">Tom Standage</a> called <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780753807033\"><cite>The Victorian Internet</cite></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The remarkable story of the telegraph and the nineteenth century’s online pioneers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prompted by that book, I found out more about Wheatstone, including the fact that he invented the concertina. So that’s why I found myself slightly taken out of the action when watching that film last night. In the 1790s, nobody was playing the concertina in Scotland or anywhere else.</p>\n\n<p>Today, though, the concertina is thriving, especially in Ireland. It’s particularly popular in County Clare. Though, as I’m writing this, I’m listening to the playing of a Kerryman, <a href=\"https://www.cormacbegley.com/\">Cormac Begley</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll be seeing him play tonight in the Brighton Dome where he’ll be providing the music for the superb Teaċ Damhsa production, <a href=\"https://teacdamsa.com/production/mam/\">MÁM</a>. This’ll be <a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/19684\">my second time experiencing it</a>. <i land=\"ie\">Táim ar bís!</i></p>",

    "title": "Daughters of Sparta by Claire Heywood",
    "partialText": "<p>Towards the end of 2025, <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22317\">I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think I might change things up in 2026. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to write all the little reviews at once, I think I should write a review as soon as I finish a book. Instead of holding onto my reckons for months, I can just set them free one at a time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ll get the ball rolling with the first book I read in 2026.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve mentioned before that one interesting lens to apply to modern retellings of the Greek myths is how they treat deities. Are gods and goddesses real in this story? Or is it a non-interventionist tale with a purely human cast? In her book The Shadow Of Perseus, Claire Heywood wrote about Perseus, Medusa, and Andromeda without any supernatural characters. Having been impressed by that, I figured I’d go back to investigate her debut, <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529333695\">Daughters Of Sparta</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The framing device is one I hadn’t come across before. It follows the diverging stories of sisters Helen and Clytemnestra, flipping back and forth between the two throughout their lives. I’ve read plenty of takes on the Trojan war, and I’ve read plenty of takes on Clytemnestra’s revenge, but I think this is the first time they’ve been combined like this.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it works. There are inevitable time jumps. Some time periods are bound to get more attention than others. And at some point, the narrative just has to wrap up, even though we know there’s pleny more that follows afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, a good addition to the list of <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/lists/greek-myths\">modern retellings of classical Greek stories</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529333695\"><img src=\"https://images-eu.bookshop.org/product-images/images/9781529333695.jpg\" width=\"326\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Buy this book\"></a></p>",

    "title": "Trad travels",
    "partialText": "<p>For the past few years, I’ve been <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22166\">taking a trip to Spain</a> at the end of September for the <a href=\"https://www.irishfleadh.com/\">Cáceres Irish Fleadh</a>. Last year I convinced my friends Liam and Monica to come along and they had a great time.</p>\n\n<p>Like me, Liam just loves playing in sessions. Also like me, Liam likes to spend the gloomy short days of January thinking about travelling somewhere …and then playing in sessions there.</p>\n\n<p>I told him I’d put together a list of potential trips for the discerning session hound. I figured I might as well share it here too…</p>\n\n<p>First of all, there are Irish music festivals. Alas, most festivals don’t happen in the sunny climes of Spain. As you’d expect, most of them are in Ireland.</p>\n\n<p>I’m heading to Carlingford at the end of this month for a weekend of <a href=\"https://www.feilenatana.com/\">Féile na Tána</a>. I haven’t been before but it looks good. There’ll be the usual amalgam of workshops, concerts, and sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Myself and <a href=\"https://wordridden.com/\">Jessica</a> will fly in to Belfast, then take the train down to Newry and get to Carlingford from there. You could fly into Dublin and get the train up to Dundalk, but the only Gatwick flights to Dublin are Ryan Air, and I’d rather entrust my instrument to EasyJet.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of March we’re heading to <a href=\"https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/\">Tullamore Trad Fest</a>. That’s another one we haven’t been to before. Again, there’ll be workshops, concerts, and sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Tullamore is just an hour away from Dublin by train and has plenty of accommodation options. We’ve booked into <a href=\"https://www.seadewhouse.com/\">a nice-looking B&amp;B</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no avoiding Ryan Air for this trip and I want to take my good mandolin, so I’ve gone ahead and <a href=\"https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/articles/12889013645713-What-music-equipment-can-I-bring-on-board\">booked a separate seat</a> for it. I don’t want to take any chances with an airline that actively seeks to elevate misery.</p>\n\n<p>The festival I heartily recommend is <a href=\"https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/\">Belfast Trad Fest</a> at the end of July. It’s super convenient to get to with EasyJet flights from Gatwick—go to Belfast <em>city</em> airport, which is right downtown.</p>\n\n<p>The festival offers a really good accommodation deal in modern student flats. The workshops are top-notch, and best of all, it has a really well-organised session trail. You can easily play in sessions all afternoon and evening.</p>\n\n<p>This year, for the first time ever, Belfast trad fest is immediately followed by <a href=\"https://fleadhcheoil.ie/\">the all-Ireland fleadh</a>, which promises to be pandemonium. I’ve never been to the fleadh before but I’m going to stick around Belfast for it.</p>\n\n<p>You could head to the <a href=\"https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/\">Willie Clancy Festival</a> in Miltown Malbay at the start of July (the website seems to be having some issues right now). But good luck finding accommodation. The event is so big now that unless you’re camping, there’s not much chance of finding a place to stay. If you make it there though, non-stop sessions await. Non-stop chaos awaits too. That’s part of the deal. Great workshops though!</p>\n\n<p>There are other festivals I haven’t been to but I’ve heard great things about. <a href=\"https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/\">The Pádraig O’Keeffe Festival</a> in Kerry in October sounds fantastic, especially if you like your polkas and slides. But it’s in Castleisland, which doesn’t have much in the way of accommodation. So unless you’ve got transport, it’s going to be tricky.</p>\n\n<p>There’s <a href=\"https://kilkennytradfest.com/\">a trad fest in Kilkenny in March</a>. I’ve never been but they’ve got a session trail. You’d need to fly into either Dublin or Cork and then get on a bus. Either way, it’s Ryan Air from Gatwick.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also never been to the <a href=\"https://ennistradfest.com/\">Ennis Trad Fest</a> in county Clare in November but I’ve heard good things. Accommodation for the 2026 event is already in short supply though.</p>\n\n<p>But you don’t need a festival to play in sessions. In fact, the kind of sessions you end up in at festivals have a different vibe to the usual sessions, simply because they’re formed of a hodge-podge of visiting players.</p>\n\n<p>There a few spots in Ireland where you’re guaranteed a session pretty much any night of the week.</p>\n\n<p>I love Galway. There are afternoon sessions in Taafe’s and Tigh Cóilí as well as evening sessions in the Crane and other places. You’d need to fly into Dublin and get the train from there. It takes about two hours.</p>\n\n<p>Galway is busy in the summer time and accommodation can be pricy, but if you go off-season you can find some cheaper options.</p>\n\n<p>Ennis has <a href=\"https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland\">music most nights</a>. There’s a regular bus service between Ennis and Shannon airport that’s nice and quick. You’d need to fly Ryan Air from Gatwick though.</p>\n\n<p>And then there’s Belfast again. Even when the trad fest isn’t happening, Belfast has sessions seven nights a week. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/belfastsessionguide/\">Belfast session guide Instagram account</a> for up-to-date details.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend staying in <a href=\"https://www.theflintbelfast.com/\">The Flint</a>, but make sure you ask for a room on the top floor far away from the nightclub if you’re there on a weekend.</p>\n\n<p>So, to recap, here are some festivals to check out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.feilenatana.com/\">Féile na Tána</a> in Carlingford, county Louth in January (I’m going),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/\">Tullamore Trad Fest</a> in county  Offaly in March (I’m going),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kilkennytradfest.com/\">Kilkenny Trad Fest</a> also in March,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/\">Scoil Samhraidh Willie Clancy</a> in Miltown Malbay, county Clare in July,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/\">Belfast Trad Fest</a> at the end of July (I’m going),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fleadhcheoil.ie/\">Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann</a> also in Belfast at the start of August (I’m going),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.irishfleadh.com/\">Cáceres Irish Fleadh</a> in Spain in September (I’m going),</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/\">The Pádraig O’Keeffe festival</a> in Castleisland, county Kerry in October, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ennistradfest.com/\">Ennis Trad Fest</a> in county Clare in November.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And then for year-round session action, you can visit:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Galway,+Ireland\">Galway</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland\">Ennis</a>, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Belfast,+Antrim,+Northern%20Ireland\">Belfast</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "partialText": "<p>Toward the end of 2021, I wrote about <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/18620\">working a four-day week</a>. It really suited me. So much so that I’ve gone one further. For the past year or so I’ve been working a three-day week.</p>\n\n<p>I work on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. From Friday to Monday, my days are my own.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>really</em> changes the dynamic of the week. It no longer feels like an extended weekend. What I mean is that usually we think about the working week as the default and the weekend as the exception. That’s been flipped on its head for me. The three days I spend working feel like the exception.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, this decision meant earning less money. But I’ve decided that I value time more than money. I know that’s a privileged position to be in. Many people have to expend all their time in order to make just enough money.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve made some choices along the way that certainly help. I don’t have children. I don’t have a car. I live in a modest flat and I’ve paid off the mortgage. I live in a country where healthcare is free.</p>\n\n<p>So I don’t have too many expenses. My biggest expenses are travel-related; getting to the States to see family, or travelling to Irish music festivals wherever they may be.</p>\n\n<p>But still, working a three-day week means I can make enough to cover my expenses and still put some money aside for the future.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this wouldn’t work for everyone. My work tends to be the kind that doesn’t require much direct collaboration (which is also why I mostly work from home). I imagine it could get frustrating being on a team of people working different numbers of days.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also really lucky to have the choice to do this. I know that many workplaces wouldn’t allow this kind of lifestyle. <a href=\"https://clearleft.com/\">Clearleft</a> is different.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://adactio.com/articles/21110\">my last conference talk</a>, I touched on this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think you could you could divide management into two categories like you can do with programming languages. There is a very imperative school of management where it’s all about measurements, it’s all about those performance reports, it’s all about metrics, time tracking. Maybe they install software on your machine to track how long you’ve been working. It’s all about measuring those outputs.</p>\n\n  <p>That’s one approach to management. Then there’s a more declarative approach, where you just care about the work getting done and you don’t care how people do it. So if they want to work from home, let them work from home. If they want to work strange hours, let them work strange hours. What do you care as long as the work gets done? This is more about giving people autonomy and trust.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m very happy that Clearleft takes the declarative approach.</p>\n\n<p>And I can reiterate <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/18620\">what I said when I stopped working on Fridays</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I haven’t experienced any reduction in productivity. Quite the opposite. There may be a corollary to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law\">Parkinson’s Law</a>: work contracts to fill the time available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now that I don’t work on Mondays, bank holiday weekends don’t mean much to me anymore. Or to put it another way, every weekend is like a bank holiday weekend. If I want to travel somewhere on a Friday and come back on a Monday, I don’t need to book any time off. That’s really nice.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve got four days in a row to do with as I wish. I had to fight the urge to immediately launch into some new project or side-hustle to fill the time. I’m savouring it instead.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve got time to take care of <a href=\"https://thesession.org/\">The Session</a>. I’ve got time to read. I’ve got time to cook. I’ve got time to spend learning Irish. Mostly I’ve got time to just <em>be</em>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>Here’s the new year, same as the old year. Well, not the same, but pretty similar.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/21630\">At the end of 2024</a>, I wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was a year dominated by Ukraine and Gaza. Utterly horrific and unnecessary death courtesy of Putin and Netanyahu</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See what I mean?</p>\n\n<p>2025 added an extra dose of American carnage with Trump’s psychotic combination of cruelty and incompetence directed at the very foundations of the country. I’ve got to be honest, I’m tired of the USA living rent-free in my head so I’ve issued an eviction notice. It’s not that I don’t have sympathy and empathy for what’s happening there, but a majority of the country voted for this …again. Like a dog voting to have its nose rubbed in its own shit. Maybe this time the lesson will stick.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, leaving world events aside (yes, please!), I also said this at the end of last year:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For me personally, 2024 was just fine. I was relatively healthy all year. The people I love were relatively healthy too. I don’t take that for granted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, same. No major health issues in 2025. My loved ones are well. My gratitude grows.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve already written about <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22324\">how much music I played in 2025</a>. I’m hoping to continue that trajectory in 2026 with lots of sessions. We’re four days into the year and I’ve already had two excellent sessions. There are another three lined up this week.</p>\n\n<p>One of the highlights of 2025 was <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22026\">my trip with Jessica to Donegal</a>. Learning Irish by day, playing in sessions by night, all while surrounded by gorgeous scenery. I’ve already got a return trip planned for 2026. I’m also planning to be back in Belfast for the annual <a href=\"https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/\">tradfest</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Other 2025 highlights include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/21971\">Curating an excellent edition of UX London</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/21680\">Releasing the new Salter Cane album</a> and <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/21975\">playing those songs live</a>—I want to do more of that in 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Most of <a href=\"https://adactio.com/archive/2025/map\">my travel in 2025</a> was either for music or family.</p>\n\n<p>I made three trips to the States to see the in-laws: California, Florida, and most recently, Arizona. I can’t say I feel very comfortable going to the States right now, especially to Florida, where people openly display their intolerance on their T-shirts, and Arizona where they openly display their guns.</p>\n\n<p>I went back to my hometown of Cobh a few times during the year to visit my mother.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from those family trips, I went to Belfast, Donegal, Galway, and Clare in Ireland, Cáceres in Spain, Namur in Belgium, and Amsterdam. Only that last one was work-related. I always make sure to get to CSS Day.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile here on my website, <a href=\"https://adactio.com/archive/2025\">I posted 695 times in 2025</a>. That includes <a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/archive/2025\">345 notes</a>, <a href=\"https://adactio.com/links/archive/2025\">262 links</a>, and <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/archive/2025\">86 blog posts</a>. Here are some I’m quite fond of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/21728\">The web on mobile</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22034\">Portugeating</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22084\">Style your underlines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22155\">Hounds Of Love</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22183\">Research</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22228\">Bóthar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22265\">Why use React?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/22304\">Tunes and typefaces</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All in all, 2025 was a grand year for me. It wasn’t all that different from the year before. I’m at an age where the years aren’t all that differentiated from one another. I’m okay with that because I’m also at an age where I know what brings me joy and satisfaction, and I can focus on those things.</p>\n\n<p>So here’s to 2026, which I hope I will spend doing more of what I did in 2025: playing music, speaking Irish, eating good food, hanging out with friends, reading good books, travelling to interesting places, and staying relatively healthy.</p>\n\n<div style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr);\">\n<a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/22275\"><img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://adactio.com/images/uploaded/22275/medium.jpg\" alt=\"I’m sitting playing my lovely red mandolin and smiling at the camera.\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/22061\"><img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://adactio.com/images/uploaded/22061/medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mé seanding on the street pointing over my shoulder at a red brick building behind me.\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/21953\"><img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://adactio.com/images/uploaded/21953/medium.jpg\" alt=\"A selfie in an auditorium with big screens displaying the Clearleft logo.\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/21844\"><img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://adactio.com/images/uploaded/21844/medium.jpg\" alt=\"Myself and Jessica dressed in black with our instruments in our backs taking a selfie in a bus shelter.\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/21992#photo1\"><img id=\"photo1\" class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://adactio.com/images/uploaded/21992-1/medium.jpg\" alt=\"A selfie with Jessica with green grass and a sandy beach in the background under a blue sky with a few clouds.\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://adactio.com/notes/21699#photo2\"><img id=\"photo2\" class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://adactio.com/images/uploaded/21699-2/medium.jpg\" alt=\"A selfie of me wearing a blue shirt and blue hoodie on a sandy beach next to the ocean under a sky that is half clear and half cloudy.\"></a>\n</div>",
