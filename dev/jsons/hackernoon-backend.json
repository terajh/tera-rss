    "partialText": "Java abstracts away manual memory management, but the JVM still operates on a precise memory model. Local variables and method frames live on the stack, while actual objects live on the heap, which is divided into generations to make garbage collection efficient. Different reference types (strong, soft, weak, phantom) influence GC behavior, especially for caches and off-heap resources.\n\nGarbage Collection uses variations of mark-and-sweep to identify reachable objects and reclaim memory from the rest, sometimes compacting to avoid fragmentation. GC pauses are real and can impact latency, which is why selecting the right collector matters (G1, Parallel, ZGC, Shenandoah, etc.) and why JVM tuning exists.\n\nUnderstanding how memory works under the hood enables developers to diagnose leaks, reduce allocation pressure, tune pause times, and configure the JVM for different workloads — turning memory management from a black box into a performance tool.<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss\">Read All</a></p>",
