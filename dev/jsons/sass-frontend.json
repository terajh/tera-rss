    "partialText": "<p>For users of the indented syntax (<code>.sass</code>), there has been a long standing\nrequest for the ability to have line breaks that don't end a statement. Certain\nCSS syntaxes like <code>grid-template</code> and <code>@font-face</code> <code>src</code> declarations are long,\nand line breaks can greatly increase the readability of the styles.</p>\n<p>There have been many suggestions, several attempts, and numerous workarounds to\naddress this pain point. We are proposing several new syntax options in the\nindented syntax that add considerable flexibility and look to address this as\npart of the language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multiline-statements\" tabindex=\"-1\">Multiline statements<a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/rfc-indented-syntax/#multiline-statements\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">Multiline statements permalink</span></a></h2>\n<p>We propose allowing statements in the indented syntax to span multiple lines, as\nlong as line breaks occur in places where the statement can't end.</p>\n<p>A common way of using this syntax will be wrapping lists with line breaks in\nparentheses. This allows for a grid-template declaration on multiple lines.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sass\"><code class=\"language-sass\"><span class=\"token selector\">.grid</span>\n<span class=\"token property-line\">  <span class=\"token property\">display</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> grid</span>\n<span class=\"token property-line\">  <span class=\"token property\">grid-template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> (</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"header\"</span> min-content\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"main\"</span> 1fr\n  <span class=\"token selector\">)</span></code></pre>\n<p>As usual, these parentheses will not be included in the output.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.grid</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">display</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> grid<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">grid-template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"header\"</span> min-content <span class=\"token string\">\"main\"</span> 1fr<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Powering this change is the underlying rule that linebreaks only end statements\nwhere it's valid for a statement to end. Anywhere where a statement can't end, a\nlinebreak is ignored. This means that if the parser can't tell whether or not a\nlinebreak is intended to end a statement, it will end the statement.</p>\n<p>This example demonstrates several places where line breaks will not end\nstatements.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-sass\"><code class=\"language-sass\"><span class=\"token atrule-line\"><span class=\"token atrule\">@each</span> $item in /* A statement can't end after the word \"in\" in an `<span class=\"token atrule\">@each</span>` statement. */</span>\n    <span class=\"token selector\">1, 2, 3</span>\n  <span class=\"token selector\">.item-#{ </span>\n<span class=\"token variable-line\">    <span class=\"token variable\">$item</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">*</span> A statement can't end inside the curly braces in an interpolation. <span class=\"token operator\">*</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span></span>\n  <span class=\"token selector\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token property-line\">    <span class=\"token property\">content</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token variable\">$item</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">*</span> A statement can't end after a multiplication operator. <span class=\"token operator\">*</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span></span>\n        <span class=\"token selector\">10</span></code></pre>\n<p>As a counter example, here are some places in the same stylesheet where\nlinebreaks could end statements.

    "title": "Sass color spaces & wide gamut colors",
    "partialText": "<p>Wide gamut colors are coming to Sass!</p>\n<p>I should clarify. Wide gamut CSS color formats like <code>oklch(…)</code> and <code>color(display-p3 …)</code> have been available in all major browsers since May, 2023. But even before that, these new color formats were <em>allowed</em> in Sass. This is one of my favorite features of Sass: most new CSS <em>just works</em>, without any need for &quot;official&quot; support or updates. When Sass encounters unknown CSS, it passes that code along to the browser. Not everything needs to be pre-processed.</p>\n<p>Often, that's all we need. When Cascade Layers and Container Queries rolled out in browsers, there was nothing more for Sass to do. But the new CSS color formats are a bit different. Since colors are a first-class data type in Sass, we don't always want to pass them along <em>as-is</em>. We often want to manipulate and manage colors before they go to the browser.</p>\n<p>Already know all about color spaces? <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#css-color-functions-in-sass\">Skip ahead to the new Sass features</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-color-format-trade-off\" tabindex=\"-1\">The color format trade-off<a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#the-color-format-trade-off\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">The color format trade-off permalink</span></a></h2>\n<p>CSS has historically been limited to <code>sRGB</code> color formats, which share two main features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They use an underlying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model\">RGB color model</a> for representing &amp; manipulating colors mathematically by controlling the relative amounts of <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, and <code>blue</code> light.</li>\n<li>They can only represent colors in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB\"><code>sRGB</code> color gamut</a> -- the default range of color that can be displayed on color monitors since the mid 1990s.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"clear-gamut-boundaries\" tabindex=\"-1\">Clear gamut boundaries<a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#clear-gamut-boundaries\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">Clear gamut boundaries permalink</span></a></h3>\n<p>The previously available formats in CSS -- named colors (e.g. <code>red</code>), <code>hex</code> colors (e.g. <code>#f00</code>), and color functions (e.g. <code>rgb()</code>/<code>rgba()</code>, <code>hsl()</code>/<code>hsla()</code>, and more recently <code>hwb()</code>) -- are all ways of describing <code>sRGB</code> colors. Named colors are special, but the other formats use a 'coordinate' system, as though the colors of the gamut were projected into 3d space:</p>\n<figure>\n<div style=\"display: grid; gap: var(--sl-gutter--quarter); grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\">\n<img src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/blog/042-srgb.png\" alt=\"sRGB gamut rendered in sRGB space forms a rainbow colored cube\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n<img src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/blog/042-srgb-hsl.png\" alt=\"sRGB gamut rendered in hsl space forms a rainbow-edged cylinder with black at the bottom and white at the top\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n<img src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/blog/042-srgb-hwb.png\" alt=\"sRGB gamut rendered in hwb space forms a rainbow-core top surface with a black-to-gray bottom and gray-to-white outside edge\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n</div>\n<figcaption>\nImages generated using\n<a href=\"https://facelessuser.github.io/coloraide/demos\">ColorAide</a>\nby Isaac Muse.\n</figcaption>\n<figure>\n<p>Look at those nice, geometric shapes! RGB gives us a rainbow cube, while HSL and HWB (with their &quot;polar&quot; <code>hue</code> channels) arrange those same colors into cylinders. The clean boundaries make it easy for us to know (mathematically) what colors are <em>in gamut</em> or <em>out of gamut</em>. In <code>rgb()</code> we use values of <code>0-255</code>. Anything inside that range will be inside the cube, but if a channel goes below <code>0</code> or above <code>255</code>, we're no longer inside the <code>sRGB</code> gamut. In <code>hsl()</code> and <code>hwb()</code> the <code>hue</code> coordinates can keep going around the circle without ever reaching escape velocity, but the <code>saturation</code>, <code>lightness</code>, <code>whiteness</code>, and <code>blackness</code> channels go cleanly from <code>0-1</code> or <code>0%-100%</code>. Again, anything outside that range is outside the color space.</p>\n<h3 id=\"matching-human-perception\" tabindex=\"-1\">Matching human perception<a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#matching-human-perception\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">Matching human perception permalink</span></a></h3>\n<p>But that simplicity comes with limitations. The most obvious is that monitors keep getting better. These days, many monitors can display colors beyond <code>sRGB</code>, especially extending the range of bright greens available. If we simply extend our shapes with the new colors available, we're no longer dealing with clean geometry!</p>\n<div style=\"display: grid; gap: var(--sl-gutter--quarter); grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\">\n<img src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/blog/042-p3-srgb.png\" alt=\"display-p3 gamut rendered in sRGB space adds unequal red and green horns to the sRGB cube\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n<img src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/blog/042-p3-hsl.png\" alt=\"display-p3 gamut rendered in hsl space creates a boot-like bulge of green near the base of the hsl cylinder\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n</div>\n<p>The crisp edges and clean math of <code>sRGB</code> formats were only possible because we knew exactly what colors could be displayed, and we arranged those colors to fit perfectly into a box. But human color perception is not so clear-cut, and it doesn't align perfectly with the gamut of any monitors on the market. When we attempt to space all the same colors <em>evenly</em> based on human perception rather than simple math, we get an entirely different shape with swooping edges. This is the <code>display-p3</code> gamut in <code>oklch</code> space:</p>\n<img src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/blog/042-p3-oklch.png\" alt=\"display-p3 gamut rendered in oklch space forms a skewed cube with a conic black base\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n<p>The practical difference is particularly noticeable when we compare colors of the same 'lightness' in <code>hsl</code> vs <code>oklch</code>. Humans perceive yellow hues as lighter than blues. By scaling them to fit in the same range, <code>hsl</code> gives us a yellow that is much brighter than the blue:</p>\n<img src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/blog/042-blue-yellow.jpg\" alt=\"on the left a blue and much brighter yellow, on the right our yellow is much darker to match the blue tone\" width=\"753\" height=\"209\">\n<h2 id=\"new-css-formats-give-us-the-choice\" tabindex=\"-1\">New CSS formats give us the choice<a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#new-css-formats-give-us-the-choice\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">New CSS formats give us the choice permalink</span></a></h2>\n<p>Moving forward, there are two directions we could go with wide gamut colors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Color formats that re-fit larger and larger gamuts into simple coordinates, stretching the colors to preserve clean, geometric boundaries.</li>\n<li>Color formats that maintain their <em>perceptually uniform</em> spacing, without any regard for specific gamuts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the one hand, clean boundaries allow us to easily stay inside the range of available colors. Without those boundaries, it would be easy to <em>accidentally</em> request colors that aren't even physically possible. On the other hand, we expect these colors to be <em>perceived</em> by <em>other humans</em> -- and we need to make things <em>look</em> consistent, with enough contrast to be readable.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/\">CSS Color Module Level 4</a> defines a number of new CSS color formats. Some of them maintain geometric access to specific color spaces. Like the more familiar <code>rgb()</code> and <code>hsl()</code> functions, the newer <code>hwb()</code> function still describes colors in the <code>sRGB</code> gamut, using <code>hue</code>, <code>whiteness</code>, and <code>blackness</code> channels.  It's an interesting format, and <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/29/hwb-clamping/\">I've written about it before</a>.</p>\n<p>The rest of the gamut-bounded spaces are available using the <code>color(&lt;space&gt; &lt;3-channels&gt; / &lt;alpha&gt;)</code> function. Using that syntax we can define colors in <code>sRGB</code>, <code>srbg-linear</code>, <code>display-p3</code> (common for modern monitors), <code>a98-rgb</code>, <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, and <code>rec2020</code>. Each of these maps the specified gamut onto a range of (cubic) coordinates from <code>0-1</code> or <code>0%-100%</code>. Nice and clean.</p>\n<p>In the same <code>color()</code> function, we can also access the 'device independent' (and gamut-less) <code>xyz</code> color spaces -- often used as an international baseline for converting between different color models. I won't get into <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#white-point\">white points</a> here, but we can specify <code>xyz-d65</code> (the default) explicitly, or use <code>xyz-d50</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Working outwards from <code>xyz</code>, we get a number of new <em>theoretically unbounded</em> color formats -- prioritizing <em>perceptually uniform</em> distribution over clean geometry. These are available in functions of their own, including <code>lab()</code> (<code>lightness</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>b</code>) and <code>lch()</code> (<code>lightness</code>, <code>chroma</code>, and <code>hue</code>) along with the newer 'ok' versions of each -- <code>oklab()</code> and <code>oklch()</code>. If you want the full history of these formats, <a href=\"https://ericportis.com/posts/2024/okay-color-spaces/\">Eric Portis has written a great explainer</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tl-dr-top-priority-new-formats\" tabindex=\"-1\">TL;DR top priority new formats<a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#tl-dr-top-priority-new-formats\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">TL;DR top priority new formats permalink</span></a></h2>\n<p>For the color experts, it's great to have all this flexibility. For the rest of us, there are a few stand-out formats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>color(display-p3 …)</code> provides access to a wider gamut of colors, which are available on many modern displays, while maintaining a clear set of gamut boundaries.</li>\n<li><code>oklch(…)</code> is the most intuitive and perceptually uniform space to work in, a newer alternative to <code>hsl(…)</code> -- <code>chroma</code> is very similar to <code>saturation</code>. But there are few guard rails here, and it's easy to end up outside the gamuts that any screen can possibly display. The coordinate system is still describing a cylinder, but the edges of human perception and display technology don't map neatly into that space.</li>\n<li>For transitions and gradients, if we want to go directly between hues (instead of going around the color wheel), <code>oklab(…)</code> is a good linear option. Usually, a transition or gradient between two in-gamut colors will stay in gamut -- but we can't always rely on that when we're dealing with extremes of saturation or lightness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"css-color-functions-in-sass\" tabindex=\"-1\">CSS color functions in Sass<a class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#css-color-functions-in-sass\"><span class=\"visuallyhidden\">CSS color functions in Sass permalink</span></a></h2>\n<p>Sass now accepts all the new CSS formats, and treats them as first-class <em>colors</em> that we can manipulate, mix, convert, and inspect.

When all the color formats describe the same color gamut using the same underlying model, you can provide a color using <code>hsl()</code> syntax, and the parser can eagerly convert it to <code>rgb()</code> without risking any data loss. That's no longer the case for modern color spaces.</p>\n<p>In general, any color defined in a given space will remain in that space, and be emitted in that space. The space is defined by the function used, either one of the named spaced passed to <code>color()</code>, or the function name (e.g. <code>lab</code> for colors defined using the <code>lab()</code> function).</p>\n<p>However, the <code>rgb</code>, <code>hsl</code>, and <code>hwb</code> spaces are considered &quot;legacy spaces&quot;, and often get special handling for the sake of backwards compatibility. Legacy colors are still emitted in the most backwards-compatible format available. This matches CSS’s own backwards-compatibility behavior. Colors defined using hex notation or CSS color names are also considered part of the legacy <code>rgb</code> color space.</p>\n<p>Sass provides a variety of tools for inspecting and working with these color spaces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can inspect the space of a color using <code>color.space($color)</code></li>\n<li>We can ask if the color is in a legacy space with <code>color.is-legacy($color)</code></li>\n<li>We can <em>convert</em> a color from one space to another using <code>color.to-space($color, $space)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these functions are

Sass allows us to ask if a channel is powerless using the <code>color.is-powerless()</code> function:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example ui-tabs\">\n  <ul class=\"ui-tabs-nav ui-helper-reset ui-helper-clearfix\"><li class=\"ui-tabs-tab ui-tabs-active\">\n  <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#example-color-fns-scss\" class=\"ui-tabs-anchor\">SCSS</a>\n</li>\n<li class=\"ui-tabs-tab\">\n  <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#example-color-fns-sass\" class=\"ui-tabs-anchor\">Sass</a>\n</li>\n</ul><div id=\"example-color-fns-scss\" class=\"ui-tabs-panel scss sl-c-code-panel\"><a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/playground#eJyNzMEOgjAMgOH7nqIhEjBBGRcP48KrFKxjScNMu8b49iJHT17/5P+GYTIlaBRVw5I5SzO6UxR8B1iVWw++hpuvz6NzfQ9CalwCFDHqYKYFv7diMcGS8gZJwbvpTrNFOLhr0sszv0iYVNtD7qBajaof8oGs9MfKKa5l28sOfAB/OD4U\" class=\"sl-c-to-playground\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <img class=\"sl-c-to-playground__logo\" height=\"24\" alt=\"Sass\" src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo.svg\">\n      Playground\n    </a><h3 class=\"visuallyhidden\">SCSS Syntax</h3><pre class=\"language-scss\"><code class=\"language-scss\"><span class=\"token keyword\">@use</span> <span class=\"token string\">'sass:color'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>&#10;<span class=\"token property\"><span class=\"token variable\">$gray</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">hsl</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>0 0% 60%<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>&#10;&#10;<span class=\"token comment\">// result: true, because saturation is 0</span>&#10;<span class=\"token keyword\">@debug</span> color.<span class=\"token function\">is-powerless</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token variable\">$gray</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"hue\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>&#10;&#10;<span class=\"token comment\">// result: false</span>&#10;<span class=\"token keyword\">@debug</span> color.<span class=\"token function\">is-powerless</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token variable\">$gray</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"lightness\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>&#10;</code></pre></div>\n<div id=\"example-color-fns-sass\" class=\"ui-tabs-panel sass ui-tabs-panel-inactive sl-c-code-panel\"><a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/playground#eJyNzDEOwjAMQNE9p7AqqrZSoWFhyNSruMUkkawG2bEqbg90Y2P90n/+OpsSdIqqYS1cpHOnKPgKkJR7D76Fm28H56YJhNS4BqhiNMJCK35fxWqCNZcNsoJ3850Wi3Bgl6znZ9lJmFT7Ax6hSUbNr/hAVvrj5BxT3T6lGd6usz0n\" class=\"sl-c-to-playground\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <img class=\"sl-c-to-playground__logo\" height=\"24\" alt=\"Sass\" src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo.svg\">\n      Playground\n    </a><h3 class=\"visuallyhidden\">Sass Syntax</h3><pre class=\"language-sass\"><code class=\"language-sass\"><span class=\"token atrule-line\"><span class=\"token atrule\">@use</span> 'sass:color'</span>&#10;<span class=\"token variable-line\"><span class=\"token variable\">$gray</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> hsl(0 0<span class=\"token operator\">%</span> 60<span class=\"token operator\">%</span>)</span>&#10;&#10;<span class=\"token comment\">// result: true, because saturation is 0</span>&#10;<span class=\"token atrule-line\"><span class=\"token atrule\">@debug</span> color.is-powerless($gray, \"hue\")</span>&#10;&#10;<span class=\"token comment\">// result: false</span>&#10;<span class=\"token atrule-line\"><span class=\"token atrule\">@debug</span> color.is-powerless($gray, \"lightness\")</span>&#10;</code></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Taking that a step farther, CSS also allows us to explicitly mark a channel as 'missing' or unknown.

Browsers are still debating the details, but everyone agrees we have to display <em>something</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently, browsers convert every color into <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, and <code>blue</code> channels for display. If any of those channels are too high or two low for a given screen, they get <em>clamped</em> at the highest or lowest value allowed. This is often referred to as 'channel clipping'. It keeps the math simple, but it can have a weird effect on both the <code>hue</code> and <code>lightness</code> if some channels are clipped more than others.</li>\n<li>The CSS specification says that preserving <code>lightness</code> should be the highest priority, and provides an algorithm for reducing <code>chroma</code> until the color is in gamut. That's great for maintaining readable text, but it's more work for browsers, and it can be surprising when colors suddenly lose their vibrance.</li>\n<li>There's been some progress on a compromise approach, reducing <code>chroma</code> to get colors inside the <code>rec2020</code> gamut, and clipping from there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since browser behavior is still unreliable, and some color spaces (<em>cough</em> <code>oklch</code>) can easily launch us out of any available gamut, it can be helpful to do some gamut management in Sass.</p>\n<p>We can use <code>color.is-in-gamut()</code> to test if a particular color is in a given gamut. Like our other color functions, this will default to the space the color is defined in, but we can provide a <code>$space</code> parameter to test it against a different gamut:</p>\n<div class=\"code-example ui-tabs\">\n  <ul class=\"ui-tabs-nav ui-helper-reset ui-helper-clearfix\"><li class=\"ui-tabs-tab ui-tabs-active\">\n  <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#example-color-fns-scss\" class=\"ui-tabs-anchor\">SCSS</a>\n</li>\n<li class=\"ui-tabs-tab\">\n  <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/#example-color-fns-sass\" class=\"ui-tabs-anchor\">Sass</a>\n</li>\n</ul><div id=\"example-color-fns-scss\" class=\"ui-tabs-panel scss sl-c-code-panel\"><a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/playground#eJyVjUEKgzAURPc5xV8IKhittKkYN14l6jeERg35CbS3r9gupLtuZjHDe1PXfSSElBSRHDe7+bRjCT6DV9yZ9SHhKLPJkLPqxd0VLmUr6j1votmzEfc27xirKvBI0QYJwUcsYN48nCitlhhYP+EQ9cdZGuJm5ceQnS5/bLOy9NWR18MfogIScmpEeYB59wbodU0v\" class=\"sl-c-to-playground\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <img class=\"sl-c-to-playground__logo\" height=\"24\" alt=\"Sass\" src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo.svg\">\n      Playground\n    </a><h3 class=\"visuallyhidden\">SCSS Syntax</h3><pre class=\"language-scss\"><code class=\"language-scss\"><span class=\"token keyword\">@use</span> <span class=\"token string\">'sass:color'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>&#10;<span class=\"token property\"><span class=\"token variable\">$extra-pink</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>display-p3 0.951 0.457 0.7569<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>&#10;&#10;<span class=\"token comment\">// result: true, for display-p3 gamut</span>&#10;<span class=\"token keyword\">@debug</span> color.<span class=\"token function\">is-in-gamut</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token variable\">$extra-pink</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>&#10;&#10;<span class=\"token comment\">// result: false, for srgb gamut</span>&#10;<span class=\"token keyword\">@debug</span> color.<span class=\"token function\">is-in-gamut</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token variable\">$extra-pink</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token property\"><span class=\"token variable\">$space</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> srgb<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>&#10;</code></pre></div>\n<div id=\"example-color-fns-sass\" class=\"ui-tabs-panel sass ui-tabs-panel-inactive sl-c-code-panel\"><a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/playground#eJyVjTsOgzAQRHufYgskQMJ8lBCEK66ygLGsONjy2lJy+yAnBSnTTDGj96btpkgSckIisVhjfc4y+QweudP7XUDqilWTM/ji7gJtPfbdkdd+OHLob2PJWNOAlxRNEBB8lBVs1sMJUviIgU2rnKP6KGtNXO88DcXp8Ve2oaGvjbya//BUkJHDRYoElm/kE0xC\" class=\"sl-c-to-playground\" target=\"_blank\">\n      <img class=\"sl-c-to-playground__logo\" height=\"24\" alt=\"Sass\" src=\"https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo.svg\">\n      Playground\n    </a><h3 class=\"visuallyhidden\">Sass Syntax</h3><pre class=\"language-sass\"><code class=\"language-sass\"><span class=\"token atrule-line\"><span class=\"token atrule\">@use</span> 'sass:color'</span>&#10;<span class=\"token variable-line\"><span class=\"token variable\">$extra-pink</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> color(display-p3 0.951 0.457 0.7569)</span>&#10;&#10;<span class=\"token comment\">// result: true, for display-p3 gamut</span>&#10;<span class=\"token atrule-line\"><span class=\"token atrule\">@debug</span> color.is-in-gamut($extra-pink)</span>&#10;&#10;<span class=\"token comment\">// result: false, for srgb gamut</span>&#10;<span class=\"token atrule-line\"><span class=\"token atrule\">@debug</span> color.is-in-gamut($extra-pink, $space: srgb)</span>&#10;</code></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>We can also use the <code>color.to-gamut()</code> function to explicitly move a color so that it is in a particular gamut.

Today, I'm excited to announce that this\nfeature has shipped in Dart Sass 1.71.0!</p>\n<p>No longer will you have to manually add <code>node_modules</code> to your <code>loadPaths</code>\noption and worry about whether nested packages will work at all. No longer will\nyou need to add <code>~</code>s to your URLs and give up all portability.

We've implemented one for\nthe Node.js module algorithm, but you could implement one that loads Sass files\nfrom <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/\">RubyGems</a> or <a href=\"https://pypi.org/\">PyPI</a> or <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a>.
