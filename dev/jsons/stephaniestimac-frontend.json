    "title": "Hello world...",
    "partialText": "<p class=\"blog-post__date\">8 July 2019</p>\n<p>Hello world! I've been blogging for what seems like a very very <em>very</em> long time. However, all that blogging over the years has been focused on fashion, lifestyle and travel over on another URL and lately, I've been wanting to dig into more design and front-end focused things and write about them. I have a handful of CSS Grid experiments I did a while ago and didn't write much (read: anything) to go with them and that's just not the way experiments with code should go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-on-microsoft-edge-and-browser-devtools\">Working on Microsoft Edge and Browser DevTools <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/firstpost/#working-on-microsoft-edge-and-browser-devtools\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Microsoft Edge team has gone through some massive changes over the last year, and I've been through so many reorgs I'm a bit dizzy and disoriented by this point but I get to straddle two separate areas in my work: design and product. For design, I do work for Developer Experiences, mostly focusing on webhint and the browser developer tools (DevTools). I am a pixel pusher at heart but the other portion of the work I do is in the Program Management org: talking to developers, evangelizing Edge, and overall finding ways to connect with the community.</p>\n<p>And I love all aspects of my job but when we talk about developers a lot of us tend to focus on those writing JavaScript or other programming languages, but not HTML and CSS which is what I love and like to focus on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"designer-or-developer%3F-a-bit-of-both\">Designer or Developer? A Bit of Both <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/firstpost/#designer-or-developer%3F-a-bit-of-both\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I find myself again straddling two worlds when it comes to front-end design: I come from a graphic design discipline, but producing website mockups to be handed off to a developer wasn't enough for me, I also dipped my toes into web development. I can write HTML and CSS and if you need me to, I can figure out some JavaScript but what I'm really passionate about is the design and layout side of things: like what problems can we solve with CSS Grid? What about Subgrid? And how on earth do we get back to creating websites that don't all look the same? There's so much fun we can have on the web and I want to play with all the good things coming out.</p>\n<p>And what about tooling for these things? Firefox has some great tooling for Grid and Flexbox, but I work on Edge. I want to know how we can make these things better. What else do front-end developers who focus on design need? What doesn't work?</p>\n<p>All these things and more are things I want to explore in this blog, so welcome to what I hope will be a different corner of the internet for me to own.</p>\n<p>Stephanie</p>",

    "title": "First thoughts & musings on playing with CSS Subgrid",
    "partialText": "<p class=\"blog-post__date\">9 July 2019</p>\n<p>First things first: CSS Subgrid is currently available in Firefox Nightly. In order to view this experiment properly, you've got to install Firefox Nightly. This isn't a particularly in-depth experiment or demo with CSS Subgrid but rather I wanted to get a feel for what it could do and start to brainstorm use cases.</p>\n<p>Here is some initial reading/watching/listening to do on Subgrid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rachel Andrew talked about Subgrid at CSSConfEU: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxOj7CaWiPU\">Hello Subgrid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid\">MDN Docs: CSS Subgrid</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"subgrid%3A-what-is-it%3F\">Subgrid: What is it? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/07-2019_subgrid/#subgrid%3A-what-is-it%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Currently in CSS Grid, when you create a grid container inside another grid container, the nested grid is independent of its parent grid. With Subgrid, in your nested grid container, you can apply<br />\n<code>grid-template-columns: subgrid;</code> and/or <code>grid-template-rows: subgrid;</code> and your nested grid with inherit the parent's column, row and gap sizing. You can choose to have your nested grid item inherit both columns and rows from its parent or just one of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-with-grid-template-columns%3A-subgrid%3B\">Example with <code>grid-template-columns: subgrid;</code> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/07-2019_subgrid/#example-with-grid-template-columns%3A-subgrid%3B\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In this example, I've created a grid container and nested div that I've placed along the parent grid. This nested div spans from columns 3 to 11 and rows 3 to 6.</p>\n<p>I then apply <code>display:grid;</code> to the nested div and then add <code>grid-template-columns: subgrid;</code> which will inherit the parent grid's column tracks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-1/grid-1.png\" alt=\"alt: subgrid exmaple\" /></p>\n<p>For this example, I set a different row height, independent of the parent grid, to repeat 4 times at a height of 40px. Here, my subgrid actually extends past the rows I said my nested item would span (rows 3 to 6), and the background color I've applied to my subgrid actually stays confined to those rows of the parent grid, hence the overlap effect with item 10.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-1/subgrid-2.png\" alt=\"alt: subgrid exmaple\" /></p>\n<p>But the important part here is that the nested grid is inheriting the parent grid's column tracks by simply using <code>grid-template-columns: subgrid;</code>. Here's a codepen of the current example:</p>\n<div class=\"codepen\">\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-default-tab=\"css\" data-user=\"seaotta\" data-slug-hash=\"pXQeYa\" style=\"height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"Basic Subgrid Example\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/seaotta/pen/pXQeYa/\">\n  Basic Subgrid Example</a> by 🌙 Stephanie (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/seaotta\">@seaotta</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"a-larger-subgrid-columns-example\">A larger subgrid columns example <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/07-2019_subgrid/#a-larger-subgrid-columns-example\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Again, this next example focuses mostly on utilizing subgrid to inherit column tracks from the parent grid. I am currently working on another example that uses <code>grid-template-rows: subgrid;</code> for another post, but because of the tendency for things to be laid out in a vertical rhythm on the web, most of my ideas for exploring subgrid have been around inheriting the parent grid's columns.</p>\n<p>You can find the full page of this example under my CSS Grid Experiments: <a href=\"https://stephaniestimac.com/css-grid-experiments/project5/good-omens-subgrid\">CSS Subgrid &amp; Good Omens</a>, and yes, I am a huge nerd because the Good Omens adaptation delighted me so much I dropped in quotes from the book and photos from the show because one should love what they create.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-1/good-omens.png\" alt=\"alt: larger layout example\" /></p>\n<p>I won't go into as much detail with this layout, but explain briefly what I did.</p>\n<p>I setup the parent grid with the intent to have chunks of text that span 4 columns and then have a nested section under those chunks of text with 4 distinct columns and content that inherit the parent grid's columns and gaps.</p>\n<p>Within the first subgrid, I've explicitly defined where each column should be placed and how many rows it should span and we get the illusion of a layout that may be complicated if trying to replicate using something other than grid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-1/subgrid-go.png\" alt=\"alt: subgrid with 4 columns\" /></p>\n<p>I then place another block of text below this nested grid container (and placed on the parent grid.) Below this, I created another nested grid container item, inheriting the parent grid column tracks again and perfectly aligning the columns to the parent and the first nested subgrid layout.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-1/bottom-subgrid.png\" alt=\"alt: subgrid with 4 columns\" /></p>\n<p>And then because I can, I placed another item on the parent grid that is top-aligned with the second subgrid by sharing the same row start. Ta-da!</p>\n<h2 id=\"overall-thoughts\">Overall thoughts <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/07-2019_subgrid/#overall-thoughts\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Subgrid makes alignment within a large layout much easier to manage. This post with the examples was just a way for me to start to dip my toes into what's possible with subgrid &amp; I hope to work on a few more posts with patterns that would benefit and be simplified by the use of subgrid.</p>\n<p>As someone who works on the DevTools UX for Edge, I even have a few ideas around how to improve the experience for viewing subgrid in the DevTools but first other browsers need to start implementing the spec for it.</p>\n<p>Stephanie</p>",

    "title": "I'm an introvert and I gave a conference talk",
    "partialText": "<p>I gave my first conference talk at Design It Build It conference in September this year. After my talk, an attendee invited me to connect on LinkedIn and in his message to me, asked how I had overcome being an introvert to give my talk.</p>\n<p>And while I understood the sentiment, I want to be clear: I didn’t overcome being an introvert in any way but have been on a very long and winding journey since autumn of 2016 that encompasses fundamentally understanding what it means to be introvert and embracing that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-3/dibi-me.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Stephanie speaking at Dibi Conf\" /><br />\n<em>Photo: Jim Richardson DiBi organizer</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"some-background\">Some background <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-19-2019-first-talk/#some-background\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I was 8 months into my role at Microsoft on the Edge team when I had the opportunity to go to Grace Hopper in Houston in the autumn of 2016. My experience as a whole wasn’t stellar. I didn’t really feel connected to any of the Microsoft employees there even though we had a huge presence, so I felt pretty alone for the few days I was there. Through the loneliness though, the experience was worth it for one session I attended.</p>\n<p>Susan Cain, the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153\">Quiet: The Power of Introverts</a>, was giving a talk on introverts. It was a life-changing session for me.</p>\n<p>She went into the scientific details of how the brain of introverts are wired differently from those of extroverts. She also talked about the misconception that introversion means you are shy. Introverts are more often shy, but it’s not necessarily a defining feature. (I was extremely shy and have improved my social skills over the last few years.)</p>\n<p>In her 50-minute session, I suddenly connected all these dots to different things I’d experienced in my life as far back as grade school. Something wasn’t in fact wrong with me, the world has just catered to extroverts up until recently. I have memories from grade and high school that haunt me to this day because I couldn’t articulate something thoughtfully on the spot. Introverts require time to digest things, mull things over. I wanted to cry, because everything suddenly made so much sense.</p>\n<p>As it turns out speaking is actually suited for introverts – as I wrote my talk, I was able to thoughtfully craft my story and what I wanted to tell. It was perfect really. As a speaker, afterwards, people would come up to talk to me about my talk and I at least had something I could talk about. I feel I’m really quite terrible one on one and would much prefer a deeper conversation than small talk.</p>\n<p>All that was left was to get over the fear of public speaking, which is no small feat. A year ago, I was pretty content in my decision to never speak at a conference. It wasn’t in the cards, I told myself. A year and a half previously I was supposed to do a co-presentation and had such a severe panic attack I dropped out of it. I wasn’t even really necessary for the talk so it was fine, but I still felt like a little bit of a failure for backing out. I accepted it and moved on. I found joy in attending conferences that Edge was sponsoring and being the booth person that developers would come talk to.</p>\n<p>This was again another thing that helped me along my path: I found I enjoyed standing at the booth talking to people because I knew what my goals were and what I was supposed to be asking. So little by little, just talking to people didn’t intimidate me so much. Even though I was exhausted at the end of the day, I felt accomplished and enjoyed the connections I would make even if they were brief.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-cfp-for-dibi\">The CFP for DiBi <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-19-2019-first-talk/#the-cfp-for-dibi\">#</a></h2>\n<p>My journey to my first conference talk began when the CFP for the conference came through in the spring. DiBi had been on my list because it was in Scotland so I was signed up to receive emails. The conference theme for 2019 was luck and the presentation time was 20-30 minutes. I paused when I saw that and thought, “I have a story about luck and my career that I could fill 20 minutes with…and it’s in Edinburgh, my favorite city….yeah I could do that.”</p>\n<p>It started with simply believing I could do it, and when my talk was accepted…my heart jumped. I absolutely could do this and there was no backing out now. I wrote out my entire talk by the end of June. I made revisions up until two weeks before the conference in September. I would think of two of my female coworkers and tell myself, “They can do it…so I know I can do it.”</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t just the fact that I practiced my talk every day for two months. While preparation is key, the past year has been a year of tremendous personal growth for me – it has been tumultuous and there have been tears and frustration and panic, unrelated to any conference talk. And I know I’ve come out stronger because of it. This coupled with Mindfulness training I have been taking at Microsoft, run by my former manager, has been a tremendous help to myself.</p>\n<p>I had already overcame so much, this just felt like the right hill to climb at the time. The conference was in a city I loved, with an audience I felt I was connected to, and I had a story to tell so this was the right conference to start with. I knew it in my gut.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-mind-of-an-introvert\">The mind of an introvert <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-19-2019-first-talk/#the-mind-of-an-introvert\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I recently learned that self-compassion or self-care can fundamentally re-wire your brain to build self-confidence. Instead of being hard on yourself, talk to yourself like you would a friend. As I practiced my talk, I would stumble and mess up or have to start a slide over...I took care to not be hard on myself. I took care to be kind. I stopped and took a breath and gave myself a little self-love.</p>\n<p>The first part of being an introvert is accepting you are one and that a fundamental part of surviving as one, is learning what form of self-care you need.</p>\n<p>Introverts require recharging after group events because of the way we process everything happening around us drains us. I notice this the most when I am with my rambunctious group of best friends. They are loud and brash and funny, I love them dearly, but I tend to notice everything happening in the background: the 15 different side conversations, the dancing, the music…I process it all. Rather than keep up, I now know when I need to call it a night. I remove myself and find quiet. It’s trusting myself to know what I need and when to stop.</p>\n<p>As for public speaking – for me, it was about finding my support network: my coworkers that sat through my dry-run and my friends outside of work, who built me up in the week before the conference, the ones who let me express my jitters (almost everyday) and gave me shoe advice when I couldn’t figure out which pair of shoes to go with the dress I bought. (Yes, I bought a dress just for the conference.) The support network was another piece of care I identified that I needed in order to get through things.</p>\n<p>I was still nervous the day of the talk: I could barely eat breakfast and my talk was the first one after lunch, so I couldn’t stomach lunch either. But I had spent months preparing for this moment and as I was three quarters of the way through my talk, a little voice in my head went: “you’re almost done!” I learned that nerves are normal, that that part of public speaking never really goes away. It’s important to acknowledge them as they come up and sit with them and then let them go.</p>\n<p>And then this is where that self-care and self-compassion comes in even more. I left the conference at the end of the day and wandered down the Royal Mile to find some food and a cider and sit by myself to decompress. This was a big accomplishment and the jitters had absolutely taken a physical toll on me that day and it was okay to not go to the sponsored party after.</p>\n<p>It’s okay to know your limits and say no.</p>\n<h2 id=\"be-kind\">Be kind <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-19-2019-first-talk/#be-kind\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Be compassionate to yourself and you’ll find you can go farther than you think. That might sound a bit cheesy, and it probably is, but it’s the truth. Self-care, mindfulnesss training, and trusting the people around me got me to my first talk and through it.</p>\n<p>No one came up afterwards with harsh or cruel words, everyone was kind online. One thing someone told me when I asked Twitter for public speaking tips was how the audience isn’t your enemy, no one wants you to fail. And I felt that energy in the room.</p>\n<p>So to the kind fellow who asked me how I overcame introversion…my answer to you is this: <strong>I didn’t.</strong></p>\n<p>I embraced it because it is fundamentally a part of who I am: it is quite literally wired into my brain. Pretending to be someone I’m not was never an option, and that’s what I missed the first time around when I dropped out of that co-talk. I was fighting myself instead of working with it. And now that I know what I need, I am well-equipped to take on any challenge large or small.</p>\n<p>I don't have comments enabled on here yet (my to-do list is astounding), but you can let me know your thoughts on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Twitter</a>. I'm on there far too often.</p>",

    "title": "Location, Privilege and Performant Websites",
    "partialText": "<p>I would say that I live an extremely privileged and comfortable life. The privilege from having a good paying career in a large tech company opened up the opportunity to live in a home, on much more land than you’d get in the city, 30 miles outside of downtown Seattle.</p>\n<p>Though to some friends it feels as though I’m really far outside the city, I’m technically a part of the Seattle Metropolitan Area and despite being in a rural area, I’m close enough to Redmond and Bellevue that something like mobile phone and data coverage shouldn’t be an issue.</p>\n<p>These two things were not things I really paid attention to while looking for a place to live unless the property was so far out that there was no coverage at all. I figured once the internet was installed, I wouldn’t have to worry about spotty coverage. I would have WiFi and it would be fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-unreliable-network\">An Unreliable Network <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-30-2019-performance/#an-unreliable-network\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I was later proved wrong though, about not having to worry about data and cell coverage; the power went out and with it, internet connectivity. Wind storms and even a hard rain can knock the power out where I live and in the winter it’s a somewhat common occurrence. For the most part, power is restored within an hour or two, but there have been a few severe wind storms and one was so severe last February that the wind woke me up at 2:30 AM.</p>\n<p>While I ran upstairs to try and assess what was happening outside with branches snapping and loud booms of trees falling in the distance, I attempted to reach the Puget Sound Energy website on my mobile browser to report the outage.</p>\n<p>I refreshed the page multiple times while my phone said I had data coverage and was on the network (one, maybe two bars at times), but the PSE page came up as offline. I finally managed to get the page to load to report the outage after about 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>In the morning, the power was still out and it was clear this has been a devastating wind storm. Electrical fires were being started by downed power lines, trees were blocking two out of three exits out of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Since I didn’t have a generator, I was without power and internet for nearly 24 hours. Many updates were being posted to Facebook and Twitter but those struggled to load just as the PSE Outage listing page did. I couldn’t access the information I needed about repairs or status of the repairs. It was frustrating and isolating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unused-javascript\">Unused JavaScript <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-30-2019-performance/#unused-javascript\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After the storm, I was determined to find out why the 'Report An Outage' page was so painful to download.</p>\n<p>I profiled the PSE Outage page after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1085439006433669120\">Addy Osmani tweeted</a> about using the Coverage panel in the DevTools to check how much unused JavaScript was being loaded.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-4/coverage-panel.png\" alt=\"alt: Edge DevTools Coverage Panel\" /></p>\n<p>There were 4.6MB of unused code being downloaded on a page whose main and only content, apart from a sign in button, is a form to submit your address.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-4/webhint-perf-budget.png\" alt=\"alt: webhint.io performance budget hint\" /></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-performance-budget/\">webhint's Performance Budget hint</a>, on a 4G network, it will take a staggering 55.3s to load all the resources.</p>\n<p>The results from <a href=\"https://web.dev/\">web.dev</a> aren't great either. Performance as a category got a zero.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-4/webdev-analysis.png\" alt=\"alt: https://web.dev screenshot showing 0 performance score\" /></p>\n<p>I personally don’t have to worry about how much data I’m using to load web pages on my phone but that doesn’t mean I want to spend time waiting for megabytes of unused code to slow down my access to a website, especially when I can’t access a WiFi point.</p>\n<p>On the other end, there are people who have to worry about how much data they use. Trying to simply report an outage or get an update on when power could be restored should not cause additional anxiety in a situation. Whether it’s anxiety about a lack of access to information or anxiety about how much their phone bill is going to be because of how much it took to load a page whose size could be reduced immensely if developers took a little more care to assess what it is they’re serving to their customers.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that in trying to serve all that extra JavaScript, your phone is working harder and the battery will drain quicker, which normally wouldn’t be such an issue but when you don’t have power in a storm or natural disaster, that becomes a concerning situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privilege-in-code\">Privilege in Code <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-30-2019-performance/#privilege-in-code\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Unconscious privilege hides in delivering so much unused code to customers. In not taking the time to understand what the implications are of using the code you choose to use and how large those files are, we assume that all of our customers are in the same situation with the same access to resources.</p>\n<p>NPR smartly chose to build a <a href=\"https://text.npr.org/\">text-only</a> website so that people with limited internet connectivity during Hurricane Irma could receive up-to-date news.</p>\n<p>If you do assess your code and for whatever reasons find that you cannot reduce the size of your website, be it time or staffing propose adding a text-only website, especially if you provide a service that is essential to most of the population in your area.</p>\n<p>Your text only website doesn’t need to be a text-only version of every single piece of content on the site either. Figure out what the essential pieces your customers need access to are and build it with plain, semantic HTML.<br />\nPersonally, when I’m in a situation where I don’t have power due to a weather event, I’m not concerned about what your website looks like. I don’t care about the branding or interactivity or being delighted. I care about information and whether I have been given an option to find what I need easily and without hindrance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-web-for-all\">A Web for All <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-30-2019-performance/#a-web-for-all\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Assuming all of your customers are living the same life, with the same privilege, with the same access to fast internet and data is the quickest way to ensure you’re excluding some of them and not providing the same level of service the rest get. It’s most likely not even happening intentionally, bias is inherent in us all in some way or another. Bias based on location is something I hadn’t considered before my experience on a subpar network due to where I live.</p>\n<p>But if you’re providing a service or utility that is essential to a large portion of your community, it’s important to take a step back and assess your user experience from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>One might assume that because Seattle is a booming tech area, we should all have access to fast internet and top of the line devices. But this isn’t the case, and Seattle is not in fact full of people in tech living privileged lives due to their salaries. Many don’t live in Seattle, or even Bellevue proper due to the cost of living and when your customer base spans urban to extremely rural, you need to ensure your rural customers have the same access as the urban ones.</p>\n<p>In Unincorporated King County, where I live, the 2018 <a href=\"https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/executive/performance-strategy-budget/regional-planning/Demographics/Dec-2018-Update/UKC_profile_2018.ashx?la=en\">census estimate for population was 247,240</a> (PDF). King County is only one of many counties that Puget Sound Energy serves with a customer base of 1.1 million. If everyone in this demographic had PSE as their electricity provider, that’s 22% of customers who live in a suburban to rural setting. That’s 1 in 5 people. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/08/rural-america.html\">according to the United States Census Bureau</a>, 60 million Americans, that is 1 in 5, live in rural areas. To ignore the needs of 20% of the population is egregious.</p>\n<p>Testing on a &lt;$100 Android device on a 3G network should be an integral part of testing your website.

    "title": "Beyond Tellerrand Berlin 2019",
    "partialText": "<p>There isn't a day that goes by that I feel extremely privileged to do what I get to do for work. Last week, I flew out to Berlin for a few days to attend Beyond Tellerrand. My co-worker Aaron was speaking and running a workshop and I emceed the community focused session we've been running for the past few months, <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">The Web We Want</a>, in the evening on day one.</p>\n<p>Despite technical issues with my laptop, for the second event in a row, the session went well and there was great conversation from our panel of judges.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-5/IMG_4426.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Beyond Tellerrand stage\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-web-we-want\">The Web We Want <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/11-19-19-btconf-berlin/#the-web-we-want\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As we've started to get the hang of running this community focused session, I've been so thrilled to see folks step up to either present at the event or submit a video detailing their wants for the web. We want everyone to submit their wants for the web, whether they can be at an event or not, but I am absolutely delighted by the presentations we've had at the events. My team and I are more than happy to present on folk's behalf, but only you can know the details and the use cases of the problem you want solved. I really get so much joy seeing how deeply the community has thought about the problems they've encountered.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">The Web We Want</a> if you've never heard of it before. It's a cross-browser, community focused initiative where we ask the question: &quot;if you could change one thing about the web platform, what would it be?&quot; We then run live pitch sessions at conferences and meetups with a panel of industry experts who discuss each item pitched and then pick their favorite.</p>\n<p>I've been emceeing most of the sessions and it's been a blast for me. If you're interested in having The Web We Want at your meetup or conference, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:steph.stimac@gmail.com\">reach out on email</a> or on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beyond-tellerrand-berlin\">Beyond Tellerrand Berlin <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/11-19-19-btconf-berlin/#beyond-tellerrand-berlin\">#</a></h2>\n<p>But now a few words on the conference as a whole. I hadn't been to Beyond Tellerrand before but what an absolutely astoundingly inspiring conference. It's a beautiful intersection of tech and humanity. I've never felt so hungry to dive into a bunch of side projects and explore and just create. It was honestly the perfect mix of technical + web talks and art + humanity talks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sharonsteed\">Sharon Steed</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annaginsburg\">Anna Ginsburg</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cassiecodes\">Cassie Evans</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natalyathree\">Natalya Shelburne</a> were some of my favorite speakers from the conference. It's amazing to see so many strong women on the stage sharing their stories and their work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcthiele\">Marc Thiele</a> has done such an absolutely fantastic job of creating an inspiring conference. If you can find your way to Germany next year, <a href=\"https://beyondtellerrand.com/\">there are three events</a>. My fingers are crossed that I get to participate in one of these events again. It was inclusive, the lineup was diverse, the talks were diverse and the Berlin venue was so cool. It was such a good experience, words really quite can't adequately describe how inspired I feel after attending. I'm just rambling at this point. So that's all for now folks.</p>\n<p>Stephanie</p>",

    "title": "Building my bullet journal layout with CSS Grid & Subgrid & Flexbox",
    "partialText": "<p>This is a post about how I built my bullet journal demo that you can find over <a href=\"https://stephaniestimac.com/css-grid-experiments/project6/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>My bullet journal layout is pretty simple compared to some of the more elaborate, colorful and playful layouts I’ve seen. I mainly use my bullet journal to track a few monthly goals, bills, my weekly tasks and my schedule.</p>\n<p>My work calendar can become full of non-blocking “Office Hours” and tech talks that I may or may not have time to go to. Basically: digital calendar clutter can muddy my view of the week, and, perhaps it’s the designer in me, I prefer to keep some sort of hand written view of my week.  (And also practice my hand-lettering. Like I said: designer.)</p>\n<p>Here is what my actual bullet journal looks like, but the bottom half layout can vary as I usually track the bills due between the 1st and the 15th on the first weekly spread, and the bills due on the 16th and the end of the month on the third weekly spread.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-6/bullet-journal.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Parent grid layout in Firefox Grid Inspector\" /></p>\n<p>This layout only has my meal plan section and weekly to-do. From the image above you can see that the layout varies below the daily time tables.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-the-grid\">Defining the grid <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-29-2019-bullet-journal/#defining-the-grid\">#</a></h2>\n<p>First, I defined the grid layout I wanted for the whole page. There was no real math behind this, I visually assessed and re-adjusted the grid based on the content I knew I’d be filling in and then went from there.</p>\n<pre><code>.grid-container { \n    display: grid; \n    grid-gap: 1rem;\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(10rem, 1fr));\n    grid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(5rem, 10rem));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-6/grid-parent.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Parent grid layout in Firefox Grid Inspector\" /></p>\n<p>For the columns, I wanted to be able to expand the entire layout to fit onto one row if the viewport width was large enough but still wrap cleanly onto new lines if the viewport was small, like on a phone screen. I used <code>repeat</code> and <code>auto-fit</code> to expand into any available space, and the columns are set to be a minimum of <code>10rem</code> wide so that the timetables don’t get too narrow, and a max of <code>1fr</code> so that columns are flexible.</p>\n<p>To tackle the building the rest of the journal, I divided it into major sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The “Day Grid”: the entire week</li>\n<li>The week layout grid will then breakdown into individual days and hours</li>\n<li>The meal plan</li>\n<li>My to-do list</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"a-note-on-auto-fill-vs.-auto-fit\">A note on <code>auto-fill</code> vs. <code>auto-fit</code> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-29-2019-bullet-journal/#a-note-on-auto-fill-vs.-auto-fit\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There are lots of resources available on auto-fill vs. auto-fit. Sara Soueidan and Rachel Andrew have some useful write-ups already:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/\">Sara Soueidan: Auto-Sizing Columns in CSS Grid: auto-fill vs auto-fit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gridbyexample.com/examples/example37/\">Rachel Andrew: auto-fill vs. auto-fit</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-day-grid\">The Day Grid <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-29-2019-bullet-journal/#the-day-grid\">#</a></h2>\n<pre><code>.day-grid { \n    display: grid; \n    grid-gap: 1rem; \n    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(10rem, 1fr));\n    grid-template-columns: subgrid;\n    grid-column-start: 1; \n    grid-column-end: 8; \n    grid-row-start: 1; \n    grid-row-end: 6; \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-6/grid-weekly.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Weekly grid layout in Firefox Grid Inspector\" /></p>\n<p>Here I define the grid for the daily timetable columns. I also want this to utilize CSS Grid and I want the columns to inherit their sizing from the parent grid, so I use subgrid. But subgrid isn’t supported in all browsers yet so I re-define the template columns from the parent grid. I define where I want the day grid to sit on the parent grid with <code>grid-column-start</code>, <code>grid-column-end</code>, <code>grid-row-start</code>, <code>grid-row-end</code>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s dive into the individual column layout. Each day is defined as an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and I’ve defined a grid for each day column.</p>\n<pre><code>article { \n    display: grid; \n    grid-template-columns: 2.5rem 1rem 1fr; \n    grid-template-rows: repeat(12, minmax(2rem, 1fr)); \n} \n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-6/grid-daily.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Daily grid layout in Firefox Grid Inspector\" /></p>\n<p>The columns are divided up into three sub-columns: the time, the busy block or the fill pattern to indicate a block, and the content container to write the activity for that time block. These columns are set at <code>2.5rem</code> wide, <code>1rem</code> wide, and <code>1fr</code> to use up the remaining space since the content in the third column will vary in length.</p>\n<p>Now onto the rows. I’ve divided my days up into 11-hour days because the bulk of my scheduled day happens between those times, but there are 12 rows defined because the day heading sits within the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> grid. The height of the rows has a minimum of <code>2rem</code> and a max of <code>1fr</code>, again for flexibility.</p>\n<p>Each row is representative of an hour (though in my actual bullet journal, each row is representative of a half hour), and I have the following code for the row:</p>\n<pre><code>.day-grid-hour { \n    display: grid; \n    grid-template-columns: 2.5rem 1rem 1fr;\n    grid-template-columns: subgrid;\n    grid-column: 1 / 4; \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-6/grid-hourly.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Hourly grid layout in Firefox Grid Inspector\" /></p>\n<p>Once again, I want the columns to inherit the parent column template so I use subgrid and then re-define with the integers again for fallback purposes. I also define the column placement with <code>grid-column: 1 / 4;</code>. Each hour will start at grid line 1 and end at grid line 4. The row placement will be different for each hour though. I was trying to figure out if there was a way to get the rows to layout equally without having to define row start and end for each hour. If there is a way, please let me know on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-meal-plan-%26-the-to-do-list\">The meal plan &amp; the to-do list <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-29-2019-bullet-journal/#the-meal-plan-%26-the-to-do-list\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Both of these sections are just placed on the grid with <code>grid-column: span 2;</code> and <code>grid-row: span X;</code>, indicating that columns and rows should span however many columns or rows.</p>\n<p>I use <code>display: flex;</code> for the lists, though the meal plan has <code>display: flex;</code> applied to the container div and not the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, whereas the weekly to-do is the opposite. I’m not sure why I did this, so I’ll poke around and make an edi/note to the post when I figure out why.</p>\n<p>And then the weekly to-do list items each have <code>display: flex;</code> applied to them with <code>justify-content: space-between;</code> applied to align the checkboxes to the right and the text to the left. (Design note: ideally the checkboxes would be actual checkboxes, but I was more focused on the layout portion for this demo.)</p>\n<p>Code for the to-do list items:</p>\n<pre><code>.to-do-container ul li { \n    display: flex; \n    justify-content: space-between; \n    align-items: center; \n    padding: .2rem 0; \n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-29-2019-bullet-journal/#final-thoughts\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I want the biggest take away from this post to be about subgrid. Subgrid is incredibly powerful and will help improve building interesting layouts on the web. I can think of a number of instances where I want a layout to inherit the parent grid’s setup and subgrid will make that so much easier.</p>\n<p>For now, use subgrid, and continue to provide the fallback values. This is something I took away from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MiriSuzanne\">Miriam Suzanne’s</a> talk at Smashing Conf NYC. There is no reason not to be using features that are only available in a limited number of browsers: just provide a fallback or progressively enhance. Hopefully, the more these experimental features get used in the wild, browser makers will take notice and start to implement.</p>\n<p>So in 2020: keep using experimental features. Provide fallbacks. Build cool shit.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>This isn’t going to be a technical or necessarily professional focused recap. A lot happened this year and I’ve been trying to capture it in words, though I don’t think this post will fully capture the pace and craziness of this year. It’s a bit jumbled and a bit stream of consciousness at times. So strap in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-7/berlin.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Me in Berlin, hands in the air\" /><br />\n<em>Berlin, May 2019, right before it started pouring rain</em></p>\n<p>If you’d have told me at the beginning of the year what 2019 held for me personally and professionally, I’d probably have rolled my eyes and chuckled, maybe even scoffed.  “Abso-fucking-lutely <em>not</em>,” I would have said.</p>\n<p>That seems to be a recurring response in my life (from me) and perhaps that’s something I need to pay attention to. Life, no matter how hard you try to plan it, does not turn out how you ever envision it.</p>\n<p>I started the year with my closest friends in my home and then went on to have a root canal a few days later after pain so severe I couldn’t sleep or would be woken up once the painkillers wore off in the middle of the night. I couldn’t get into a dental surgeon for 5 days.</p>\n<p>2019, despite a seemingly positive, if rather haggard start with friends, had not started out great. Things were then relatively low-key. Things were looking like they were going to be low-key all year.</p>\n<p>March brought an extremely uncomfortable conversation at work that ultimately made me stronger, and ultimately affected the team for the better.</p>\n<p>Then an email from DiBi conference came through one day and I decided to submit my first CFP for a conference. I’m not sure why I did it, maybe Scotland was calling again, and I was accepted.</p>\n<p>April set the tone for the rest of the year, though I didn’t quite realize it then: I flew to Smashing Conf SF, flew home, and then 12 hours later left to go to Phoenix to see my family, then flew home a few days later and went straight to Easter weekend festivities with my closest friends. Looking back at all my travel this year, I did that quite a few times and I honestly kind of sort of <em>loved</em> it.</p>\n<p>May brought more work travel and more friend gatherings and some form of travel every single week. I also started a Mindfulness course at work that would last through the end of the year, which profoundly affected me and the way I respond to things.</p>\n<p>June mellowed out but brought a promotion at work (a title change!) and July picked back up again with Bass Coast Festival, another conference and the start of <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">The Web We Want</a>, before a small break in August.</p>\n<p>Then absolute insanity in September, October, November and December.</p>\n<p>In September I gave my first conference talk in front of 200 people and survived!</p>\n<p>October turned my world upside down. I wasn’t expecting it. I certainly wasn’t looking for it but as someone who believes the universe puts you where you need to be; I can’t help but believe I was exactly where I needed to be. Looking back there were too many factors that led me to that particular spot that were extremely out of character for me. I keep asking myself “why” and I don’t have an answer. There were a million and one excuses I could have made to avoid that spot. As an introvert, I’m good at doing that. But this time I didn’t and it sparked a lot of change. Some sad. Some good. All of it necessary. But I know what I felt.</p>\n<p>As I woke up early in New York and watched the sunrise from my bed on the 44th floor of my hotel on the first day of Smashing Conf NYC, I felt tired...but happy. I was at the end of a 6-week run of travel: a week in Scotland, a week at home, a little over a week in Amsterdam, a week at home, a week in New York, and then I was looking at a two-week break before more travel in November. It was exhausting and it’s certainly not sustainable forever but I was living for it.</p>\n<p>December, I found myself in Scotland again, my happy place with a dear friend and colleague. I went and I saw Skatebård in Edinburgh and I saw Palms Trax in Glasgow. I reveled in me-time. I went back to the same bar 4 nights in a row, made friends with the bartender and had the best drinks. I settled in to where the year has led me.</p>\n<p>And as the year draws to a close, tonight I will find myself with the same group of friends on New Year's Eve. Not in my home this time, someone else’s, but I’ll be with all the beautiful souls I care for deeply.</p>\n<h2 id=\"growth\">Growth <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-31-2019-year-end-review/#growth\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It was a year of tremendous growth.</p>\n<p>Of travel.</p>\n<p>Of goals fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Of things I didn’t even know I could do that I did.</p>\n<p>Of stress and overwhelming work.</p>\n<p>Of finding my voice.</p>\n<p>Of difficult decisions.</p>\n<p>Of putting my needs and care for myself first.</p>\n<p>Of connecting with people who inspire me.</p>\n<p>Of being validated by people in my industry I view as an inspiration.</p>\n<p>That last one may make you pause and say, others don’t need to validate you – and you’re absolutely correct, but that doesn’t take away the absolute joy I felt when those that inspire me told me to keep writing, told me to keep doing what I'm doing, told me that what I'd written was good, <em>really</em> good, told me that they respect me. Those words matter to someone who has consistently struggled with imposter syndrome and a feeling like I don’t belong. I feel like I’ve finally found my place.</p>\n<p>Yeah that imposter sneaks up on me from time to time and I’m sure it will for a while but I finally believe people when they tell me I’m good at what I do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"travel\">Travel <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-31-2019-year-end-review/#travel\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Anthony Bourdain put it so eloquently: “Travel changes you. As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life — and travel — leaves marks on you.”</p>\n<p>While my travel this year has been quick and all over the US and Europe, those marks in the form of friendships and connections made have left an unbelievable impression. I am hungry to connect with people outside my bubble. I never thought I’d be lucky enough to visit so many different places for work and get to tie in a personal day. I am extremely privileged.</p>\n<p>I used to struggle with international trips where I was by myself. But I shifted my perspective on my last trip to Berlin.</p>\n<p>How lucky am I? To have dinner by myself in Edinburgh or Berlin? To feel anxious about visiting a city where I don’t know the language? Those are feelings to be cherished because you get through them and they make you stronger. They make you feel more complete. They make the connections you make feel more special because you came to a city not knowing anyone and you left having connected with someone. And it’s a beautiful mark, no matter how big or small, because it’s a mark that was left on you, that changed you. For the better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2020\">2020 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-31-2019-year-end-review/#2020\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I’m not sure what 2020 holds for me. I know what I’d like to do. I know there are things I <em>have</em> to do. For the first time though, I'll be approaching things a bit differently. I will be embracing and asking, “why not?”</p>\n<p>Why not submit 30 CFPs for conference talks?</p>\n<p>Why not go to Burning Man finally?</p>\n<p>Why not join your friends and get into mountain biking?</p>\n<p>Why not plan another international girl’s trip? This time maybe more wine, more beach and less winter weather though.</p>\n<p>Why not do the things and revisit the dreams you forgot about long ago?</p>\n<p>Why <em>not</em>?</p>\n<h2 id=\"this-year\">This year <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/12-31-2019-year-end-review/#this-year\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I know when I write about it the way I have, the year doesn’t sound that bonkers, but it absolutely was for me. I found energy I didn't have 10 years ago. I don't know where it all came from.</p>\n<p>And it was incredibly transformative. I’ve had people from all parts of my life tell me how much I’ve grown and changed in the last year and I can feel it. I’m living it.  I'm happy with it.</p>\n<p>Life’s too short to be unhappy, and as we head into 2020 that’s what I’m taking with me.  See you all in 2020.</p>\n<p><em>(The title of this post is from Kate Bush’s song, Running Up That Hill, which has been on repeat a lot recently, well, the Meg Myers cover version has.

    "partialText": "<p>Last year I took a mindfulness course led by a former team lead who had switched careers at Microsoft. We had four in-person all day sessions and at the end of each session we would set intentions for the next few months between classes. Intentions are different than goals, as goals tend to be a fixed outcome and intentions focus on the present moment and don't necessarily have a set plan like a goal. So even though some of these have fixed outcomes, I really intend to focus on the intent and how I'm feeling in the moment about each of these things.</p>\n<p>One of the things I found with focusing on intentions is that I tended to be much kinder to myself if I hadn't been as diligent about my intentions.

    "title": "5 of my favorite hints in the webhint browser extension",
    "partialText": "<p>Full disclosure, the <a href=\"https://webhint.io/\">webhint</a> project is near and dear to my heart. It's a project I've been the lead designer and front-end dev for since 2017 and <a href=\"https://github.com/webhintio/artwork\">Nellie the Narwhal</a> is my baby. Though my focus at work has shifted away from designing full-time, I still pop in to fix or oversee design updates to the website.</p>\n<p>But that's not why I'm writing this post, I want to highlight just a few of the things that the webhint browser extension checks for when you scan a website from your DevTools.</p>\n<p>You can download the DevTools Browser Extension for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webhint/gccemnpihkbgkdmoogenkbkckppadcag\">Chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mlgfbihcfnkaenjpdcngdnhcpkdmcdee\">Edge</a> and <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webhint/\">Firefox</a>.</p>\n<p>If you install the extension and don't immediately see the 'Hints' panel, check your overflow menu, circled here:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-8/webhint-devtools.jpg\" alt=\"alt: Hints panel in DevTools\" /></p>\n<p>Now, onto some of my favorite things that webhint checks for with the browser DevTools extensions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1.-scoped-svg-styles\">1. Scoped SVG Styles <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/01-05-2020-webhint-hints/#1.-scoped-svg-styles\">#</a></h2>\n<p>webhint will check to see if any SVG styles are affecting elements in the DOM outside of the SVG. The webhint browser extension will tell you what CSS rule is causing an issue and the HTML elements being affected.</p>\n<p>Here's an example from webhint that would trigger the hint.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1 class=&quot;my-style&quot;&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n        &lt;svg&gt;\n            &lt;style&gt;\n                .my-style {\n                    opacity: 0.5;\n                }\n            &lt;/style&gt;\n            &lt;text class=&quot;my-style&quot;&gt;SVG text&lt;/text&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's the detailed webhint documentation on <a href=\"https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-scoped-svg-styles/\">scoped-svg-styles</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2.-supported-css-features\">2. Supported CSS Features <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/01-05-2020-webhint-hints/#2.-supported-css-features\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A lot of web developers have to support Internet Explorer still or just older browser versions in general. This happens in the enterprise space frequently because the cost of upgrading can be substantial therefore limiting how quickly enterprises upgrade.</p>\n<p>So if you're building something that needs to be supported on IE but still want to use newer web technology, webhint can help you out here.</p>\n<p>On my website for example, the hint gets triggered by <code>display: grid;</code> and throws the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'display: grid' is not supported by Internet Explorer. Add 'display: -ms-grid' to support Internet Explorer 10+.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It will also show me which file, the line location and code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-8/webhint.jpg\" alt=\"!alt: webhint browser extension screenshot\" /></p>\n<p>You can actually click on the file in webhint and it will pop you over to the DevTools Sources panel to the problematic spot in your code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/post-8/sources.jpg\" alt=\"alt: sources panel in DevTools\" /></p>\n<p>Here's the detailed webhint documentation on <a href=\"https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-compat-api/css/\">supported CSS features</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3.-all-of-the-accessibility-hints\">3. All of the Accessibility Hints <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/01-05-2020-webhint-hints/#3.-all-of-the-accessibility-hints\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Ok this is technically 14 hints grouped under one main category. Webhint uses axe for its accessibility check and covers all of the following areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ARIA</li>\n<li>Color</li>\n<li>Forms</li>\n<li>Keyboard</li>\n<li>Language</li>\n<li>Name role value</li>\n<li>Other</li>\n<li>Parsing</li>\n<li>Semantics</li>\n<li>Sensory and visual cues</li>\n<li>Structure</li>\n<li>Tables</li>\n<li>Text alternatives</li>\n<li>Time and media</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few examples of errors I've seen come up outside of color, which is probably one of the most frequent ones I see.</p>\n<p><strong>Structure</strong> hint that gets triggered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements must be contained in a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ol&gt; </code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Name role value</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Links must have discernible text<br />\n<code>&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;search&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-search&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Webhint will also link you over to the Elements panel to show you where in your HTML the offending element is. You can toggle back and forth between the two panels.</p>\n<p>Here's the webhint documentation on the <a href=\"https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-axe/\">axe accessibility check</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4.-no-vulnerable-libraries\">4. No vulnerable libraries <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/01-05-2020-webhint-hints/#4.-no-vulnerable-libraries\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This hint will check for known vulnerabilities within client-side JavaScript libraries and frameworks detected on the website you're testing against. Webhint uses Snyk's vulnerabilities DB to look these up.</p>\n<p>An example that gets thrown on an old WordPress site of mine:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'jQuery@1.12.4' has 2 known vulnerabilities (2 medium). See <code>https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jquery</code> for more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's the webhint documentation on the <a href=\"https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-no-vulnerable-javascript-libraries/\">vulnerable libraries</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5.-external-links-disown-opener\">5. External links disown opener <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/01-05-2020-webhint-hints/#5.-external-links-disown-opener\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Webhint will check your links that have <code>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</code> applied to them to make sure <code>rel=&quot;noopener&quot;</code> (and <code>noreferrer</code> for older browsers) are also applied due to a security issue if they're not.</p>\n<p>If you're like me, you occasionally forget this or miss it here and there while other links in your site are fine. This is a good but simple backup check. Ultimately web devs are human and might miss something!</p>\n<p>Here's the webhint documentation on <a href=\"https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-disown-opener/\">external links disown opener</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webhint-in-your-dev-cycle\">webhint in your dev cycle <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/01-05-2020-webhint-hints/#webhint-in-your-dev-cycle\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The great thing about webhint is you can use it in many different forms across your development cycle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://webhint.io/\">Online scanner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/\">Webhint CLI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webhint.vscode-webhint\">VS Code Extension</a></li>\n<li>DevTools Browser Extension for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webhint/gccemnpihkbgkdmoogenkbkckppadcag\">Chrome</a>, <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mlgfbihcfnkaenjpdcngdnhcpkdmcdee\">Edge</a> and <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webhint/\">Firefox</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the CLI is extremely configurable: you can write your own hints if webhint is missing something you care about or you can remove something webhint checks for that you <em>don't</em> care about.</p>\n<p>Webhint is an open source project so check out the different <a href=\"https://github.com/webhintio\">GitHub repos</a> and start contributing today!</p>",

    "title": "Pushing the future of the platform forward with The Web We Want",
    "partialText": "<p>Last year I joined my co-worker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson\">Aaron Gustafson</a> in kicking off an initiative called <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">The Web We Want</a> that focuses on identifying pain points or gaps in the web platform as identified by developers and web designers.</p>\n<p>This project has become something I'm incredibly passionate about. It's a cross-platform effort with many browser vendors involved and looking at the problems that have been submitted so far.</p>\n<p>But we're not done yet! I'm looking forward to running this at a few events this year. I'll be at the SFHTML5 meetup in March and Smashing Conf San Francisco in April to moderate the session.</p>\n<p>The most important part of this initiative, for me, is community participation. This year I would love to see more of the community and event attendees presenting their submissions in the session.</p>\n<p>We've successfully presented on behalf of folks who couldn't attend – we definitely don't want the inability to attend an event to be a reason why a submission isn't shared – but the most compelling submissions have been the ones where a community member was able to present their idea either in person or via a recorded video.</p>\n<p>These are ultimately <em>your</em> pain points and you know them well and seeing the thoughtfulness that has gone into each video or in-person presentation has been incredibly rewarding and inspiring. There's a lot of passion in this community and I love to see it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-the-web-we-want-work%3F\">How does The Web We Want work? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/pushing-the-web-platform-forward/#how-does-the-web-we-want-work%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We would love to see more participation this year: more submissions and more videos or in-person submissions. I'll break down how the process goes leading up to a session, to the session and what happens after.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1.-think-of-a-problem-or-feature-gap-in-the-web-platform\">1. Think of a problem or feature gap in the web platform <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/pushing-the-web-platform-forward/#1.-think-of-a-problem-or-feature-gap-in-the-web-platform\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Start off by thinking of something you constantly have to hack around. Do you have to build something custom when you think there should be a native way or element for that thing? Maybe there's a feature missing in the browser DevTools that isn't there. Maybe there's an API you've thought of. Whatever it is: it can be extremely broad or very specific. Browser vendors want to know!</p>\n<p>Need some ideas? Here are some of the submissions from past events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/52/\">I want semantic HTML sidenotes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/74/\">I want better justification(text-align)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/4/\">I want a standard API for event throttling and debouncing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/79/\">I want improved behavior of browser emulators to match the interaction on mobile devices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/60/\">I want to be able to save/load a debugger state</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2.-submit-your-idea\">2. Submit your idea <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/pushing-the-web-platform-forward/#2.-submit-your-idea\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Head on over to the <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">Web We Want website</a> and fill out the form. If you're interested in having your idea shared at a specific event, select that from the dropdown or select &quot;I'm not attending an event, but am open to my submission being shared at one.&quot;</p>\n<p>Once you've submitted, it may take a few days, but you'll get an email either letting you know if we need more information before we can post up the &quot;want&quot; on the website or a confirmation or rejection with more details.</p>\n<p>To avoid getting rejected, my biggest tip is this:</p>\n<p>Avoid broad and general complaints like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Fewer differences between browsers&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Just have great tools&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These don't focus on specific problem areas and we can't do a whole lot with it. I'll say we've had to reject very few of the items submitted. So thank you the web community for submitting what you have so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3.-leading-up-to-and-at-a-live-session\">3. Leading up to and at a live session <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/pushing-the-web-platform-forward/#3.-leading-up-to-and-at-a-live-session\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Depending on the number of submissions for an event session and who is running the event session, we'll assess the &quot;wants&quot; submitted and if the conference audience is the right audience for the &quot;wants&quot; submitted. Someone will reach out a week or two in advance of the event to see if you're coming to the event or will be able to provide a pre-recorded video presentation. We're looking for a presentation that is 3-5 minutes about the problem or feature gap you submitted.</p>\n<p>This is a great opportunity to dip your toes into public speaking if you've been thinking about it!</p>\n<p>At the event, the session has a few different components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A panel of 3 industry experts</li>\n<li>4-6 lightning presentations about each individual &quot;want&quot; that was selected</li>\n<li>Community voting and the judges' choice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've emceed a few of the sessions so far and it's been a blast. I introduce the session, our panel of industry experts and then we kick off the lightning presentations.</p>\n<p>In between each of the presentations, our panel of judges will discuss the problem or feature gap presented and offer their thoughts on each one. (There have been some great and thoughtful discussions that have occurred during the events so far.)</p>\n<p>At the end of the session, the judges deliberate to pick which of the problems or feature gaps they think is most pressing for browser vendors and/or standards bodies to work on.</p>\n<p>The session audience also gets a chance to vote on what they think is most pressing so we end up having a community winner and a judges' pick winner.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4.-after-the-event\">4. After the event <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/pushing-the-web-platform-forward/#4.-after-the-event\">#</a></h3>\n<p>After the event session, we take the two winning items back to the appropriate folks: browser vendors or standards groups. Some other work needs to take place before we do anything on the browser vendor side and that's where we're at now with the winning wants from last year.</p>\n<p>We're working to validate these problem spaces and gather more data before creating a backlog for our engineering teams. We're hoping that later this year we'll start to see some of these things be worked on by teams.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5.-i-submitted-something-and-it-didn't-win-or-it-didn't-get-presented%2C-now-what%3F\">5. I submitted something and it didn't win or it didn't get presented, now what? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/pushing-the-web-platform-forward/#5.-i-submitted-something-and-it-didn't-win-or-it-didn't-get-presented%2C-now-what%3F\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If you're incredibly keen to present and will be at one of our upcoming events but didn't specify that event, please reach out to me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Twitter</a> or shoot me an <a href=\"mailto:steph.stimac@gmail.com\">email</a>.</p>\n<p>If you presented your idea and it didn't win, that's still okay! Aaron setup a voting mechanism on the website so folks are able to upvote the items that are most important to them. We'll be keeping a close eye on this overtime to track those upvotes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-the-web-platform\">The Future of the Web Platform <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/pushing-the-web-platform-forward/#the-future-of-the-web-platform\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I've been on the browser team nearly 4 years already and I've slowly gotten involved with working with web community. I can only speak for what I've seen on the Edge team, but with our work on adopting Chromium over the last year, we have become so much more focused on feedback from the community.</p>\n<p>The beautiful thing about The Web We Want is that it's a cross-browser and standards group effort. This is a collective effort by the folks who build the browser to listen to where those who build for the web think we should be focusing our time.</p>\n<p>And if you're thinking, I want to be more involved though! <a href=\"https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2019/05/07/getting-involved-with-the-web-platform/\">Rachel Andrew</a> has a great source for getting involved with the web platform. There are so many different ways to get involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-you-host-a-meetup-or-a-conference%3F\">Do you host a meetup or a conference? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/pushing-the-web-platform-forward/#do-you-host-a-meetup-or-a-conference%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One final note, if you run a conference or a meetup and are interested in running this community focused session, please <a href=\"mailto:steph.stimac@gmail.com\">reach out</a>! We'd be happy to see how we can support running The Web We Want in more locations.</p>",

    "title": "Inspiring high school students with HTML and CSS",
    "partialText": "<p>Nearly a year ago I reached out to my high school across the state about coming in and giving a talk about careers in tech. Due to conflicting schedules I had to reschedule a few times and after a few crazy months of travel to end my 2019, I finally got the trip on the calendar and headed over in January.</p>\n<h2 id=\"being-visible-as-a-woman-in-tech\">Being visible as a woman in tech <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/inspiring-high-school-students-tech/#being-visible-as-a-woman-in-tech\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A few people wondered why I wanted to go talk to a bunch of high schoolers about what I do. For me, it is incredibly important to show up as a woman and talk about my path into tech, especially for any of the girls in the room. I felt it was important to let them know there isn't one singular path into tech and that a computer science degree isn't always necessary depending on what they want to do.</p>\n<p>I was so lost as a high school student when it came to figuring out what I wanted to do. I stumbled into a graphic design career because it was clear I wasn't cut out for a fashion design career.  I'm so incredibly thankful I didn't go down that fashion design path. Who knows what would have happened but I'm so happy I'm doing what I do today. Rejection is redirection.</p>\n<p>I remember we had a few career fairs and I never saw anyone that I could relate to. It was one of the high school art teachers who was quirky but stylish who helped me figure out my way into a design degree and I'm so incredibly grateful for her.</p>\n<p>I wanted to be that for the students, but especially for the girls. Boys have so many visible role models, especially in tech.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rediscovering-magic-in-html-%26-css\">Rediscovering magic in HTML &amp; CSS <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/inspiring-high-school-students-tech/#rediscovering-magic-in-html-%26-css\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The talk I gave focused on 4 different career paths at Microsoft that I have experience with: Program Management, Software Engineer, UX Engineer and Developer Advocate, and then I showed a list of about 30 other titles for jobs at Microsoft to highlight just how diverse roles are. There's some cool stuff to work on at Microsoft!</p>\n<p>I got ready to show some cool code examples of things I'd found on the internet, but the students asked to see some of my code. I was somewhat taken aback and decided to pull up my Codepen and showed this bit of HTML and CSS I had been working on to try and figure out how <code>:nth-child(Xn+X)</code> works:</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1rem 0;\">\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"400\" data-theme-id=\"default\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"seaotta\" data-slug-hash=\"QWwrezg\" style=\"height: 400px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"Repeating CSS Shapes\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/seaotta/pen/QWwrezg\">\n  Repeating CSS Shapes</a> by Stephanie Stimac 🌙  (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/seaotta\">@seaotta</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p>I started changing the numbers around in real-time and the shapes started to readjust their rotation. There was excited murmuring from the class.</p>\n<p>I decided to pull up my website and said out loud that I could show them my website and this is perhaps the highlight of the entire class for me.</p>\n<p>&quot;<em>Your</em> website? You have a website?&quot; Someone said.</p>\n<p>And I was somewhat baffled by the question, &quot;Yes, it's my website.&quot; Not quite realizing they didn't know you could buy a URL and code up a website. I'd clearly forgotten what it was like to be their age.</p>\n<p>So I pulled up my website and asked if any of them knew what the browser developer tools were and no one did. So I explained how on any website they visit, they could right click, find &quot;Inspect&quot; and click on that and view the code for a website.</p>\n<p>I opened the DevTools on my site and there was an audible gasp from the class and excited murmuring.</p>\n<p>&quot;That's your code?&quot; A student asked.<br />\n&quot;Yes, that's all my code!&quot;<br />\n&quot;You wrote all of that?!&quot;<br />\n&quot;Yes, it's my website.&quot;</p>\n<p>And the class kind of exploded and starting talking amongst themselves. I was floored and my perspective readjusted.</p>\n<p>When I code, it's usually in HTML and CSS, and I suppose there's a part of me that feels like that isn't special because some tech bros decide to be vocal and loud about HTML and CSS not being special nearly everyday (it is special and tech bros can shut up.)</p>\n<p>And the response from that class of high school students delighted me and grounded me in a way I haven't experienced before. What I view as a simple code was absolute magic to them. And for all of us who code, I think we forget it is magic. Computational magic but still magic. HTML and CSS <em>are</em> magic.</p>\n<p>I wasn't expecting a class of high school students to be inspired or bedazzled by my portfolio website, which is nothing fancy. There's no JavaScript. There's a few CSS Animations. But it delivers information quickly and effectively. It serves its purpose.</p>\n<p>There's a lesson about progressive enhancement and even performance in here somewhere but that's not the point of this post.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-we-inspire-a-new-generation-of-builders-for-the-web%3F\">How do we inspire a new generation of builders for the web? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/01/inspiring-high-school-students-tech/#how-do-we-inspire-a-new-generation-of-builders-for-the-web%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There's an entirely new generation of teenagers out there starting to explore the possibility of working on the web. I was able to dabble in HTML and CSS on LiveJournal and MySpace to tweak layouts and colors and customize things to represent me. Today, I can't customize Facebook or Twitter or Instagram with code. Platforms are much more closed.</p>\n<p>There are a million blogging platforms with customization options ranging from closed to complete control. Is there a middle ground? Is there somewhere on the web that offers an experience like I had with MySpace and LiveJournal, that others had with Neopets?</p>\n<p>I'm not even sure. It's hard to put myself back in the shoes of a 14 or 15 year old.</p>\n<p>What I do know is that I would be much more intimidated today if I were that age trying to get into the web. With the amount of knowledge and access at my fingertips, I would be discouraged if I saw all the negative comments about HTML and CSS not being useful.</p>\n<p>HTML and CSS are the foundation for the web. Even in it's most plain form without CSS, HTML can deliver information to those with internet access across the planet. That is powerful and we in our tech bubble should try our best to not forget that.</p>",

    "title": "Why SmashingConf SF 2019 will always hold a special spot in my heart",
    "partialText": "<p>I find my perception of time to mind-boggling sometimes. Today is the 15th of April 2020 and when I look back at the last year, I look at how much has changed in my professional and personal life. It feels like yesterday and forever ago. I did not think I would be in this spot today, regardless of a pandemic raging or not, and I can pinpoint the exact start of this change in my life to the 15th of April 2019.</p>\n<h2 id=\"smashingconf-sf-2019\">SmashingConf SF 2019 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/04/smashing-sf-2019/#smashingconf-sf-2019\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I was headed down to San Francisco for Smashing SF on the 15th since Microsoft Edge was an event sponsor. I was supposed to go to the speaker dinner the night before the conference with my friend and colleague Colleen Williams but something in her schedule changed and I was going to be the only representative from the team.</p>\n<p>I was an absolute wreck. I of course knew who a number of the speakers were but I usually attended the conferences with a colleague who was much more connected and could make introductions so I had to psyche myself up a bit before the dinner. I was going to be in a room with people I deeply respected but didn’t really know personally.</p>\n<p>I arrived at the venue and sat off to the side, too intimidated to go approach a few of the speakers who were also waiting. I knew who they were and I’d been introduced before but I have this habit of presuming to think that no one remembers me.</p>\n<p>So I waited until we were gathered by the hosts and ushered up to the spot we were having dinner, grabbed a glass of wine and started chatting with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ksylor\">Katie Sylor-Miller</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/malchata\">Jeremy Wagner</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steveschoger\">Steve Schoger</a> about speaking at conferences and I learned something.</p>\n<p>Most people get nervous about speaking. If you don’t, that’s probably not a good thing. They encouraged me to submit a CFP I had been thinking about because I had a deeply personal story around the theme for the conference.</p>\n<p>I ended up submitting that CFP after that evening. I was accepted a week and a half later to the conference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"outside-my-comfort-zone\">Outside my comfort zone <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/04/smashing-sf-2019/#outside-my-comfort-zone\">#</a></h2>\n<p>That kicked off a whole round of things that simultaneously helped improve my anxiety and gave me more confidence as a whole. I took a mindfulness course at work. At JSConf EU I hopped up and gave a quick lightning talk about <a href=\"https://webhint.io/\">webhint</a>, something I never would have done before.</p>\n<p>And then I started to help drive <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">The Web We Want</a> initiative with my colleague Aaron. This led to my first time on stage at An Event Apart a month and a half before my conference talk. I was pushing myself out of my comfort-zone.</p>\n<p>And suddenly September arrived and I was in Scotland giving my talk, and then Amsterdam running the Web We Want, and then I was in New York for SmashingConf NYC running the Web We Want again. And this time, I went to the speaker dinner a little bit early and stood with Amanda, one of the SmashingConf crew members, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelandrew\">Rachel Andrew</a> and chatted. I was not sat in the corner timidly. And at the end of the conference, I walked 10 blocks in the pouring rain to go to the after conference speaker party. Something I would not have done 7 months previously.</p>\n<p>Ironically, or maybe not, my trip to NYC for SmashingConf further confirmed the shift in my life  and validated I was on the right path. It’s lonely at times, working through such a personal and private upheaval of my life but I’ve come to find I have support and love in places I didn’t even know I did. For the first time in a long time, I’m focusing on me and who I am because part of that upheaval was realizing I didn’t know.</p>\n<p>I am deeply in love with what I get to do and the most surprising of all, I love to speak at conferences. This is a girl who switched to a different university English class because the one she enrolled in had involved a lengthy presentation as a final and that horrified me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-15th-of-april-2019\">The 15th of April 2019 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/04/smashing-sf-2019/#the-15th-of-april-2019\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So here I am a year later, astounded it’s been a year. Astounded and proud of the change I’ve gone through. I went from being nervous about the thought of submitting a CFP to reaching out to conferences that didn’t have an open CFP and being accepted to speak. And even though everything is on hold and postponed at the moment, I can’t wait to interact with folks in the web community in person again. I can't wait to get up on stage and speak.</p>\n<p>And all of this stemmed from what began as an anxiety-ridden evening with lovely humans encouraging me to go for it. And because of that, the 15th of April 2019 and SmashingConf SF will always hold an extremely special place in my heart.</p>",

    "title": "The Web We Want Survey Results",
    "partialText": "<p class=\"blog-post__date\">14 May 2020</p>\n<p>At the end of July 2019, we kicked off our first live Web We Want session. At the start, we only had a handful of submissions and one person willing to record their lightning talk for the session we ran at An Event Apart D.C. We've come quite a ways since then with over 250 submissions to the website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Myself</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson\">Aaron Gustafson</a> have run 5 sessions at conferences and successfully onboarded community members to run an additional 3 sessions at events themselves, resulting in 8 sessions between July 2019 and February 2020.</p>\n<p>To start diving into the various Wants that have been submitted, the Web We Want team is initially focusing on the 12 winning Wants from the 6 events that were run last year to start to dig into which of them are the most important problems or areas we should focus on.</p>\n<p>Since the Wants fall into different areas and teams, the surveys were divided into three categories: DevTools, HTML/CSS/Layout, and General Browser for more miscellaneous/broader requests.</p>\n<p>Each survey asked the following questions for each want:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being &quot;not useful at all&quot;, and 10 be &quot;extremely useful&quot;, rate each want on how useful you think it is.</li>\n<li>Please rank each want from your favorite to least favorite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few things to note here:</p>\n<p>I started to include a question about the types of roles people consider themselves to be in after the first survey. This can (maybe) help provide more insight into why certain things I was expecting to rank highly, didn't. So that information is missing from the first survey about developer tooling wants.</p>\n<p>For the scale of “not useful at all” to “extremely useful”, this formula uses an NPS or Net Promoter Score, which is usually used to help gauge customer loyalty but in this context is more focused on customer attitudes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"devtools-survey-results\">DevTools Survey Results <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/05/web-we-want-2019-survey-results/#devtools-survey-results\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There were 60 respondents to the DevTools survey and these were the 4 Wants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/60/\">I want to be able to save/load debugger state</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/79/\">I want improved behavior of browser emulators to match interaction on mobile devices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/12/\">I want accessibility tools front &amp; center</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/64/\">I want a source order viewer for rearranged content</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"scoring-how-useful-each-submission-would-be\">Scoring how useful each submission would be <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/05/web-we-want-2019-survey-results/#scoring-how-useful-each-submission-would-be\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It would be useful if Browser DevTools put accessibility tooling in a more prominent and easily findable location.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/survey-results/DevTools/more-prominent-a11y-tooling.png\" alt=\"alt: NPS Score for prominent accessibility tooling: 12.\" /></p>\n<p>It would be useful if Browser DevTools were able to save the current debugger state to a file in order to load and restore the file back into the DevTools to start debugging from the same place.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/survey-results/DevTools/save-current-debugger-state.png\" alt=\"alt: NPS Score for saving the current debugger state: -38.\" /></p>\n<p>It would be useful if the Browser DevTools had a source order viewer built in to identify rearranged content that would cause accessibility problems for screen readers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/survey-results/DevTools/source-order-viewer.png\" alt=\"alt: NPS Score: for saving a source order viewer: -18.\" /></p>\n<p>It would be useful if Browser emulators did a better job of emulating interaction on mobile devices.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/survey-results/DevTools/browser-emulators.png\" alt=\"alt: NPS Score for better browser emulators for mobile devices: 35.\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"please-rank-each-of-the-items-from-favorite-to-least-favorite.\">Please rank each of the items from favorite to least favorite. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/05/web-we-want-2019-survey-results/#please-rank-each-of-the-items-from-favorite-to-least-favorite.\">#</a></h3>\n<p>These were the results, in order of ranking:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I want accessibility tools front &amp; center<br />\n1st choice: 48.3%<br />\n2nd choice: 21.7%<br />\n3rd choice: 20%<br />\n4th choice: 10%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I want improved behavior of browser emulators to match interaction on mobile devices<br />\n1st choice: 36.7%<br />\n2nd choice: 35%<br />\n3rd choice: 18.3%<br />\n4th choice: 10%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I want a source order viewer for rearranged content<br />\n1st choice: 1.6%<br />\n2nd choice: 30%<br />\n3rd choice: 36.7%<br />\n4th choice: 31.7%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I want to be able to save/load debugger state<br />\n1st choice: 13.3%<br />\n2nd choice: 13.3%<br />\n3rd choice: 25%<br />\n4th choice: 48.4%</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/survey-results/DevTools/rank-devtools.png\" alt=\"alt: Visual representation of the ranked wants\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"notable-verbatims\">Notable Verbatims <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/05/web-we-want-2019-survey-results/#notable-verbatims\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A few quotes from survey takers that I thought were worth calling out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would be great if all emulation were in the same place.

Generally DevTools features can be easier to prototype and test and start getting feedback on, but when it comes to web platform features, things are going to take longer especially if standards groups have to be involved.</p>\n<p>Recently, I’ve been involved in conversations with team members working on other browsers, as has my co-worker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson\">Aaron</a>, about the Web We Want and how we integrate the submissions with other signals from the web community. We're still smoothing out the process, so if you have feedback on how you'd like to see browsers work with the feedback, feel free to engage with us on <a href=\"https://github.com/WebWeWant/webwewant.fyi\">GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/webwewantfyi\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>The point I want to highlight here is we are working with other browser vendors to look over everything that has been submitted and are assessing whether it's something already being worked on by browsers, if it's something browsers could work on without standards groups, or if there are already proposals in standards groups that are in the works (here’s a great example of that in action over on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebWeWant/webwewant.fyi/issues/37\">Web We Want GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>A great example of something that's already being worked on is the HTML Controls submission (and there were actually a few other submissions on HTML Controls as well). There is a standards initiative called <a href=\"https://open-ui.org/\">Open UI</a> that's working toward making controls more customizable and extensible, starting with <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>. Even though this problem space is being worked on, the submissions here are still important as it provides additional evidence that browsers are working on fixing the right problems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-web-we-want-in-the-time-of-covid\">The Web We Want In The Time Of COVID <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/05/web-we-want-2019-survey-results/#the-web-we-want-in-the-time-of-covid\">#</a></h2>\n<p>For the moment, our in-person sessions are on hold, but we're looking into ways to keep the community engaged and active in this intiative so stay tuned for developments there.</p>\n<p>We're still taking submissions to the Web We Want, so if you have a problem or feature gap in the web platform, let us know and submit issues on the <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">Web We Want website</a> or <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/\">upvote submissions</a>. Issues are now being tracked in GitHub in an attempt to allow more engagement and discussion from the community and browser and standards folks. There is no want too small or too big, so let us know and help to move the web platform forward!</p>",

I came up with this post earlier this week while I struggled to finish a rather long post summarizing the survey results from a project I co-lead called <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">The Web We Want</a>.</p>\n<p>On the same day I decided to start video blogging tech thoughts, purposefully titled Tech Thots, while I jotted down other ideas for work content.</p>\n<p>I am overflowing with ideas while simultaneously too exhausted to bring them all to fruition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lost-moments\">Lost Moments <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/05/creativity-covid/#lost-moments\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The weight of sadness over lost events and experiences is heavy.</p>\n<p>I spoke at my first tech event of the year, SFHTML5, at the end of February, where my Uber driver teased me about the cough I'd had since January: &quot;It's not that corona is it?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;No, just asthma.&quot; I said at the time. But my cough didn't go away until April and I'm left wondering when I think about my symptoms in January, did I have it?</p>\n<p>Then the next week, I flew to the UK, to squeeze in a talk at FrontEnd NE. My manager left it up to me if I wanted to travel as talk of COVID spreading hit the news.</p>\n<p>I got out the door a day before Microsoft put a non-essential travel ban into effect and spent 6 days in the UK. I gave a talk in Newcastle, I went to Leeds for another event and to see a friend, spent an evening in London wandering around in the cold, visiting spots I wanted to despite being tired, thinking I would for sure be back in May. I booked my flight while sat in Heathrow in an unusually empty airline gate. And then I flew home.</p>\n<p>I flew home and I was supposed to be leaving for New Zealand not long after. I pulled out of that event. And then my trip back to San Francisco for another SFHTML5 session got postponed. As did each and every work and personal trip I was supposed to take.</p>\n<p>I was supposed to be traveling every other week from March to the end of May. I was supposed to spend a week in Arizona with my parents for my mom's birthday. I was supposed to go to Washington D.C. to watch my brother graduate from medical school. MEDICAL SCHOOL. Instead, he graduated medical school alone, <a href=\"https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/05/i-graduated-medical-school-while-sitting-in-the-parking-lot.html\">sitting in a parking lot of a grocery store</a>.</p>\n<p>By now, I'd have given 5 conference talks and led 2 Web We Want sessions. If I was posting this next week, I'd have given 6 talks.</p>\n<p>I am sad, and most importantly, I'm allowed to be sad, to mourn the lost time. We all are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-paradox-of-imagination-and-burnout\">A Paradox of Imagination and Burnout <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/05/creativity-covid/#a-paradox-of-imagination-and-burnout\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I'm not sure burnout is the right word. I know what burnout feels like and what I'm feeling due to no face-to-face interaction with my co-workers since February is not burnout. But I am exhausted. The weight of a never-ending news cycle coupled with a petulant, narcissistic child within the highest office in the United States is heavy.</p>\n<p>I have weeks where I feel completely useless and my focus isn't there. I make my way through tasks but I notice how distracted I am. A heavy weight. I notice how distracted I am, I acknowledge the world but I am still so hard on myself, as I've always been.</p>\n<p>I am distracted but I find myself brainstorming new ideas.</p>\n<p>How do I evolve <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">The Web We Want</a> when I can't host a session at a conference? How do I engage with the web developer community? What about...? And what if...?</p>\n<p>And suddenly I'm writing down ideas for videos and blog posts and content I would not have otherwise thought about had I not been in this situation. I'm writing them down but the heaviness is there, omnipresent.</p>\n<p>Everything takes longer to do right now but somewhat ironically I'm feeling more creative than ever despite that constant heaviness of an infinite present.</p>\n<h2 id=\"light-at-the-end-of-tunnel-whose-length-i-don't-know\">Light at the end of tunnel whose length I don't know <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/05/creativity-covid/#light-at-the-end-of-tunnel-whose-length-i-don't-know\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Tech has been a saving grace in all of this.</p>\n<p>No, Zoom isn't the same as hugging my friends and dancing with them. A Skype date isn't the same as meeting face to face. DJs livestreaming while everyone joins a Google Meet room and livestreams themselves dancing is not the same as a festival. But it's something.</p>\n<p>Connection while in isolation.</p>\n<p>I have a vague idea of when I'll be able to travel again, with the intention of staying put in that place for a few weeks but that timeline is not necessarily guaranteed. The first time I get on a plane, it will not be with the intention of a quick trip like a conference. I know why I'll be flying and my heart is elated.</p>\n<p>And the universe continues to baffle me because if it wasn't for quarantine, there are conversations that wouldn't have evolved, connections that would not have happened and there are plans that wouldn't have been made.</p>\n<p>Remember in my recap of 2019, how I stated that life doesn't always turn out the way you plan? I've embraced the unexpected. Per usual, I didn't know what I was hoping to find but what I've found in quarantine is something I never expected: a slice of pure joy in an otherwise unhappy time.</p>\n<p>What I've found isn't necessarily &quot;normal&quot;, whatever that means. What is normal?</p>\n<p>There is no normal.</p>\n<p>And if there was, we shouldn't go back to it. I won't be and what works for me may not work for others.</p>\n<p>I did not go back to the UK in May.</p>\n<p>But let me vague-post and say, I think I'll get my fill and more than I ever hoped for in visits to the UK because of quarantine. A light at the end of a very long tunnel.</p>\n<p>It's something positive and that's what I'm clinging to, to counteract the weight of time standing still and months lost to COVID quarantine.</p>",

    "title": "Browser font rendering inconsistencies",
    "partialText": "<p class=\"blog-post__date\">22 June 2020</p>\n<p>I was working on a project that required me pulling up the developer tools in different browsers against my personal website when I opened up Safari and noticed how drastically different the title of my page was rendering. It was extremely bold in Safari compared to the other browsers.</p>\n<p>Much more bold than I expected it to be.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/browser-fonts/browser-fonts.png\" alt=\"alt: Font rendering in, from top to bottom, Safari. Edge and Firefox\" /></p>\n<p>I looked at my stylesheet and saw that I had applied minimal styling to my headings and recall a decision to just let the browser handle the heading styles apart from defining the <code>font-family</code> and <code>font-sizes</code>. So the difference in weight was be caused by the browser.</p>\n<p><code>h1</code> tags are bold by default but there appears to be extra bold being applied by Safari.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpamental\">Jason Pamental</a> suggested using <code>font-synthesis: none;</code> but that didn't have any effect in Safari or Firefox (it's not supported in other browsers at the moment.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"computed-styles\">Computed Styles <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/06/browser-fonts/#computed-styles\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I started to dissect differences between the user agent style sheet and the Computed Styles tab in the DevTools.</p>\n<p>Safari User agent stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>h1 {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Safari computed CSS properties</p>\n<pre><code>h1 {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox user agent stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>h1 {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox computed CSS properties</p>\n<pre><code>h1 {\n  font-weight: 700;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the computed tab, Edge, Chrome and Firefox are all showing <code>font-weight: bold</code> to be computed to a font-weight of 700, whereas Safari's computed font-weight doesn't have a numerical value, it just remains computed as &quot;bold.&quot; But this still doesn't explain much.</p>\n<p>In fact somewhat ironically, Safari doesn't have <code>font-weight: 700</code> defined anywhere in stylesheets that I can see in the DevTools but it <em>is</em> rendering <code>h1</code>s in the 700 font-weight for the typeface Poppins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"browser-fallback-behavior\">Browser fallback behavior <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/06/browser-fonts/#browser-fallback-behavior\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So now I'm even more baffled and look to the line of code I have to define the font and font-weights I'm using.</p>\n<p><code>&lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:400,600&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;</code></p>\n<p>I don't know why, but I'm compelled to delete &quot;600&quot; from the string while in Edge. So I do and suddenly watch as the heading in Edge re-renders at &quot;400&quot;.</p>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>I add <code>,700</code> to the end of this string: <code>Poppins:400,600</code>. My heading re-renders and now matches Safari. I remove <code>,700</code> and it re-renders in the 600 font-weight. I delete 600 again, it re-renders in the 400 font-weight.</p>\n<p>I test this in Firefox and see the same results.</p>\n<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox all have a computed font-weight of 700 and if that particular font-weight isn't defined in the line of Google Fonts code, the browser grabs the next highest numerical font-weight that is defined and renders that font-weight as the bold weight. If you delete all font-weights from the Google Font code, you get the thinnest version of the font.</p>\n<p>So what happens when I test this in Safari? Absolutely nothing. It doesn't matter if I delete all the font-weights from the font link. Safari's headings remain bold. But then I noticed something interesting as well after deleting the 400,600 from the font code...my nav bar on my website didn't change either in Safari.</p>\n<p>So to confirm I was in fact seeing what I was seeing I changed the file on my live site and stripped 400,600 out so all I had was the following:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/browser-fonts/thin-heading.png\" alt=\"alt: Font rendering without any weight being defined\" /></p>\n<p>And Safari didn't change at all. I still had the CSS for my nav links declaring them at <code>font-weight: 600</code> and Safari was still pulling that weight despite me not defining it in the font code.</p>\n<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox had all fallen back to the thinnest font available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-do-i-do-to-render-headings-consistently-across-browsers-and-platforms%3F\">So what do I do to render headings consistently across browsers and platforms? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/06/browser-fonts/#so-what-do-i-do-to-render-headings-consistently-across-browsers-and-platforms%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This almost feels like a loaded question. This problem is almost akin (but a little bit less complex) to rendering HTML Forms consistently across platforms and browsers. The cross-platform problem is a harder one to solve as you can't control how the operating system handles font rendering.</p>\n<p>If you don't want the browser to decide how to bold font-weights then I suggest explicitly defining the font-weight with numerical values: 500, 600, etc to avoid Firefox, Edge and Chrome falling back to whatever the highest font-weight defined is.</p>\n<p>And a bit of a disclaimer: I've only looked at <code>h1</code> rendering for this article. I suspect there are many other areas one could dive into to compare other headings and paragraph rendering.</p>\n<p>And the final question you may be wondering is this:</p>\n<p>Which way is actually right? Firefox/Edge/Chrome or Safari?</p>\n<p>And my answer is: I don't actually know.</p>\n<p>Multiple browsers behaving the same isn't necessarily indicative of the correct implementation so I suspect I will be trying to dive into browser behavior to figure out the correct implementation at a later date.</p>",

I'd love to see the situation improved to bring feature parity. That said, there are real concerns about shortcut handling here. At minimum, this should only be allowed for installed apps, it should be limited to using some well-known shortcut prefix (CTRL, Shift, Option, Windows key, etc.).&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Enhanced keyboard accessibility. As alluded to in the proposal, privacy concerns would need to be addressed&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I see it useful but also the security risks are great. If it's implemented then protections should be put in place i.e. if there's a form with a password field (&amp;lt;input type=password ) or some other known identifier than the feature should be disabled. As for OS wide, well not sure how you protect against that. That said, it isn't hard to write an app which logs keystrokes and embedded it within a program.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;would cut down on cross-OS boilerplate for things like copy paste close save etc.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;This brings the web closer to native app parity. It sounds like a Fugu API&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Web apps are moving to touch and click interfaces, not to keyboard interactions&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Would make it a lot easier to develop web apps as you'll not need to write code to recognize shortcuts for different operating systems&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;we currently have our own hand rolled solution which works well but it's difficult to manage which shortcuts are active and when given the different elements that pop up on screen at different times. Particularly when the event listeners need to attach to window and not the DOM node that they belong to.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;A neat idea, but can be easily abused. For example, it could also enable online keyloggers that don't require installing malware, making it extremely difficult for anti-virus software to detect.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Allows us to develop enterprise-grade PWAs that work well in desktop environments&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I'm concerned about security, but global keyboard listeners would be extremely helpful for productivity and professional software. All the Ops teams I've worked with, for instance, have to switch between multiple web apps and dashboards, and alt-tabbing is the most efficient way to do that. If they were able to set up shortcuts for commons tasks, that would be a game changer.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When reviewing the 'reason for ratings' responses, there does seem to be a desire for this feature but there are clear concerns about privacy and ensuring a feature like this wouldn't be abused.

    "title": "What the heck is an Origin Trial?",
    "partialText": "<p class=\"blog-post__date\">28 October 2020</p>\n<p>My role of the Edge Developer Experiences Ecosystem team tends to revolve around gathering developer feedback. I run an initative called <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">The Web We Want</a>, I setup a new UserVoice page for Edge specific feedback (which I won't link to as it's being deprecated and replaced), and I pay attention to what gets tweeted to me and make sure to tag the right folks so that feedback gets filed. Nevermind all the other places I'm looking: in Standards group forums, Slack groups, blog comments.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of places to leave feedback, and when I think about the type of feedback I'm focused on gathering, it's about things that don't have an implementation or solution yet.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to browser Origin Trials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what's-a-browser-origin-trial%3F\">What's a browser Origin Trial? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/10/what-the-heck-origin-trials/#what's-a-browser-origin-trial%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Origin Trials are a way for developers to test and use experimental web platform features for a limited amount of time in exchange for feedback. Feedback is key in origin trials as browsers are granting developers access to ensure that the feature makes sense and is usable. It's an iterative and open process and allows the engineers building the platform feature a chance to incorporate feedback and make changes to the feature.</p>\n<p>So often in the past, web platform features were developed without input and this offers developers anywhere a chance to try out some new bleeding edge web tech and provide feedback on how it works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-an-origin-trial%3F\">How do I use an Origin Trial? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/10/what-the-heck-origin-trials/#how-do-i-use-an-origin-trial%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/\">Microsoft Edge</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.chrome.com/origintrials/#/trials/active\">Google Chrome</a> both offer Origin Trials for developers.</p>\n<p>At this particular moment you might be thinking, wait, Edge and Chrome both have Origin Trials? Aren't they both Chromium browsers? Will the Origin Trials be the same?</p>\n<p>And the answers to that are yes, yes, and no.</p>\n<p>The Origin Trial program launched back in May during Build for Microsoft Edge and we have platform features, like web primitives for dual screen devices, that our team would be working on and not Chrome. So the sets are different.</p>\n<h3 id=\"origin-trial-process\">Origin Trial Process <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/10/what-the-heck-origin-trials/#origin-trial-process\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To get started developers should find an Origin Trial they're interested in experimenting with and register for it. You'll register the origin you want to use the experimental feature on and you'll be issued a token.</p>\n<p>You'll then have to add some code to your website one of two ways to use the token provided to you.</p>\n<p>Option 1: Using a <meta /> Tag</p>\n<p><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;origin-trial&quot; content=&quot;your-token-gues-here&quot;&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Option 2: Add Origin-Trial to your HTTP server response headers, example:</p>\n<p><code>Origin-Trial: your-token-goes-here</code></p>\n<p>And that will activate your origin trial. There are some more guidelines about allowed origins, subdomains, URL paths and query params in the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/\">Edge Origin Trial Documentation</a> as well as a walkthrough on how to register or unregister an origin trial. Chrome also has a <a href=\"https://web.dev/origin-trials/\">getting started guide</a> for their origin trials though the process should be the same.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submitting-feedback-and-trial-expiration\">Submitting feedback and trial expiration <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/10/what-the-heck-origin-trials/#submitting-feedback-and-trial-expiration\">#</a></h3>\n<p>At their core, origin trials are provided so developers can try out new APIs before they are shipped and provide feedback about the experience of using the API and browser vendors can then assess and incorporate that feedback if they decide to do so.</p>\n<p>These features are not necessarily complete when they're in an origin trial and may or may not be available in other browsers so trials are time-boxed to 6 weeks for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If developers would like to continue to utlize the trial they have to provide feedback at the end of the 6 weeks. Again, feedback is key so renewal of the origin trial is based on providing feedback.</li>\n<li>This prevents developers from baking is not complete or may need to be revised heavily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if an origin trial is successful, the API will have a period between the end of the origin trial and the feature landing where it will not be available to developers. Most likely there will be improvements to be made before the feature lands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"provide-a-fallback\">Provide a fallback <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/10/what-the-heck-origin-trials/#provide-a-fallback\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Origin trials offer a chance to use some cutting edge web platform technology on your website, because of the nature of this kind of tech, the feature may or may not be available in other browsers so always provide a fallback so that your experience doesn't break for your customers who may be using different browsers.</p>\n<p>You should provide a fallback anyway due to the limited duration of an origin trial. Maybe you try out a feature and realize it's not what you need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-edge-of-the-web-(no-pun-intended)\">The edge of the web (no pun intended) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/10/what-the-heck-origin-trials/#the-edge-of-the-web-(no-pun-intended)\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Origin trials provide a unique opportunity to flip on an experimental feature for all the visitor's to an origin. No one has to turn on any experimental flags to get a feature to work, it just <em>works</em> (again, for a limited time). And it provides a chance for developers to provide critical feedback to API authors.</p>\n<p>As I've immersed myself further into the world of the web platform, one constant I seem to hear is that developers want to know what browser vendors / API authors are doing. They don't want these things developed behind closed doors and they want to be able to provide feedback.</p>\n<p>Well that moment is here. There are a multitude of ways to get involved, but origin trials provide a very hands on way to do so.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'd want to go try out the <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/origin-trials/dual-screen-and-foldable-devices-css-and/registration/\">dual-screen and foldable device primitives</a> available in Edge. As someone with a background in design, the idea of getting to tinker with these CSS and JavaScript primitives to provide an enhanced experience for those on dual-screen devices is exciting.</p>\n<p>So go explore! See if there's something experimental Chrome or Edge is working on that you can use and give it a whirl. Be involved in moving the platform forward with us.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p class=\"blog-post__date\">15 December 2020</p>\n<p>I was sat in Heathrow at the end of January, riding an unimaginable professional high. I'd just spent a few days in Nottingham for New Adventures Conf before escaping to Leeds to saddle myself with a hangover that lasted 3 days(Oh Leeds) after which I spent an evening in London. While in London, I got news a talk for a conference that didn't have an open CFP was accepted.</p>\n<p>I had reached out rather nervously, being new to this whole public speaking space, to pitch a talk on dual screen devices. The event was to be in Prague in September.</p>\n<p>I counted up all the travel, personal and conference-wise that 2020 had in store for me while sat at my gate in Heathrow: Latvia. New Zealand. Germany. England...multiple times. Scotland. Washington DC. NYC. San Francisco. Czech Republic. Canada. Phoenix. A few others I've forgotten now.</p>\n<p>I escaped to Newcastle for Frontend NE at the start of March right as a Microsoft travel ban went into place and when I returned home it was straight into work from home because of COVID.</p>\n<p>Everything on my list was postponed or cancelled. Not just my talks but all my <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">Web We Want</a> sessions too.</p>\n<p>My brother's graduation from med school was cancelled. I was supposed to go to the Scottish Highlands on a remote little soul-finding retreat for myself...obviously cancelled (well, postponed). Bass Coast Festival in July was cancelled.</p>\n<p>&quot;This was supposed to be my year!&quot; I lamented to my therapist in May. &quot;But it is your year.&quot; And she proceeded to list off a few deeply personal emotional accomplishments.</p>\n<p>&quot;You're right.&quot; And I reframed my year around those things, thinking those would be the only things I accomplished this year. Mourned for the things I would not experience this year and moved on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"all-the-things-i-did-in-2020\">All the things I did in 2020 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2020/12/everything-i-wanted/#all-the-things-i-did-in-2020\">#</a></h2>\n<p>But I have so many things I did accomplish this year professionally to be proud of.</p>\n<p>I'm published in <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/building-the-web-we-want/\">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/standardizing-select-native-html-form-controls/\">Smashing Magazine</a>.<br />\nI've been invited to record 6 podcasts.<br />\nI've given 7 talks.<br />\nI was invited to speak at 3 events that weren't on the original calendar.</p>\n<p>And finally: I was asked to write a book on design and development.</p>\n<p>Lots of work awaits me in 2021. I'm extremely excited.</p>\n<p>On a more personal note, this year I moved house, had some big personal things finalized, and dealt with a family member who was diagnosed with cancer (everything's now fine a few months after surgery). The weight of the year and all this came crashing down in August, and let me tell you, it's extremely cathartic to sit out in nature and cry for 3 hours. Fuck you 2020.</p>\n<p>I look at the person I was a year ago. The choices I made, the things I was doing, how I felt. I am not the same person I was a year ago. I'm more whole. More confident. More open. More thoughtful. More protective of my needs and my energy.</p>\n<p>I have an adventure ahead of me both personally and professionally. There's a start of a plan in place for some things that make me incredibly happy. January 2020 me wasn't happy. December 2020 me is. And I think that's the last thing I was expecting to feel at the end of this year.</p>\n<p>Steph</p>",

Pandemic life, writing a book on design for developers, and everything else that comes with existing right now has me worn out. When I've got free time, it's usually running off to go bike, get outside or see friends.</p>\n<p>I've felt a bit disconnected though from myself and the learning/sharing aspect I so enjoy about the web community I'm apart of. Sharing on Twitter doesn't quite scratch that itch though as it gets lost in the noise, a tweet quickly swept away by all the other tweets. I love what my friend <a href=\"https://melanie-richards.com/\">Melanie Richards</a> does on her blog with her <a href=\"https://melanie-richards.com/blog\">learning logs</a>.</p>\n<p>Will I get to it weekly?

    "title": "20 Months",
    "partialText": "<p class=\"blog-post__date\">27 October 2021</p>\n<p>It has been 20 months since I last stood in front of a group of people and delivered a talk.</p>\n<p>What I find even more cruel is that I have given more talks to my webcam than I have in person now. I'm on my way to London for <a href=\"https://2021.stateofthebrowser.com/\">State of the Browser</a>. The last time I gave a talk, I was in front of a group in Newcastle Upon Tyne, delivering the first iteration of the talk I'll be giving. It's hardly the same talk as quite a bit has happened since March 2020.</p>\n<p>That was only my 4th time giving a talk, when I was in Newcastle.</p>\n<p>This will be the 19th.</p>\n<p>I'm not riddled with anxiety like I was with my first talk. The nerves will pop up the evening before and the day of the event, which is normal. I've been told no nerves is generally not a good sign. Having nerves, in my opinion, is respecting the process...everything that goes into making an event happen.</p>\n<p>But I'm reminded how far I've come. I staunchly swore, up and down and side to side that I would never, ever give a talk. Public speaking wasn't for me. I once pulled out of a co-presentation because I had a panic attack over it. There were some other outside reasons that culminated in that panic attack, but I digress. It's also heartening to know that others have seen how far I've come.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/20-months/kyle-tweet.png\" alt=\"alt: A Tweet from @kylealden that reads, &quot;just travel back in time to 2017 @seaotta to let her know that speaking at a big event will some day be the easy part&quot;\" /></p>\n<p>I've found myself with an abundance of time-sensitive deliverables the past few weeks...which I find uber stressful (on top of dealing with poor mental health because we are still in a pandemic and I am still working from home alone). And yet this event, which came to me a few days into October, has done nothing but excite me and keep me going.</p>\n<p>I don't know when the next in-person event I'll get to speak at will be. Spring 2022? Nothing's confirmed right now and as of right now, this is my last talk of the year. (But that'll probably change. <a href=\"mailto:steph.stimac@gmail.com\">Get in touch</a> if you're running an event, virtual or in-person.)</p>\n<p>All I do know is I have waited for this moment for a long time. For 20 months to be precise. 20 months that oddly feel like a decade and a blink of an eye. I get to share a stage with people I deeply respect and I get to see friends I haven't seen in person in a long while (or ever met in person, just know from Twitter...and Andy if you're reading this we're getting a dirty kebab.)</p>\n<p>I didn't fall in love with speaking in public. I fell in love with sharing knowledge and teaching developers.</p>\n<p>And I am so excited I get to restart this journey in London of all places. Let's go.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>It's almost a joke now, how I expect comments from men on my videos for work. When I go to check the comments, because I genuinely care about feedback or asks from developers, my heart sinks and my stomach drops when I see comments about my appearance or inquiries about my relationship status.</p>\n<p>I cope by screenshotting these comments and sending them to friends to have a laugh out of something that otherwise genuinely pisses me off.</p>\n<p>Commenting on my videos that I create FOR WORK with things like &quot;Do you have a boyfriend?&quot; or &quot;You're so beautiful&quot; is the equivalent of you stepping into my office to ask/tell me those things.</p>\n<p>It's the equivalent of you invading my professional space with personal commentary. And it's unwelcome.</p>\n<p>When I speak at conferences, it's because I enjoy speaking and teaching developers. Not to put myself out there to find a date.</p>\n<p>When I record videos for work, it's because I'm excited to share about what the team has been working on. Not to field questions about my relationship status.</p>\n<p>My appearance. My relationship status. My personal life. None of this has anything to do with what I do what I do for work. So stop asking in the comments on my work videos.</p>\n<p>The hardest part of all of this is when I get these comments, it reduces me to nothing more than my relationship status. Or my looks. I don't want to know that you think I'm good looking when I'm delivering a talk. I care about what you think about the technical content. I do not care about what you think about my appearance.</p>\n<p>My work life is not my dating life.</p>\n<p>As my friend Chris Wilson so eloquently put it:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I think that’s the problem; it’s not really a “rain fire down upon them” problem, but a “wtf is wrong with you that you’re confusing tech video comments with Tinder?” kinda problem.</p>&mdash; Chris Wilson (@cwilso) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cwilso/status/1460026355215581188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>I don't speak for all women. But I do know many of them in tech are tired about the comments on their appearance. The comments they get on their videos that have nothing to do with the content.</p>\n<p>We are more than our looks. We are more than our availability for a date.</p>\n<p>Stop leaving comments on our professional work reducing us to these things.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p class=\"blog-post__date\">11 March 2022</p>\n<p>Whoops. Here it is March already and I have not been keeping up with my Web Witch Grimoire posts. A lot of things have happened since October and I'm not even going to remotely attempt to recap it all.</p>\n<p>I've had a rough two and a half years. Not as rough as some, but rough for me. When I moved into my apartment in August 2020 I thought it was going to be the perfect setup for me and while it was good for what it was, a transition between an old life and a new life, it started to affect my mental health. It was in someone's basement after all and basements are dark and so is the PNW, especially in the winter.</p>\n<p>After a string of disappointing events I thought would make me feel better if they panned out, I took a good hard look at my life when they didn't and realized I had no backup plan for those disappointments and in realizing that, decided the thing within my control was my place of living and it was not bringing me joy so I changed it. I've always been an Eastsider, never in Seattle proper.</p>\n<p>If you're unfamiliar with the area, Seattle is surrounded by water and there is a lake that divides Seattle from Bellevue, to the east, and in trying to figure out my life realzied I needed a massive perspective change. I'm a Westsider now in an area that is 180 degrees from Bellevue and Redmond and so far I am incredibly happy. I feel a bit lighter. I'm back to trying to cook more, which is very hard when you're surrounded by a ton of amazing food. I'm within walking distance to bars and restaurants and I'm close to the water. I can't wait for summer and paddle board time.</p>\n<p>I'm still unpacking and trying to process everything that's going on in the world. It was surreal to focus on moving two weeks ago as everything in Ukraine began to unfold. And it's still surreal.</p>\n<p>Here's a <a href=\"https://how-to-help-ukraine-now.super.site/\">link to a bunch of ways to help Ukraine</a> if you're still trying to figure out what you can do.

I'll be relocating to Berlin in the autumn, and for now, I'm just trying to enjoy each and everyday and stay in the moment because time goes so fast, especially summer.</p>\n<p>I admittedly cried when I told my current manager I was leaving.

I'd not really listened to 80s music and I was in that awkward stage of moving on from the girl and boy bands I deemed childish at the time, searching for something more meaningful, more mature.</p>\n<p>The 80s music had stuck with me and I asked if he could recommend some music. &quot;Yeah, I'll bring you some stuff to start with.&quot; And he brought me some Depeche Mode cassette tapes.</p>\n<p>On the drive home one night, I popped <em>Music for the Masses</em> in to my car's cassette player and that was it. It was the end and the beginning.</p>\n<p>I was hooked. I bought every album I could. I'd even go on to buy vinyl despite not owning a record player. I just wanted everything Depeche Mode.</p>\n<p>When they released a new album and toured in 2005/2006, my dad picked me up from school early, drove us across the state to Seattle for the concert, then drove us back home so I could be in class the next morning.</p>\n<p>Then my brother started listening to them and we saw them in 2009 in Seattle.</p>\n<p>I missed them tour for Delta Machine. I can't remember why but I was bummed. Then they toured in 2017. My parents had never been to the UK or Europe, except for my dad who was born in Europe, and having finally gone in 2015 and fallen in love, I made a decision to surprise them and my brother with tickets in London. We hadn't taken a family vacation in years.</p>\n<p>My brother and I stood down on the floor of the stadium and he held an umbrella over my head while it rained. The walk to the Underground station took 45 minutes and when we finally got to the platform, the Central Line train wasn't coming. I got a call from my ex's mom asking if I was okay and I was confused. This was the night of terrorist attack on London Bridge. That's why the train wasn't running.</p>\n<p>We got on a different Underground line, carriage packed to the brim and got off near Trafalgar Square around 2:00 AM. We were the last ones out of the station.</p>\n<p>It was a memorable evening to say the least. A surreal dream: absolute joy at seeing my favorite band in another country, oddly scarred by the events that unfolded just a little bit further away in central London.  So surreal.</p>\n<p>The point I'm trying to get to is, Depeche Mode influenced me deeply. From my graphic design (I had mocked up Depeche Mode artwork for album covers for my initial portfolio to get into a design program), my style, even my music taste. Many of the electronic artists I now listen to, I've stumbled across Depeche Mode remixes they've done. It all felt very full circle.</p>\n<p>I am who I am today because of their influence. Without a question, they have always been my favorite band. Ever since that moment in high school. Their musical influence spans multiple areas of my life, some private, some public.</p>\n<p>I was telling my dad this past weekend, &quot;I need Depeche Mode to tour again!&quot; Hungry to see them again but wildly unsure when I would because of COVID.</p>\n<p>I always sort of wondered what this moment would be like, rather morbidly, telling myself, &quot;They are <em>old</em>, and there will come a time when there won't be another Depeche Mode concert to go to.&quot;</p>\n<p>While absolutely thankful I got to see the 3 of them live three times...more than my high school self could have ever imagined...I'm gutted. The band was a way to bond with my dad and my brother. Their influence runs deep in my life. They're in my blood. And now it can't help but feel like the Depeche Mode that was...that era has ended.</p>\n<p>RIP Fletch.</p>",

    "title": "Personal Sprint Retrospectives",
    "partialText": "<p>Due to time zone differences, I'm not typically able to attend team sprint retrospectives on Fridays.</p>\n<p>If you've never done a sprint, a sprint is a set amount of time to complete a specific set of tasks. For example, we work in two week sprints at RapidAPI. I believe we did the same on the Microsoft Edge team but my work was so disconnected from traditional engineering teams, I was rarely ever working in sprints.</p>\n<p>Work can spill over into other sprints, other randomizing tasks pop up and things get re-prioritized. It happens. But overall your sprint plan sets the goals for the sprint and what tasks you'd like to ideally close out.</p>\n<p>In a sprint retrospective you go over what went well, what could be improved and what you should do more of in the upcoming sprints. I usually look at the retrospective board that gets shared out and make note of anything relevant to me as product manager, if there's anything and start sprint planning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-do-my-own-personal-sprint-retrospective\">Why I do my own personal sprint retrospective <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/10/personal-sprint-retrospective/#why-i-do-my-own-personal-sprint-retrospective\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Recently, I started doing my own personal sprint retrospective on my own for work. While I can't join the team one unless I stay up until midnight, it gives me an opportunity to reflect on what I thought went well, what can be improved in my own workflow and what I should continue doing.</p>\n<p>Doing this allows me to close out the sprint in my own way and self reflect. It also allows me to create a routine, which I'm realizing is incredibly important with the way I currently live (lots of travel).</p>\n<p>This exercise is also helpful as my scope has grown incredibly since my time at Microsoft. I was doing developer relations work but when I would do product feature work, it was just that. A feature in the browser. Now I own 4 products and experiences and the RapidAPI design system. So this allows me to drill down on where I think I can improve from a product management perspective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-of-my-personal-sprint-retrospective\">Example of my personal sprint retrospective <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/10/personal-sprint-retrospective/#example-of-my-personal-sprint-retrospective\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It doesn't have to be super detailed or in-depth. Just observations about what worked for me, with a focus on how I'm working as a product manager.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Do more of</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Keep doing</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Stop</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Turn off notifications for better focus time</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Take a walk in the morning before meetings or during ones you are just listening</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Responding to every DM or Email immediately</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Block calendar for specific project focus time</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">More 1:1s with engineers</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Over-complicating solutions that can be simple</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Have 1:1s Tue-Thur instead of 1st thing Monday</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Update Notion after every meeting</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Spec writing</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>My focus lately has been how to maximize the use of my time, especially with meetings, because for every item I cross off my to-do list, I add 5 more.</p>\n<p>With meetings for example, I noticed with the 1:1s I was having on Mondays, I wasn't feeling prepared or like I could fill a half an hour and realized it was because I was starting Monday with a solid block of meetings from 7:30 AM - 10:00 AM and sometimes 11:00 AM. I moved the 1:1s I was struggling with to Tuesday or Wednesday and felt a noticeable improvement in how productive the meeting went because I had more time to prepare an agenda.</p>\n<p>There were also optional meetings I wanted to attend for learning and observation reasons and found myself declining at the last minute because they were optional. I started taking a walk to get outside and listening to those meetings instead. Any meetings where I don't have to actively participate or present, I'm now taking while I go for a walk. It's improved my mood quite a bit and I am more inclined to listen in and learn since I'm not just sat in front of my computer. It's been helpful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-importance-of-routine\">The importance of routine <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/10/personal-sprint-retrospective/#the-importance-of-routine\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This could be and probably will be an entire blog post in itself, but I'm searching for ways to keep a routine when I'm hopping around all over the place from Seattle to Berlin for work and England to spent time with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jh3yy\">Jhey</a>. Having a personal sprint retrospective is one of those things in the routine I'm building.</p>\n<p>A little retrospective inception in the &quot;keep doing&quot; table for my sprint retrospectives: personal sprint retrospectives.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>When I was early in my career at Microsoft, I was telling my coworker Anton that I was struggling with writing one of my bi-yearly reviews because it felt like I kept getting randomized with tasks that didn’t tie back to my main projects.</p>\n<p>He showed me his OneNote and said he kept a weekly tracker of what he was supposed to be working on and documented the tasks that were unplanned that threw off his work week. I immediately started doing the same and still do it today.</p>\n<p>I find it absolutely vital when it comes to writing my self-evaluations. In product, I work on so many different things, especially at a startup, that documenting everything and keeping a running to-do list every week has already proved invaluable.</p>\n<p>I’m able to somewhat quickly go through each week and get an idea of what was worked on and how it bubbles up to a larger goal.</p>\n<p>To format this tracking, I have a section for the year. Then create a subpage for each week. You could go a step further and create a page for each day but for me I have one page that is broken down in the following way:</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"week-(mm%2Fdd-mm%2Fdd)-(this-is-the-main-subpage-for-the-week)\">Week (MM/DD-MM/DD) (This is the main subpage for the week) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/10/weekly-task-tracking/#week-(mm%2Fdd-mm%2Fdd)-(this-is-the-main-subpage-for-the-week)\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"monday-%2F-date\">Monday / Date <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/10/weekly-task-tracking/#monday-%2F-date\">#</a></h3>\n<h4 id=\"to-do-list-(tasks-i-want-to-prioritize-for-the-day)\">To Do List (Tasks I want to prioritize for the day) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/10/weekly-task-tracking/#to-do-list-(tasks-i-want-to-prioritize-for-the-day)\">#</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To Do item</li>\n<li>To Do item</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"meeting-1\">Meeting 1 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/10/weekly-task-tracking/#meeting-1\">#</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To Do item</li>\n<li>To Do item</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Meeting notes</p>\n<h4 id=\"meeting-2\">Meeting 2 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/10/weekly-task-tracking/#meeting-2\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Meeting notes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It ends up looking like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/weekly-tasks/week-template.png\" alt=\"alt: Screenshot of Notion with the format previously outlined\" /></p>\n<p>Obviously do what works for you, but this format has worked well for me one I get it set up. We're currently using ClickUp and I shudder to think about trying to dig through a year's worth of closed tasks but it also doesn't accurately capture the random requests that pop up which is why I find my weekly notes the most helpful. I'm also using Notion now instead of OneNote.</p>\n<p>I think I've finally wrangled Notion to do what I want though I miss the concept of different notebooks in OneNote. As long as it works to achieve what you want, pick your tool and roll with it.</p>",

Though to be fair, 4 of those books were 900-1000+ page books (The final 4 books of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jj2mMG\">The Wheel of Time</a>). In 2020 I read even less, but pre-2020 I was reading upwards of 24 books a year. In an effort to try to get back to that this year, I prioritized reading in the second half of the year and read 13 of my 12 books and I’ve got a few others in progress.</p>\n<p>I like to read multiple books at once because what I want to read varies depending on my mood.</p>\n<p>In terms of what I like to read, I’ve discovered that my book genres tend to be historical, fantasy and varying non-fiction around self-improvement.

Even if you put $20 toward investments in the stock market, the idea that you should just keep buying no matter if the market is up or down was spelled out clearly.

Patrick Rothfuss’ books were recommended to me. So I started book one and then I was hooked. I read book two and I read it knowing book 3 hasn’t been finished. I am on pins and needles for book 3. It’s opposite The Wheel of Time, in terms of length. Only 3 books but a fantastic read. It makes me wish there were more books planned! But it is very hard to write a book, let alone a series (Oh hey GRRM) so I’ll just bide my time with other books while I wait for book 3.</p>\n<h2 id=\"best-history-read%3A-how-iceland-changed-the-world%3A-the-big-history-of-a-small-island-by-egill-bjarnason\">Best history read: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Q0aQoi\"><em>How Iceland Changed the World: The Big History of a Small Island</em></a> by Egill Bjarnason <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/12/2022-book-roundup/#best-history-read%3A-how-iceland-changed-the-world%3A-the-big-history-of-a-small-island-by-egill-bjarnason\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I was so enamored with Iceland by the end of my trip in September I started looking for history books about the island and found this one. Unlike some history books I’ve read this one was easy to follow and covered quite a bit in under 300 pages. There’s a lot of interesting history about Iceland and its role in global politics. It was a great read.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-rest-of-my-list\">The rest of my list <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/12/2022-book-roundup/#the-rest-of-my-list\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here's the rest of my list. A few were reads to just get me in the habit of reading again. Some were driven by a desire to better myself and understand anxiety in my relationships (romantic and friendly).

    "partialText": "<p>2022 is the year that showed me once you choose to be happy and choose yourself...things drastically change in your favor. In January I was feeling lost and dejected due to an unexpected turn in my personal relationships. I was unhappy with where I was living but didn't want to move into a small apartment for an atrocious amount of money. I was struggling to see a future in my role at Microsoft despite enjoying what I was doing and that was causing anxiety. I'd have bouts of being okay with things and then spiral into anxiety again. I had tried to find a role abroad to no avail. Also I gave up on dating. The apps are terrible and the men on apps in Seattle leave a lot to be desired.</p>\n<p>So by the end of January I decided:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was going to move into a new place</li>\n<li>I was going to be happy being single and focus on my friendships</li>\n<li>I was going to make the most of work and doing DevRel for Edge</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And everything fell into place.</p>\n<p>I found a lovely little house to rent in West Seattle through one of my friends. With a yard for my dog and within walking distance to the main strip of shops and restaurants.</p>\n<p>I took a few trips to places familiar and new. I interviewed for a new job too, somehwat unexpectedly. I wasn't sure if I'd actually take it...but I did. A senior product management role and a move to Berlin. What a life change!</p>\n<p>And then the conferences started. 2022 was actually going pretty well for me. New place, travel, new job.</p>\n<p>And wouldn't you know it, at All Day Hey! in Leeds, I unexpectedly met my partner, Jhey, who made me realize what an actual partnership felt like. What it's like to date someone who actually wants to date you and loves your quirks...someone who <em>will</em> fly across the world for you instead of string you along.</p>\n<p>Jhey is the most unexpected part of 2022, as well as the best. And he is currently making me laugh as I write this. Never settle because you deserve to have your needs met.</p>\n<p>The rest of the year has been a whirlwind. My book is right on the cusp of being finished, just finishing up the last round of edits. I have traveled more than I care to if I'm honest. I am reveling in this extended period in Seattle before moving abroad. I don't know how some people do it...back to back international trips with a week or less in between. I have done quite a few of those and phew is it a lot.</p>\n<p>One highlight that unexpectedly occured on December 30th was seeing a group of 8 orcas swim past. I had just driven my mom to Bellevue from SeaTac and my WhatsApp wildlife group started going off. I expected I would miss them because they always round Alki point in West Seattle and head west. They didn't this time. And on the cusp of darkness they passed by. I have been chasing them for 6 months and what a wonderful wonderful way for me to close the year out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2022-by-the-numbers\">2022 by the numbers <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/12/2022-year-in-review/#2022-by-the-numbers\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>90,000-ish actual miles traveled</li>\n<li>6 countries visited</li>\n<li>1044 books sold (as of the publishing of this post)</li>\n<li>7 conferences</li>\n<li>13 books read</li>\n<li>1 case of COVID</li>\n<li>2 wild horse encounters in Arizona</li>\n<li>1 orca pod viewable from the shore</li>\n<li>150+ walks down by the water, making me fall in love with Seattle all over</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"happy-new-year\">Happy New Year <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2022/12/2022-year-in-review/#happy-new-year\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I hope the closing to 2022 is just what you need, whether the year was good or bad. 2023 holds some drastic life changes for me, some travel and the release of my book.

    "title": "An Intro to Trigonometric CSS Functions",
    "partialText": "<p>While perusing the <a href=\"https://web.dev/web-platform-12-2022/\">December 2022 post from web.dev</a> about what's new in the web platform, the addition of Trigonometric CSS functions in Firefox caught my eye.</p>\n<p>Geometry and trigonometry were my two best math areas in school (I am not an Algebra person and generally did not enjoy math class), so I wanted to a quick look at these functions and what problems they solve for the web platform. When would developers use them?</p>\n<h2 id=\"trigonometric-css-functions-overview\">Trigonometric CSS Functions Overview <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-trigonometric-functions/#trigonometric-css-functions-overview\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As of December 2022, Firefox and Safari are the two mainstream browsers that support Trigonometric CSS Functions. These include <code>cos()</code>, <code>sin()</code>, <code>tan()</code>, <code>asin()</code>, <code>acos()</code>. <code>atan()</code>, and <code>atan2()</code>.</p>\n<p>Support in Chromium is estimated to ship in version 111.</p>\n<h3 id=\"basic-use-cases-per-the-mdn-documentation\">Basic use cases per the MDN documentation <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-trigonometric-functions/#basic-use-cases-per-the-mdn-documentation\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>cos()</code>: can be used to keep the size of a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cos#keep_the_size_of_a_rotated_box\">rotated box</a></li>\n<li><code>sin()</code>: can be used to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sin#boxes_size\">size boxes</a> and as an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sin#controlling_animation_duration\"><code>animation-duration</code> value</a></li>\n<li><code>tan()</code>: can be used to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/tan#draw_parallelograms\">draw parallelograms</a></li>\n<li><code>asin()</code>: can be used to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/asin\">rotate elements</a></li>\n<li><code>acos()</code>: can be used to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/acos#rotate_elements\">rotate elements</a></li>\n<li><code>atan()</code>: can be used to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/atan#examples\">rotate elements</a></li>\n<li><code>atan2()</code>: can be used to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/atan2#rotate_elements\">rotate elements</a> and accepts two values as parameters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The MDN docs highlight the differences between the 4 functions for rotating elements. For example, <code>atan()</code> returns the inverse tangent of two values between -infinity and infinity, whereas <code>sin()</code> returns the sine of a number that has a value between -1 and 1.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-problems-do-they-solve-for-developers%3F\">What problems do they solve for developers? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-trigonometric-functions/#what-problems-do-they-solve-for-developers%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>At first glance, the use cases for these functions don't seem incredibly compelling to me. The MDN documentation use cases for rotating a shape or defining widths of elements don't seem that useful for a developer. We can already do those things and the examples with these functions seem long winded.</p>\n<p>So I went and found the <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2331\">CSSWG GitHub discussion</a> to dig into the &quot;why?&quot;</p>\n<p>The main takeaway: these additions to CSS mean more complex animations that can be built with CSS and not JavaScript. This <a href=\"https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/JNZGwE/\">animation example from Ana Tudor</a> is a good example. Trigonometric computations are done in JavaScript to achieve a seamless animation effect where the points line up exactly as they rotate and when the orange shapes skew on each rotation.</p>\n<p>Another possible use case that came up elsewhere was using these to create charts and graphs in CSS, but this raises a question around responsiveness and scaling those angles and curves, though responsive skewing is mentioned in the GitHub issue.</p>\n<p><em>Update January 6, 2023</em></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/issues/149\">GitHub issue</a> explains some more use cases for trigonometric functions.</p>\n<p>I was surprised to see complex layouts on the list, but when discussing this with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jh3yy\">Jhey</a> he mentioned using <code>sin()</code> to lay things out on a curve which could introduce some interesting layout possibility!</p>\n<p>Here's a demo from Jhey (again, you'll need a browser that supports this feature or Chrome or Edge Canary with the experimental web platform features flag turned on.)</p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-slug-hash=\"RwBoEVM\" data-user=\"jh3y\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/RwBoEVM\">\n  Image Layout with CSS Trigonometric Functions ✨ [Tap to toggle]</a> by Jhey (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/jh3y\">@jh3y</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing thoughts <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-trigonometric-functions/#closing-thoughts\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The addition of more math functions to CSS reduces some reliance on JavaScript which I view as a win. The primary use case for these seems to be easier shape creation and more options for building complex animations.</p>\n<p>If you're building and maintaining an average website, I don't see these being overly useful, but I'd love to know if you have a use case for these functions.

    "partialText": "<p>January 1st 2022 Steph was very sad after struggling to get through the night before. A personal event on the 30th of December shredded me emotionally. I have to commend my friends, my love for them is infinite, and instead of forcing me to be present for the entire night, gave me the space I needed and let me just exist around them. The roused me for midnight fireworks and I ended up staying up a little bit more.</p>\n<p>I decided 2022 was the year I choose myself and that I would find actual happiness. It was very fake it until I make it that first month of the year.</p>\n<p>I decided to do two things to be happy. I started doing gratitude journaling, finding 3 things to be grateful for everyday, and I decided to film 1 second everyday so I would have a recap of the year. I was influenced by seeing people's 1 second everyday videos so I thought I'd give it a go.</p>\n<p>I decided to use the 1se app on iOS because I could set up notifications to remind me everyday to take a second. And while I remembered most days to grab a quick snippet, I could still drop a photo in from the day (I take a lot of photos) if I forgot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/1-second-everyday/#what-i-learned\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I didn't have this realization until the last month or so, but taking time to capture 1 second out of everyday, even on the most horrible days of my year, meant that there was still some bit of joy to find in every single day of the year.</p>\n<p>Choosing to find happiness in each day is a choice. You have to make that decision for yourself. You can try and chase all the things that you think will make you happy.</p>\n<p>It sounds a bit cheesy and I know a million people before have said it. But you have to choose happiness to find it. Things that make you happy are fleeting and are there one minute and then gone the next. It's beyond those moments that you have to choose happiness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"am-i-happier-now-than-last-year%3F\">Am I happier now than last year? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/1-second-everyday/#am-i-happier-now-than-last-year%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Yes. I am. My perspective has changed drastically in the last year. I had some pretty awful moments this year...like putting my dog who was 14 down with my ex-husband. Diagnosed with bipolar depression, which was scary at first but now it all makes sense.</p>\n<p>I chose me in 2022. And I chose happiness. Even if I had to fake it for a month.</p>\n<p>Here's to the next 365 seconds of 2023 and finding joy in simple moments. Who knows what's bound to come.</p>",

Two of my headings span two lines on small devices and this was making the content too tight together.

    "title": "Greater styling control over type with CSS `initial-letter`",
    "partialText": "<p>Today we're taking a look at another new addition to CSS that's about to land in browsers: <code>initial-letter</code>. This property is still experimental with support in Safari but it is supported in Chromium Canary browsers. It is a bit buggy at times and I encountered issues with DevTools crashing on me so it's still obviously experimental.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-initial-letter-and-what-does-it-do%3F\">What is <code>initial-letter</code> and what does it do? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-initial-letter/#what-is-initial-letter-and-what-does-it-do%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The CSS property <code>initial-letter</code> brings more control and styling over the first letter in a block of text...meaning we can get a little bit more fancy with our typography without hacky tricks.</p>\n<p><code>Initial-letter</code> is a property that applies to the pseudo element <code>::first-letter</code>. It lets you control the size of the first letter with a number that indicates how many lines tall the letter should be, and another value, an integer that can be added to indicate how many lines down the letter should sink.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say we want our letter to be 3 line lengths tall. We would write the following:</p>\n<pre><code>p::first-letter {\n  initial-letter: 3;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And in turn this would render the letter 3 lines tall:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/initial-letter/il-3.png\" alt=\"alt: Our first letter of each paragraph is 3 lines tall\" /></p>\n<p>Let's bring in the second value to change where the letter is. The letter will still be 3 lines tall but we want it to sink to the fourth line.</p>\n<pre><code>p::first-letter {\n  initial-letter: 3 4;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/initial-letter/il-3-4.png\" alt=\"alt: Our first letter of each paragraph is 3 lines tall and sinks to the fourth line\" /></p>\n<p>Pretty neat and it only takes a line of code!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-this-solve-for-developers%3F\">What does this solve for developers? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-initial-letter/#what-does-this-solve-for-developers%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The power of this property lies in the ability to remove hacks around styling and positioning the first letter of a block of text. There's no wrapping of your first letter in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or anything like that. The ability to size based on line height scales the letter nicely too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-examples\">More examples <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-initial-letter/#more-examples\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Let's look at a more styled demo. You can find the source code on my demo page: <a href=\"https://stephs-demos.netlify.app/initial-letter/\">CSS initial-letter demo</a>.</p>\n<p>Technically we are able to size the first letter based on line height with <code>font-size: 2lh;</code> or however many lines you'd like the letter to be tall. But we get the following with that declaration:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/initial-letter/2lh.png\" alt=\"alt: Our first letter has a font size of 2lh applied\" /></p>\n<p>It doesn't quite look right especially when I want to create a really illustration focused first letter. The same thing happens if I try a value of <code>4lh</code>...</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/initial-letter/4lh.png\" alt=\"alt: Our first letter has a font size of 4lh applied and there is a massive gap below the first normal sized line of text\" /></p>\n<p>It may be 4 lines high but it continues to create a massive gap below the first line. It doesn't align well with the rest of the type either.</p>\n<p>When I use initial letter to handle my sizing though, I get the following design with a letter that aligns nicely to the left of the normal sized text and is actually positioned as 4 lines tall.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/initial-letter/initial-letter.png\" alt=\"alt: Using initial letter \" /></p>\n<p>The important bits of CSS for the above display are as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>  initial-letter: 4 6;\n  padding: 2.2rem 2.6rem;\n  font-weight: 900;\n  margin-right: .5rem;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've added some padding and font weight to control the styling of the first letter a bit more.</p>\n<p>You can inspect the demo for the full set of styles. I would like to note that outlining your letter doesn't appear to work if you have initial-letter applied, which seems like a miss in functionality. I've achieved the outline effect with a text shadow for this demo.</p>\n<p>I added an SVG background for the illuminated text treatment, and there's probably some neat animation effects you could apply.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-notes\">Other notes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-initial-letter/#other-notes\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is just the start of <code>initial-letter</code>, per the <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1276900\">Chromium issue</a>, there are still items in the works:</p>\n<p>Following CSS properties are not implemented yet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>initial-letter-align</code></li>\n<li><code>initial-letter-wrap</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And following features are not implemented yet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>multi-character initial letters (such as for first word or first phrase styling)</li>\n<li>inside-positioned ::marker pseudo-elements</li>\n<li>inline-level boxes that are placed at the start of the first line</li>\n<li>atomic inline</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So stay tuned for more to come.</p>\n<h3 id=\"browser-support\">Browser support <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-initial-letter/#browser-support\">#</a></h3>\n<p>As of right now, <code>initial-letter</code> is supported in Safari, though <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=initial-letter\">caniuse</a> says the implementation is incomplete, and it is coming soon to Chromium.</p>\n<p>I'm working in Edge Canary (Chromium) with the experimental web platform feature flag turned on, and the feature just shipped in the beta version of Chrome 110.</p>\n<p>Firefox doesn't appear to be support at all though there was a little bit of movement on the Gecko issue for it, but anything beyond that doesn't seem to be clear. Hopefully it will be prioritized as this feature brings some easy to implement capabilities for good typography on the web.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/1/css-initial-letter/#resources\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here's my <a href=\"https://stephs-demos.netlify.app/initial-letter/\">demo page</a> link<br />\n<a href=\"https://codepen.io/seaotta/pen/OJwmpWj\">A basic codepen</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial-letter\">MDN Docs</a></p>",

I currently juggle 6 products at work and while I make a daily to-do list of things I'd like to accomplish, everything just wasn't getting done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"time-blocking-for-work\">Time-blocking for work <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/02/time-blocking/#time-blocking-for-work\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So I started placing project focus blocks on my calendar. &quot;Focus time&quot; to tackle my to-do list each day for work. But at the end of the day, sometimes only one or two asks were getting checked off my list. Sometimes I have upwards of 7 things I'm trying to accomplish in a day, both new initiative work and repeating admin work (<em>waves to the multiple backlogs I'm trying to wrangle</em>), on top of meetings, but generalized &quot;focus time&quot; wasn't working.</p>\n<p>Enter time-blocking. I started blocking off half hour and hour long chunks of time with a designated project or task to work on in my calendar.</p>\n<p>I've seen an improvement but not to the extent I want to. However, I've started to gain a better understanding of why things aren't improving like I want to. I work in a startup and when I start my day with my to-do list and hop on Slack, I have a whole list of things that may need my attention immediately or sometime during the day depending on the severity.</p>\n<p>time-blocking does help make time for the things I need to get done but some of those things that need to get done can change day to day so I still feel a bit scattered. But I decided to read a book to see if I could help myself even more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"time-blocking-for-your-life\">Time-blocking for your life <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/02/time-blocking/#time-blocking-for-your-life\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IuFzI1\"><em>Time-Blocking: Your Method to Supercharge Productivity &amp; Reach Your Goals</em></a> by Like Seavers to further help my productivity journey. It gives a good framework for how to time-block your life to maximize productivity and what's important to you. The three things that stuck in my head after reading this book:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being good at multitasking is a lie</li>\n<li>The maximum number of things you should try to accomplish in a day is 3</li>\n<li>time-blocking isn't just for work, it's for your whole life</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's talk about point number one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"being-good-at-multitasking-is-a-lie\">Being good at multitasking is a lie <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/02/time-blocking/#being-good-at-multitasking-is-a-lie\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I remember filling out applications for jobs claiming I was a proficient multitasker when I first started working. And I think I was, but I say that because the work I was doing was not like the work I was doing now. I can multitask office work: preparing paperwork, writing receipts, checking rent payments. I cannot multitask high level strategy for 6 different areas of work.</p>\n<p>I didn't multitask different design projects at the same time when I was doing design. In fact, I was even time-blocking work then, but in a bit of a different way because I had to keep track of billable hours. But I would focus on one design project for a client and then switch to another project for a different client.</p>\n<p>We are simply not designed to multitask no matter what the modern productivity machine would tell you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"three-is-the-ideal-amount-of-tasks-you-should-focus-on-in-a-day\">Three is the ideal amount of tasks you should focus on in a day <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/02/time-blocking/#three-is-the-ideal-amount-of-tasks-you-should-focus-on-in-a-day\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Anything more than that probably won't be quality work. This is perhaps where I struggle. I cannot dedicate 3 big chunks of time in my day to only 3 tasks. So while I try to put a cap on what I say I can accomplish in a day...it's not three things. It's still in the 5+ range. But the book also talked about determining what your essentials are so perhaps I need to revisit what those essentials in my life are.</p>\n<h3 id=\"time-block-for-all-the-important-things-in-your-life\">Time-block for all the important things in your life <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/02/time-blocking/#time-block-for-all-the-important-things-in-your-life\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I appreciated Seavers' view of time-blocking. It shouldn't just be something you do for work. You should also time-block for the important things in your personal life. time-block for family time, for a workout, etc so those important things outside of your work are accounted for.</p>\n<p>I personally like this. It helps to keep things in perspective and helps you be accountable to your personal goals. This is probably important to me because I've worked on some aspect of the web for the last 7 years in a way that creeps into my personal time. When I'm not PMing for <a href=\"https://rapidapi.com/products/rapidapi-platform/\">API Developer Tools</a>, I'm learning and writing about new web platform features. One of my hobbies is being online...so I'm online. A lot. time-blocking for the things that aren't online helps me ensure I'm stepping away from the computer.</p>\n<p>I keep a habit tracker in my bullet journal as well to keep track of how often I work out, go for a walk, practice German, and read.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what's-the-point-of-time-blocking%3F\">What's the point of time-blocking? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/02/time-blocking/#what's-the-point-of-time-blocking%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Time-blocking ensures you're productive (and yes, spending time with your family is productive) and spending time doing the things that roll up to your high-level goals. The core of time-blocking is that you're scheduling blocks of time to help you work toward something. Whether it is spending more time with your family, improving your health, writing a book, or accomplishing projects at work, time-blocking is one methodology to help you allocate time.</p>\n<p>Luke Seavers details a rather good blueprint on how to lay out your goals so that you ensure your sub-tasks track back up to high level goals.</p>\n<p>Honestly it's like OKRs for your personal life which I'm finding helpful to put some direction in place after a chaotic international move, all the travel I do, and all the side projects I've got bouncing around in my head.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources-for-time-blocking\">Resources for time-blocking <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/02/time-blocking/#resources-for-time-blocking\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Aside from books, there are daily planners that can help you time-block. I use my own bullet journal that I draw up every week because I find it quite meditative before diving into the digital world for the week. There are many options for planners available online already.</p>\n<div class=\"promo-box\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 6rem); grid-gap:1rem;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Time-Blocking-Method-Supercharge-Productivity-Reach/dp/B08RZ4Y78J?pd_rd_w=ESE4V&content-id=amzn1.sym.7f0cf323-50c6-49e3-b3f9-63546bb79c92&pf_rd_p=7f0cf323-50c6-49e3-b3f9-63546bb79c92&pf_rd_r=9ZMJBH82N5YBD5HK4GAH&pd_rd_wg=DeGrT&pd_rd_r=49c371c2-720c-472c-9285-62f13bb30a33&pd_rd_i=B08RZ4Y78J&psc=1&linkCode=li3&tag=stephaniestim-20&linkId=4b3a961e67b3e801f5ca724fbb70d94a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08RZ4Y78J&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US\" /></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B08RZ4Y78J\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Time-Blocking-Day-Planner-Luke-Seavers/dp/B08S4TJZH6?&linkCode=li2&tag=stephaniestim-20&linkId=49c59ec0838d4b0064008481754c0645&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08S4TJZH6&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US\" /></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B08S4TJZH6\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1520902271?psc=1&pd_rd_i=1520902271&pd_rd_w=OI1kF&content-id=amzn1.sym.88097cb9-5064-44ef-891b-abfacbc1c44b&pf_rd_p=88097cb9-5064-44ef-891b-abfacbc1c44b&pf_rd_r=9ZMJBH82N5YBD5HK4GAH&pd_rd_wg=DeGrT&pd_rd_r=49c371c2-720c-472c-9285-62f13bb30a33&s=books&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzVVc2Sjg5TTZKVlU2JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODc5NjQwOEE4Mk5URUJZWVlSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA1ODIzNjZITUVBVUZYWTJMUDUmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWwmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&linkCode=li2&tag=stephaniestim-20&linkId=a1be8971ffc85e35f620e73d5e539d2f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1520902271&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US\" /></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=1520902271\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Daily-Method-Distracted/dp/0593192052?crid=MNXB7GZT9MN1&keywords=time+blocking&qid=1676584393&sprefix=time+blocking%2Caps%2C133&sr=8-7&linkCode=li2&tag=stephaniestim-20&linkId=4bcd23ab60dceea3149a9608067b1f7d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0593192052&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US\" /></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=0593192052\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Two-Tumbleweeds-Organizer-Academic-Notebooks/dp/B0812QD3PM?crid=MNXB7GZT9MN1&keywords=time+blocking&qid=1676584393&sprefix=time+blocking%2Caps%2C133&sr=8-38&linkCode=li2&tag=stephaniestim-20&linkId=117b68b052678726dcb447b11f4e0a87&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0812QD3PM&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US\" /></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=stephaniestim-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B0812QD3PM\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /></p>\n</div>\n<p>Cheers and happy time-blocking!</p>",

    "title": "Crash and Burnout",
    "partialText": "<p>In the last year I have changed jobs, moved twice (one of those internationally) and traveled about 120,000 miles. I've been working on finishing <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers?utm_source=stimac&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=book_stimac_design_4_19_22&amp;a_aid=stimac&amp;a_bid=5f6ba095\">my book</a>, caught covid, and was diagnosed with bipolar depression and Hashimoto's disease.</p>\n<p>Additionally, with so much travel, I've had to leave my dog with my parents for an extended period of time and while she's spoiled rotten by her grandparents, she is my familiar. My stress reducer who helps me maintain some semblance of balance.</p>\n<p>I've also been dealing with an online harasser who has attempted to accuse of me of plagiarism and get me fired from my job because I had the gall to call out an email that they sent me. This person, who I don't know, who I had blocked on social media, engaged with me in a way that made me incredibly uncomfortable, and proceeded to call me mentally ill for leaving my job at Microsoft. They have continued to pop up on and off over the last year in an alarming fashion, going so far as to impersonate someone on the Rapid exec team.</p>\n<p>Both my publisher and my exec team at Rapid have been understanding but having someone attempt to tear apart your life because you exercised a boundary (and are generally pretty outspoken about this sort of harassment in general), is still incredibly stress inducing.</p>\n<p>On top of this, the only time I have been in one place longer than 3 weeks in the last year was last July and while I took a little bit of time around the holidays, that can hardly be counted as rest since I was packing up to move to Berlin.</p>\n<p>While I'm not ready to discuss all the culminating bits that finally forced me to take a break, I can say, it should never have gotten that far and I should have set firmer boundaries around taking time to rest. The more I couldn't focus and think properly during the day, the harder I tried to push through to make up for not feeling like I was being as productive as I could have.</p>\n<p>Surprise. Pushing your way through exhaustion is not the way to solve anything and it finally started to affect my physical health.</p>\n<p>A big factor for pushing through was feeling guilt because I wasn't super present with work while packing up my entire life to move abroad. Something I did <em>alone</em> and in itself is worthy of rest. That sort of life change is massive and apart from doing it alone, it also felt incredibly lonely because I don't think a lot of people understand how much work, mental and physical, it is.</p>\n<h2 id=\"time-to-rest\">Time to rest <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/04/burnout/#time-to-rest\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So now, I'm here. I've had two weeks off. I disconnected to do nothing but rest and nourish myself, and I've found it incredibly uncomfortable at times but it is getting easier. I decided to stay in the UK for a bit because the support and comfort of my partner is incredibly vital for me right now.</p>\n<p>The biggest realization has been that two weeks off will not fix this. It has been necessary. But lifestyle changes and reprioritization of my physical and mental health are key moving forward. I intend to be more intentional with my life.</p>\n<p>A few things I've been doing or using to help me recover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I've largely disconnected from Twitter and have been reading instead. Read/Reading: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/43ojnYG\">Braving the Wilderness</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MDxBi2\">Running on Red Dog Road</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3UkykH3\">The Way of Kings</a>.</li>\n<li>I've been doing yoga and meditation and will continue with barre classes. My therapist recommended light exercise, nothing hardcore, to help with anxiety.</li>\n<li>Hydrate. Hydrate. Hydrate. I love coffee but I drink a full glass of water in the morning before having any coffee.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Gx2q4p\">Weighted blanket</a> for sleep. I have slept solidly through the night for two weeks with a weighted blanket. I had one in Seattle that I loved but left there. I needed the 15lbs for other things in my suitcase. It</li>\n<li>Listen to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX9JGJTJ2WFXi?si=cec4a0ac3d904e62\">Solfeggio Frequencies</a>. I've had 396hz playlists on while I read, do yoga, and clean. Whether you believe in the healing properties or not, it's been incredibly soothing.</li>\n<li>Journaling.</li>\n<li>Overall limiting screen time. I read this article from <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-playing-field/202101/how-recover-burnout\">Psychology Today</a> at the start of my two weeks and I'm glad I did. Active recovery vs passive recovery (ex. watching TV) has made a huge difference.</li>\n<li>Nutrition. Taking time to eat 3 meals a day and cook. Yes. I actually had to do this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The way in which my stress started to manifest physically put me in an incredibly dark spot. When it starts to affect you physically, you suddenly realize you've pushed too far. Masking has also taken an incredible toll on me.</p>\n<p>I take incredible pride in the work I do, but I need to check that pride to make sure I take care of myself.</p>\n<p>Despite autoimmune diseases and bipolar depression, I've accomplished so much the last few years. Speaking at conferences, writing a book, work promotions...the path forward now is just taking it day by day. Making sure I take care of me, so I can feel good about what I do...or what I don't do, and making sure what I do is serving me in some way that aligns with my goals.</p>\n<p>For now, my biggest struggle is being okay with not being busy. With not doing anything. Busy is not a badge of honor.</p>",

    "title": "Serving less data with the `prefers-reduced-data` media query",
    "partialText": "<p>I want to take a quick look at another experimental CSS feature today that's focused on tailoring what gets served to a user based on their preferences, but this time it's performance based.</p>\n<p>Similar to media queries like <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> and <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>, the media query <code>prefers-reduced-data</code> would allow developers to serve up a separate set of styles for those who want to limit the amount of data that gets downloaded. There are a multitude of reasons someone may want to reduce the amount of data being downloaded (Read: <a href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-30-2019-performance/\">Location, Privilege and Performant Websites</a>).</p>\n<p>It's a CSS media query so it gets inserted into a CSS stylesheet and can either be set to to <code>prefers-reduced-data: no-preference</code> or <code>prefers-reduced-data: reduce</code>. Immediately the two resource consuming items that can be controlled via CSS that come to mind are fonts and images.</p>\n<p>You can serve up smaller or no images, and you can limit the fonts and font styles that are pulled in. At first I thought these would be the main items you'd want to use the media query. But if you're just serving up smaller sized images, this begs the question, shouldn't you be doing that anyway? Everyone would benefit from smaller image sizes.</p>\n<p>The other use case I can imagine is on the extreme end, and is influenced by NPR's <a href=\"https://text.npr.org/\">text only website</a> they provide for people. You could provide an extremely stripped down version of a website, for the purpose of highlighting the essential content without having to maintain another URL.</p>\n<p>In some ways, this seems like a useful media query, but at the same time I'm prompted to ask: does it fully solve the problem of serving less data consuming experiences to those who want that option? Or are there already other ways to do this effectively outside of a media query?</p>\n<h2 id=\"browser-support\">Browser support <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/4/css-prefers-reduced-data/#browser-support\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Whether this really solves the problem of serving less data remains to be seen. The media query is not currently supported in any browser. There had been a little bit of activity on the issue last year but there hasn't been much movement since.</p>\n<p>In the Chrome DevTools though, you can <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-86/#emulate-prefers-reduced-data\">emulate the media query</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"information-and-discussion\">Information and discussion <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/4/css-prefers-reduced-data/#information-and-discussion\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here's the <a href=\"https://chromestatus.com/feature/5922192355229696\">Chrome Status</a> link for the feature. If this is something you want to see in browsers and want to help signal that desire and have a discussion around it, I'd suggest submitting the idea to the <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">Web We Want</a> to track it there (the initiative is starting to kick back up again!).</p>\n<p>Mozilla Developer Documentation: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-data\">Here</a></p>",

    "partialText": "<p>A few weeks ago, I was sat in a conference room with two of my engineering managers talking about JWT tokens, session IDs and OAuth.</p>\n<p>I am not an engineer and I don't pretend to be one. I have web development chops, but I loathe JavaScript and lean into my design background (CSS and the Cascade &lt;3).</p>\n<p>When I interviewed for my role at RapidAPI, I was asked if I'd ever worked with APIs or an API Client, I gave a resounding and honest &quot;No...but I can learn.&quot;  When I started at Microsoft, I didn't know what the web platform was and that it and browser engines were the reason I spent many nights of my experience design career trying to make things work across all different browsers with my design lead. I can learn and I did.</p>\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<p>At some point during this meeting, I felt completely out of place. I am not this technical (I am technical in other respects), and I don't want to detract at all from the generosity of both my engineering leads. They would walk me through the technical architecture of things to help me understand. That sort of empathy in my career has been rare...genuinely taking the time to walk me through something after a meeting without me having to ask, or enthusiastically taking time to explain the details when I would ask.</p>\n<p>I felt so out of place that I wanted to laugh, at myself, because for all my overthinking and attempts to plan things...sitting in an office in Berlin talking about authentication and backend architecture was not in my plan. Certainly not the plan of the web designer.</p>\n<p>Because two years ago, I would not have had this anywhere remotely on my radar. Not even in my plan. Nor could the woman sitting there wondering how she wound up in Berlin discussing authentication options imagine she would find herself laid off a month later with 50% of the company.</p>\n<p>I'm not unique. The amount of layoffs in the industry has been staggering. But after a week of processing, of ups and downs, I know something new and exciting is around the corner.</p>\n<p>It's like when a relationship ends - you shouldn't think of it as time wasted, it's not. You grew in some way and while that pain can feel insurmountable, it will lessen with time.</p>\n<p>In a very funny way, I went from feeling very alone in Berlin to having a support network. I now know many people who are no longer coworkers. We supported each other as coworkers exploring a new city because most of us are expats, and we'll support each other through this.</p>\n<p>And so instead of a conference room, sat wondering how I ended up talking about authentication options, I'm sat in my apartment in Berlin's city center, with my windows open soaking in the spring warmth, listening to Vivaldi's Spring 1 Recomposed by Max Richter, wondering what comes next. Because something will. Many things will.

    "partialText": "<p>Routine is incredibly important, and its importance is something I didn't quite grasp until recently. When your routine is in chaos, it can affect your life leading to a decline in mental and physical health.</p>\n<p>At the start of 2021, I started a gratitude journal. My divorce has been finalized in 2020, and I'd been in a relationship for 13 years so I was still trying to navigate relationships and disappointment and figuring out what &quot;normal&quot; life was. So, I started a gratitude journal as a habit.</p>\n<p>I was determined to write down 3 things every day that I was thankful for. Overall, I've been pretty consistent. There have been times of chaos where I just haven't had the time or space to do so religiously (particularly the past year) but I have kept doing it even if it wasn't every day.</p>\n<p>In the last 3 weeks I have been consistent and find myself gravitating to my journal as a way to re-establish routine and what's important. I've come to realize is that gratitude is key to be okaying with what's happening in your life. It helps you reframe everything and operate within a state of grace.</p>\n<p>There are always things to be thankful for, even in the most grim of times or when things seem impossible. It helps keep you optimistic, and for me that's been key to navigating the layoffs with Rapid and move forward even when I have moments of panic. Everything will be okay.</p>\n<p>Today:<br />\nI'm thankful that the sun is shining in Berlin again.<br />\nI'm thankful for the ability to share and ask for help within the Rapid Alumni Slack group.<br />\nI'm thankful for a slow day where I have no commitments.</p>",

    "title": "Designing for Dual Screen and Foldable Devices With CSS",
    "partialText": "<p>With the announcement of Google's <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_fold\">Pixel Fold</a>, I thought its an apt time to revisit what technologies are available for designing and developing experiences that adapt to a foldable device.</p>\n<p>Let's ignore the naysayers who vehemently don't want to design for a new form factor, while also ignoring the price of Goggle's first generation device and just focus on what's possible right now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"css-media-queries-for-viewport-segments\">CSS Media Queries for Viewport Segments <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/05/design-foldable-devices/#css-media-queries-for-viewport-segments\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are two media queries for targeting your foldable device.</p>\n<pre><code>@media (horizontal-viewport-segments: &lt;count&gt;) { }\n@media (vertical-viewport-segments: &lt;count&gt;) { }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>horizontal-viewport-segments</code> query targets the device when it is being held like a book and the two screens are side-by-side.</p>\n<p>And <code>vertical-viewport-segments</code> targets the device when the two screens are stacked on top of each other and fold like a laptop. I've found this mode useful when using my Surface Duo with PowerPoint. I can access my speaker notes on the bottom screen and my presentation is on the top screen. Pretty snazzy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"css-environment-variables\">CSS Environment Variables <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/05/design-foldable-devices/#css-environment-variables\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In order to get the geometry of each display, a handful of environment variables have been created for dual screen devices.</p>\n<pre><code>env(viewport-segment-width &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;);\nenv(viewport-segment-height &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;);\nenv(viewport-segment-top &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;);\nenv(viewport-segment-left &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;);\nenv(viewport-segment-bottom &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;);\nenv(viewport-segment-right &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The x and y positions represent the two-dimensional grid created by hardware features that separate each viewport segment, with the coordinates 0,0 starting at the top-left segment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/env-var/3-env-variables.webp\" alt=\"alt: The environment variables laid out on each display screen with the integers for each display\" />]</p>\n<p>Environment variables are cool because they will calculate dimensions by the device and make the adjustments for you meaning you don't have to create designs for every unique device out there. There are a number of foldable devices already and they all have different screen and hinge dimensions.</p>\n<p>This set of environment variables also lets you place and position content across the two screens.</p>\n<p>In my demo, I've built a recipe page that changes to a two column layout when on a dual screen device. I'm using CSS Grid and I can use the environment variables as grid column or row values.</p>\n<pre><code>@media (horizontal-viewport-segments: 2) { \n\n    .container {\n        grid-template-columns: env(viewport-segment-width 0 0), 1fr;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This line of code means that the first grid column will take up the entirety of left display when the device is held in the vertical position (like a book), and the second grid column will take up the remaining width of the display space available, which is the display on the right.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to be more explicit, you could write:</p>\n<pre><code>@media (horizontal-viewport-segments: 2) { \n\n    .container {\n        grid-template-columns: env(viewport-segment-width 0 0) env(viewport-segment-width: 1 0);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, this means that each column takes up a display. Pretty sweet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-should-you-include-a-dual-screen-mode-in-your-product%3F\">When should you include a dual screen mode in your product? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/05/design-foldable-devices/#when-should-you-include-a-dual-screen-mode-in-your-product%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Back to the naysayers. When I first started talking about dual screen design, so many people reacted negatively.  And honestly, no one is forcing you to create a website or app that adapts when it's spanned across two displays.</p>\n<p>With the Surface Duo, you can utilize the browser in one display pane and it displays like a normal responsive website.  Not every site or app <em>does</em> need a dual screen mode, but its best to find out what kind of devices your customers are using and whether or not a dual screen mode is worth the investment. As always, use data to guide your decisions.</p>\n<p>The forecast for foldables shipped in 2023 is expected to be above 21 million devices <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50531423\">(source)</a>. Compared to the mobile device market, its just a sliver, but that's still millions of foldables being used out there.</p>\n<p>The other reason I'd create an app or website that adapts for a foldable device? If I wanted to stand out.</p>\n<p>The Pixel Fold reinforces that foldables are here to stay, so why not delight your users?</p>\n<h2 id=\"browser-support\">Browser Support <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/05/design-foldable-devices/#browser-support\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The media queries and environment variables are currently supported in Microsoft Edge Stable.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Chrome Stable doesn't appear to have the same support yet which seems like a huge miss for the Pixel Fold &amp; Chrome teams. You can enable the experimental web platform flag under <code>chrome://flags</code> and test in Chrome with the Surface Duo emulator.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\">Closing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/05/design-foldable-devices/#closing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This article is just an overview and reminder that these capabilities exist for foldable web and app experiences. The space is ripe for innovation in design and layout on the web (and for native apps) as new foldable devices ship, but without the browser and OS support, companies won't be able to get devs and designers to take building foldable experiences seriously.</p>\n<p>If your'e still interested exploring what's possible with dual screen layouts, I've a much more in depth article over on <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/03/building-web-layouts-dual-screen-foldable-devices\">Smashing Magazine</a> that walks through the <a href=\"https://stephaniestimac.com/demos/smashing-ds-demo/\">recipe demo</a> I made for the web. So download Microsoft Edge and happy building.</p>",

But it was also fun and I learned loads about myself, what I'm capable of achieving, and perhaps most importantly what matters to me when it comes to having a fulfilled life. It was disappointing how things ended, with the company being reduced to less than 50 people from over 200 but sometimes things happen that, plainly put, suck.

    "title": "Just Build It...",
    "partialText": "<p>After I started at Microsoft in 2016, I built my own HTML portfolio website instead of using a template. The template I had been using was gorgeous and interactive but I hadn't built it. So I built one.</p>\n<p>CSS Grid wasn't even fully supported yet and there were fallbacks with Flexbox. I didn't know how to use templating to insert headers and footers and whenever I wanted to update the footer or menu had to painstakingly go through each page and update each one individually.</p>\n<p>It did the job and showcased the design work from the previous 4 years. I eventually updated it with a few demos and tools I had worked on at Microsoft.</p>\n<p>And over the last 3-4 years, I've probably attempted a re-design no less than 10 times. I would start to design in Illustrator, I would then start building and then abandon it. My biggest hinderance was wanting my website to be tied to my personal identity. I would grow frustrated with it not fully embodying me and then decide I didn't need to re-design it and the cycle would start again.</p>\n<p>Well, I wanted to break the cycle so I did. Instead of making the site some personal horcrux indicative of my most personal self, I wrote down what I wanted to achieve with it, what it needed to do and highlight and then I spun up Astro and started building it on a Monday and launched it by Wednesday.</p>\n<p>All around less than 36 hours spent on it.<br />\nDid I launch it and forget about to add some links? Yes.<br />\nIs the code perfect? No, of course not (also don't ever give someone an unsolicited code review on Twitter. It's rude.)<br />\nIs everything I want to feature on there, featured? No.</p>\n<p>But this is the joy of launching quickly and iterating. The site is live and covers the necessities of what I wanted it to do for me. I don't have an entire project waiting to be launched.</p>\n<p>Now I can incrementally update and improve and refactor (there is quite a bit of CSS I realized I could have re-used and know I can clean up).</p>\n<p>And I'm happy with it. It looks better than it did in my opinion and has more structure and hierarchy than the old one. The grid is clean. My design fundamentals are showcased. The core things I wanted to highlight are highlighted.</p>\n<p>And now to keep building.</p>\n<p>An Instagram reel came across my feed in which a woman is telling a story about a photography professor who divides his class into two groups. One group is instructed to submit 100 photos over the quarter and the other group is instructed to submit one perfect photo.</p>\n<p>The group that is instructed to submit 100 photos gets better because they start right away and start taking photos and learn about composition. While the other group doesn't get better because they hem and haw over what a perfect photo is.</p>\n<p>You get better by doing. So go do. Go build. And iterate.</p>\n<p>September 3 Edit: the re-designed website lives <a href=\"https://stephaniestimac.com/\">here</a></p>\n<p>x Steph</p>",

    "title": "On Gatekeeping Design and Democratizing Information",
    "partialText": "<p>I was getting ready to fly to Denmark last week with my (now) husband when I was reading a LinkedIn thread that was unfolding on a post about my book <em>Design for Developers</em>. The comment was from a UX professional declaring she just didn’t understand books like mine, and it was a detriment to UX professionals everywhere that I democratize and demystify design and user experience for developers.</p>\n<p>I stopped checking after another design director went on to lash out and call me a clown. All over a book that wants to help developers learn about design so they can make their side projects look better and be better partners to the designers they work with?</p>\n<p>I have encountered ego and gatekeeping tendencies often in the design world and the belief that you’re just inherently born with an eye for design is wrong – it can be taught. As can user experience skills. And while designers sit and moan over the fact they wish their developers understood design better so they can be a better team, you can’t turn around and decry the democratization of the fundamental skills developers need to be a better partner to design.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want devs in my UX work” – well they most likely don’t want to be doing your work either but devs are building YOUR work. Code is user experience, and no one wants to be talked down to whether you’re a designer trying to understand code or a developer trying to understand design and user experience. Successful collaboration comes from a place where all parties have respect for each other and can communicate effectively.</p>\n<p>One of my most cherished career moments from the past year comes from an afternoon meeting when myself (as product manager), my lead engineer and my lead designer all sat in a room together and worked through some design and user experience problems for our VS Code application. We all came away with a plan that everyone was on board with. Technical difficulties were discussed as well as technical limitations with the design. Joy isn’t the right word, but how excited we all were about our plan was a palpable feeling in the room.</p>\n<p>That is the feeling I want to spread to other conference room and zoom calls. Shared success.  Not the antiquated process of design secretively working and then tossing a design over to devs like it’s the gospel truth.</p>\n<p>Code is not a separate thing from user experience. Without devs, there would be no digital UX to improve. We are all a team and we should be able to communicate effectively.</p>\n<p>I’m a designer first and foremost. I am also a product manager, and I am a hobby coder with a rich understanding of the web platform and developer tooling. Developers told me throughout my career they wanted to be able to design better and I wrote a book to solve that need.</p>\n<p>Why are we not afraid to say designers should learn to code, but are afraid to say developers should learn design? Perhaps gatekeeping is just a fear of our own insecurities, externalized. Otherwise I’ll take the compliment that my book is so well written, developers will start taking UX jobs after reading it. That is not the book’s intent but it seems to be a concern.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, people are going to continue to further their skills. While you’re concerned with people trying to better themselves in ways they find interesting that makes them better at their chosen career path, you will find that your fear of becoming stagnant or extinct has been realized. Not by anyone else’s doing but your own.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to join 1500 others in understanding the fundamentals of design and user experience, you can find my book Design for Developers on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Pnyxa5\">Amazon</a> or on <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers?utm_source=stimac&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=book_stimac_design_4_19_22&amp;a_aid=stimac&amp;a_bid=5f6ba095&amp;experiment=A\">Manning</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://toot.cafe/@seaotta\">Mastodon</a>, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://instagram.com/\">Instagram</a> and yes I'm on Threads too.

    "title": "Instagram killed creativity with the removal of recent hashtags",
    "partialText": "<p>Instagram had been testing out removing the ability to see recent posts under hash tags for about a year. They thought removing access to recent posts under hash tags and only bubbling up top content would help people discover more content better suited to them. As product manager, I call bs and I believe their data to move ahead with this decision was wrong.</p>\n<p>Th head of Instagram, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1459tbw/mosseri_addresses_the_removal_of_the_recent/\">was recorded in a live video</a> saying that the recent hashtags view was a vector for spam and abuse and it was removed for the safety of users. Sacrificing one of the most useful tools in the app for discovering new content to combat spam seems like a cop-out. &quot;We don't know how to solve this problem so we'll just remove it.&quot; The solutions most beneficial to your users may not be the most straightforward and easiest. You need to balance that with ensuring you're building a product people love. So how has this update killed creativity?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-update-that-killed-creativity-and-drives-homogeneity\">The update that killed creativity and drives homogeneity <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/9/instagram-killed-creativity/#the-update-that-killed-creativity-and-drives-homogeneity\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I can no longer find smaller accounts using niche hashtags. I enjoyed looking for accounts in style niches that aren't remnants of the big blogging era. This content isn't being served up to me. I follow some hashtags, but I never see posts from them anymore in my feed.</p>\n<p>Small creators and artists now need to vie for a spot in the extremely limited top posts showed under a hashtag. They start copying what big accounts are doing. Same style, same vibe, same trend. Sometimes it might work and if you posted a reel, it gets picked up.</p>\n<p>And now an environment is created where up and coming unique voices are forced into a pattern of content to keep their account relevant. We end up with thousands of reels following the same pattern. We end up with people focusing on hacks to increase reel views and then sharing those hacks as reels.</p>\n<p>Instagram killed discoverability and insists the change was to serve more relevant and recent content into our feeds. Maybe I would believe that if my explore page didn't serve up the same content from 6 months ago. I seem to get a mix of &quot;posted 5 days ago&quot; and &quot;posted 6 months ago&quot;...and the amount of accounts with under 10,000 followers showing up in that explore page is much less than those with over 10,000 followers.</p>\n<p>I don't judge anyone using the tips and tricks to get their content shown more. It just sucks it's to a point where thousands of creators feel like they have to hack the system to do so. They have to create content that conforms to a pattern that worked for other people, and might work for them but no guarantee, so just throw another reel on the pile that looks like everyone else's.</p>\n<p>Pessimistically, I believe the app promotes homogeneity, based on the reel formulas I see creators using. They are all the same, and it's not the fault of creators. It's the fault of the product itself.</p>\n<p>More often that not it's the fault of the need for unlimited growth, whether it's news users or monthly recurring revenue. I suspect some poor product manager is doing what they have to do to drive more people to pay to play.</p>\n<p>Not everyone wants to pay though. One of the reasons we might post to social media is to share with the world, in hopes of finding like-minded people, not necessarily to sell anything. How do we find those like-minded people if we only see what an app forces us to see instead of discovering it organically?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately Instagram isn't the only one suffering from this. Twitter is awash with tweet formulas that have been become synonymous with grift and little value, but the formula brings in high engagement.</p>\n<p>Rinse. Repeat. And the cycle goes on and on.</p>\n<p>Edit: After posting this, I came across a blog post from <a href=\"https://olu.online/about/\">Olu</a>, titled &quot;Bump, boost&quot; about mass social media and engagement.

    "partialText": "<p>The past few days have been incredibly stressful for me with more bureaucratic processes and paperwork. I can feel the stress sitting in my body despite my morning routine of yoga.</p>\n<p>It's a necessary bureaucratic process that is now nearly complete (hooray!) but the stress is likely also coming from not being able to spend time working on other things because I'm so worn out by the end of the day. (Also the Arizona heat, despite cooling down to highs of 85F, is really terrible for me and sleeping well.)</p>\n<p>There are side projects calling my name, ones I really want to work on (hullo Neu CSS Tricks). I'm in the process of updating my resume to be tailored more toward the two careers I'm targeting. Everything is in process and nothing is done and that's not a terribly good feeling with the year I've had.</p>\n<p>I've been falling back to explore my roots in design because my portfolio is sparse due to focusing on product management the last few years. I've been enjoying working with freelance clients the past few months and enjoy having a creative outlet again.</p>\n<p>But my imposter syndrome is rearing its ugly, terrible head as I relearn how to use my design muscles. And everything is in progress and nothing is done. In the case, there's nothing I can show, nothing I can add to a portfolio.</p>\n<p>There's this anxious energy driving me from within because I want to create, but not with code, not right now. I want to design. &quot;I can still design, I'm still a designer!&quot;</p>\n<p>A product manager with design skills or a designer with product management skills? Does it matter? I'm not sure, but I just need to design something to squash the imposter syndrome gnawing at my insecurities in my job search.</p>\n<p>A Bedfordshire Clanger enters the chat. I don't know why. But this is where my mind goes.</p>\n<p>It's a speciality pastry made in Bedforshire, dating back to the 19th century. Jhey's mentioned it to me and the last time we drove by the bakery on the High Street in Bedford, I saw that it had closed. &quot;Home of the Bedfordshire Clanger&quot; it said on the window. This is what I want to design a logo for. A badge. Logotype. Identity.</p>\n<p>Something different from all the developer focused stuff. Something to remind me, that I can design. That I'm capable of working with type and color. And it just sounds cool. Something worthy of its own logo.</p>\n<p>I want something that feels a little but old style but still modern, and fueled by imposter syndrome I start designing. It's a relief when I get the fourth one done. It's a quick exercise. And I can feel a little bit of stress leave my body. It's a first pass but...hey I can still design. I have something that's done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/bedfordshire-clanger.webp\" alt=\"alt: Four variations of a logo for a Bedfordshire Clanger. The logos all have a variation of the same phrase - Traditional Bedfordshire Clanger, Since 1800.\" /></p>\n<p>I don't have my printmaking supplies. I don't have my art box. I have a pen, a notebook and a laptop with Adobe Creative Suite though and that's enough to get rid of this creative energy and shoo the imposter syndrome away.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you just need to get something out and on paper, on a screen, just out so you can go dive deep on other things.</p>\n<p>In a year where I didn't get to see many of the projects in progress for my products at Rapid reach production (because layoffs), I want to see something done.</p>\n<p>Even if it's a logo for an English pastry that reminds me, &quot;hey, you can design.&quot;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://toot.cafe/@seaotta\">Mastodon</a>, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://instagram.com/\">Instagram</a> and yes I'm on Threads too.

    "partialText": "<p>I've been deep in a creation hole since the middle of August. I was accepted into Amazon's Merch on Demand program so I've been figuring out the ins and outs of this platform for selling designs.<br />\nIt's also led me down a rabbit hole of researching and designing across multiple platforms that sell products or are focused on content (e.g. social media).</p>\n<p>There are so many avenues to create content, monetize content or create products to sell in 2023. The way technology is enabling people to run their own business is pretty cool to see. Ease of access means more and more people are creating content and products.</p>\n<p>Social media platforms are overflowing with people trying to hustle and get their content seen, and Amazon and even Etsy are currently overflowing with print-on-demand products.</p>\n<p>No matter how you may feel about POD, I think it's pretty cool that there's a pretty easy way to create your own merch and sell it. POD has opened up an avenue for people to leverage their creative skills even further.</p>\n<p>But opening up a shop, creating content or using a platform like Merch On Demand isn't enough for success. You've got to have a market for what you want to sell AND you have to know how to write a listing to target what people are searching for.  The same goes for content whether it's on social media or your blog.</p>\n<p>My number one takeaway from everything I've been watching, reading and researching is that SEO is king in a world drowning in content. Can you identify your market and write in a way that surfaces your content/product/whatever to your audience?</p>\n<p>It's not just about Google ranking, but it's about keywords in your posts so people can find your content. I've heard people say Pinterest isn't a social media platform, it's a search engine. Instagram seems to be going this way too. Etsy, Amazon, eBay...they're marketplaces but leveraging keywords and phrases is a key to success. It's not the only key to success but it sure is damn important.</p>\n<p>I'm now asking myself three questions when I'm creating.</p>\n<p>Who is your audience?<br />\nWhat are they searching for?<br />\nWhat is micro-niche you're targeting?</p>\n<p>The 3rd one is important because you can know, for example, you're targeting web developers and know they're searching for developer tooling. There's tons of content out on the web on the general topic. So you need to find out what kind of developer tooling they're searching for.</p>\n<p>This is your niche within the topic.

    "title": "When to use CSS text-wrap: balance; vs text-wrap: pretty;",
    "partialText": "<p>At the start of the year I had written about how I wanted to spend this year writing about new CSS features landing in browsers. Life happened and it was in my best interest to do things off the web and away from my computer. But I'm picking this back up again because I'm genuinely back in a space to be exploring and creating things again. I wanted to start this little post off like this for anyone else who is struggling with burnout. It's okay to take a break. It's beneficial for your brain and the rest of you. Side projects will always be there to work on.</p>\n<p>Now onto good ol' text-wrap.</p>\n<p>I was looking into <code>text-wrap</code> and doing some research on the difference between when to use <code>balance</code> and when to use <code>pretty</code> (both are still experimental, but available in Chrome, Edge and Opera.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"text-wrap%3A-balance%3B\">text-wrap: balance; <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/10/css-text-wrap/#text-wrap%3A-balance%3B\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There is a limit on the number of lines that <code>text-wrap: balance;</code> will apply to <em>but</em> it is dependent on how many lines there are based on the width of your text. <code>Balance</code> will only apply to less than six lines.</p>\n<p>In the demo below, if you open the code on Codepen in a supported browser, remove <code>text-wrap</code> while the width is 300px, you'll see <code>text-wrap</code> has no effect. If you change the width to 600px, add <code>text-wrap: balance;</code> back to the CSS - you'll see it does have an effect.</p>\n<div class=\"codepen-container\">\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-slug-hash=\"GRPzVLN\" data-user=\"seaotta\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/seaotta/pen/GRPzVLN\">\n  CSS Text Wrap: Balance Limit</a> by Stephanie Stimac 🔮 (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/seaotta\">@seaotta</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p>With <code>text-wrap: balance;</code>, because there's a limit to how many lines the browser will wrap, this should only be used on headlines, headings, and subheadings. Applying it to large paragraphs will have no effect and comes at a performance cost because the browser is trying to calculate optimal balance even though it won't apply anything.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/text-wrap/balance.png\" alt=\"alt: A comparison of a heading with text-wrap balance applied vs not applied. One heading is optically balanced. The other is not with two short words that wrap to the second line of the heading. \" /></p>\n<p>The example above shows a comparison of a headline without balance applied and a headline with it applied. The first example doesn't look balanced, whereas the second one does.</p>\n<h2 id=\"text-wrap%3A-pretty%3B\">text-wrap: pretty; <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/10/css-text-wrap/#text-wrap%3A-pretty%3B\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Text wrap <code>pretty</code> is the opposite of <code>balance</code> and can be used on entire blocks of text but you're only really going to see a difference on the last four lines of text. It's primary use is to prevent orphans - or one word - on their own line.</p>\n<p>The browser makes calculations to make adjustments for you. &quot;To balance between the typographic benefits and the performance impacts, it adjusts the last 4 lines of paragraphs that meet certain conditions.&quot; <a href=\"https://chromestatus.com/feature/5145771917180928\">Chrome Platform Status</a>.</p>\n<p>The differences are subtle when <code>text-wrap: pretty;</code> is applied.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/text-wrap/pretty.png\" alt=\"alt: A comparison of paragraphs of text. One has text-wrap pretty applied to it and one does not. The one with text-wrap pretty has two words on the last line and the one without only has one word on the last line, an orphan.\" />.</p>\n<p>In the image above, the paragraph on the left does not have <code>pretty</code> applied and there is one word on the last line. In the paragraph on the right, with <code>text-wrap: pretty;</code> applied, there are two words on the last line and you can see the slight adjustments to the last three lines to make that second word wrap.</p>\n<p>Very subtle, but it provides a solution to avoid any hacks around trying to get rid of those orphan words that visually look out of place on their own line.</p>\n<p>Support for <code>pretty</code> is again quite sparse, with only Chromium browser support. Hopefully Firefox and Safari will ship these to help improve typography on the web.</p>\n<h2 id=\"balance-and-pretty\">Balance and Pretty <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/10/css-text-wrap/#balance-and-pretty\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Use <code>text-wrap: balance;</code> on headings and subheadings. And use <code>text-wrap: pretty;</code> on paragraphs of text to get rid of orphans on the last line. Despite the Chromium-only support, these would be a good candidate for progressive enhancement. It won't negatively affect the experience if someone is not in a supported browser, but it will some visual balance to the page for those in a browser where supported.</p>\n<p>Here's the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap\">link out to MDN for text-wrap</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://toot.cafe/@seaotta\">Mastodon</a>, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://instagram.com/\">Instagram</a> and yes I'm on Threads too.

    "partialText": "<p>I love a bougie experience. A nice hotel, a nice restaurant. But I also love a grueling hike that leads to some truly stunning nature that isn't accessible to many people. Growing up in Washington and spending the last 16 years in Bellingham and Seattle placed me in the midst of premium access to some of the best nature.</p>\n<p>I particularly love harsh landscapes. Iceland and the Scottish Highlands are some of my favorite places to have visited. I like feeling small in the midst of some overwhelmingly barren landscape. It readjusts my perspective.</p>\n<p>My dad booked a weekend away for me, my mom and him in the Grand Canyon. October has been a particularly difficult month for multiple reasons and this was supposed to be a way to get us all out of the house.</p>\n<p>We took the train from Williams, AZ and spent the night at one of the lodges in the national park. It was a nice and chill ride up to the canyon. We were in one of the dome cars where you sit up top and have a view all around. As part of the package that was booked, there was a sunset tour that took you along points along the east of the South Rim from the train depot drop off.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/grand-canyon.webp\" alt=\"alt: Looking down into the Grand Canyon from the South Rim Pima Point.\" /></p>\n<p>On our way back to the lodge, after sunset, we were met with a full moon rising over the canyon and that felt particularly special. It wasn't planned and here I get to watch the most stunning moonrise over a most stunning and sacred landscape. Photos don't do it just but I tried.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/2023/grand-canyon-2.webp\" alt=\"alt: A full moon rises over the Grand Canyon. The Canyon walls look pink.\" /></p>\n<p>While I didn't get to properly hike, we did walk the paved South Rim trail from Mather Point to Bright Angel. I walked a little ways down Bright Angel just to say I went into the canyon but I want to come back one day and hike properly down into it.</p>\n<p>After a ridiculously stressful month it was nice to reset in such grand scenery. I tried to be as present as possible and realized that getting out into nature is a priority for me. Not just a walk to the park, which is just as important, but actually getting out where your cell phone signal is half what it normally is.</p>\n<p>I need that moment to step away from a screen and be consumed by the natural world for a little bit. So as I get ready to settle into life in the UK, this is something that becomes a priority for me and I am looking forward to 2024 and finding places to hike around Britain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://toot.cafe/@seaotta\">Mastodon</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaotta\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://instagram.com/seaotta\">Instagram</a>, or <a href=\"https://webwitchweekly.beehiiv.com/\">Subscribe to my newsletter</a>.</p>\n<p>Author of <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers?utm_source=stimac&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=book_stimac_design_4_19_22&amp;a_aid=stimac&amp;a_bid=5f6ba095\">Design for Developers</a> &amp; owner of <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/webwitchinc\">WebWitchInc</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>11 months ago I packed up my life and moved across the world to Berlin for work. I left my job at Microsoft in May 2022 because I knew the question of &quot;what if I moved to Europe?&quot; would haunt me until the day I died. I talked through such a huge life change frequently with my therapist. With the way I operate and my anxiety, we frequently discussed a plan b.</p>\n<p>Seattle would always be there. My friends at my hangout in West Seattle would remind me, we'll be here when you need a dose of home.</p>\n<p>So I moved to Berlin with 4 suitcases, ready to be in the same timezone as my team at Rapid. Four months later we all got laid off.</p>\n<p>Well then.</p>\n<p>You think in those moments that your anxiety would taunt you, &quot;the actual WORST THING happened, you were right! You were right!&quot; But it doesn't. At least not for me. I have experienced some things that would seriously make a killer memoir, and I've survived each of those experiences.</p>\n<p>The important thing is, you figure it out.</p>\n<p>All of this to say, I have not had a place to call my own since January. I have been floating through time and space the past 11 months, lucky to have the support network to allow me to do so until I figured out what was next. (Even my place in Berlin wasn't &quot;mine&quot; - it was a short term furnished apartment.)</p>\n<p>This weekend I will get to decorate for Christmas with my husband. We get to start working on remodeling. And I get to collapse in a cozy heap of blankets with a kebab at home and rest. This sprint is done.</p>\n<p>There's more to come, but for the first time in 11 months, I will be home without a time limit hanging over my head.</p>\n<p>England is now officially home.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>Chrome 120 was released last week and in this version, we got the CSS Media Query for scripting support. Simply, this media query allows you to test whether scripting language are available and tailor page content and styles depending on support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"media-query-syntax\">Media query syntax <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/12/css-media-query-scripting/#media-query-syntax\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are three values to choose from for the media query: <code>none</code>, <code>initial-only</code>, and <code>enabled</code>.</p>\n<p>The value <code>none</code> means that the user agent won't run scripts for the current document, either because it doesn't support it or support isn't active for scripting.</p>\n<p>The value <code>initial-only</code> means that scripting is available during the initial page load, but not after.</p>\n<p>The value <code>enabled</code> means scripting is supported and active for the current document and the &quot;lifetime&quot; of the document.</p>\n<h3 id=\"code-example\">Code Example <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/12/css-media-query-scripting/#code-example\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The CSS media query means you can change the styling and content of the page based on a class name. You could have three different sets of content built out in your HTML, and depending on the status of scripting you can show one of those content sets while hiding the other two.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;no-scripting&quot;&gt;\nNo scripting so here's a specific set of content and styles \n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n@media (scripting: none) {\n    .no-scripting {\n        display: flex;\n        color: green;\n    }\n\n    .initial-scripting {\n        display: none;\n    }\n\n    .full-scripting {\n        display: none:\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"support\">Support <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/12/css-media-query-scripting/#support\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The CSS media query for scripting support is available in Chrome as of November 29, 2023, and was already available in Firefox and Safari (both released earlier this year in May and September, respectively). Support is coming in Microsoft Edge and Opera, where the feature is currently in preview. There is no apparent signal from Samsung Internet, with no support at all for the feature.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\">Closing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2023/12/css-media-query-scripting/#closing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This seems like a pretty great feature for progressive enhancement even at the most basic level. You can ensure your users who have JavaScript support disabled get a good experience fairly easily.  With nearly full major browser support, this is a great addition to the web platform.</p>\n<p>Happy coding!</p>\n<p>Edit after publishing: There is indeed a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag, but the intention with this media query &quot;isn't to replace noscript. Its just to allow you to style elements based on the script state.&quot; - <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1467097\">Source Link</a></p>",

I ended up reading many 700+ page fantasy books this year so when I average that out, that's nearly 3 &quot;normal&quot; books.</p>\n<p>I didn't read as many educational or historical books this year. I was largely in an escapist mood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"most-unique-read%3A-wild%3A-tales-from-early-medieval-britain-by-amy-jeffs\">Most unique read: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/47iPM3t\"><em>Wild: Tales from Early Medieval Britain</em></a> by Amy Jeffs <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/2023-books/#most-unique-read%3A-wild%3A-tales-from-early-medieval-britain-by-amy-jeffs\">#</a></h2>\n<p>When I picked this up in a London bookshop I thought it was a historical account of early Britain, and in a way it is. The English Literature student in me found a bit of a refreshing change though, and while the book takes poems and stories from early Britain, the author provides a follow up essay for each one. Breaking it down, reflecting on the circumstances and period when the piece was written. Nature and the wild are the underlying themes of the stories shared. It took me back to my school days when we would have to write papers, analyzing a work.</p>\n<p>A different kind of book, for those who love art and nature.</p>\n<h2 id=\"best-story%3A-the-way-of-kings%3A-the-stormlight-archive-by-brandon-sanderson\">Best story: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NOQLSa\"><em>The Way of Kings: The Stormlight Archive</em></a> by Brandon Sanderson <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/2023-books/#best-story%3A-the-way-of-kings%3A-the-stormlight-archive-by-brandon-sanderson\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Craving a new fantasy adventure, I finally started a Brandon Sanderson series, <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>, and after a bit of a slow start, was immediately hooked. <em>The Wheel of Time</em> has been my big fantasy series I didn't want to let go of, with a fear I'd be disappointed by other series. Well, I'm not disappointed except for the fact there's only 4 books out of the 10 planned (number 5 is set to arrive in 2024!)</p>\n<h2 id=\"most-helpful%3A-the-gifts-of-imperfection-by-bren%C3%A9-brown\">Most helpful: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3O9UIB9\"><em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em></a> by Brené Brown <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/2023-books/#most-helpful%3A-the-gifts-of-imperfection-by-bren%C3%A9-brown\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A great and short read about authenticity and staying true to yourself.

I started the Outlander series once again and am just getting through the last two books published in the series. I hadn't read them yet (not on this list). The Wheel of Time has been a joy to rediscover in audiobook form. So many new things I pick up on in this form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Words of Radiance, Stormlight Archive #2</li>\n<li>Oathbringer, Stormlight Archive #3</li>\n<li>Running on Red Dog Road: And Other Perils of an Appalachian Childhood</li>\n<li>Your Best Year Ever</li>\n<li>Time-Blocking: Your Method to Supercharge Productivity &amp; Reach Your Goal</li>\n<li>Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone</li>\n<li>Sapiens, A Brief History of Humankind</li>\n<li>This Is How You Lose the Time War</li>\n<li>Outlander (Book 1)</li>\n<li>Dragonfly in Amber (Book 2)</li>\n<li>Voyager (Book 3)</li>\n<li>Drums of Autumn (Book 4)</li>\n<li>The Fiery Cross (Book 5)</li>\n<li>A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Book 6)</li>\n<li>An Echo in the Bone (Book 7)</li>\n<li>The Eye of the World (WoT Book 1)</li>\n<li>The Great Hunt (WoT Book 2)</li>\n<li>The Dragon Reborn (WoT Book 3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These can all be found in my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/seaotta/list/HESZSFHH7HMV?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_aipsflist_aipsfseaotta_KJ21J9WKC49GN3YTNBS7\">Amazon list</a>.</p>\n<p>My goal for 2024 is 30 books. &quot;But you didn't even reach your goal for 2023!&quot; you might say. I want prioritize reading more and less scrolling. The last few weeks of the year there has been too much scrolling. Upping the goal helps kick me into gear.</p>\n<p>A gentle reminder I'd like to leave you with: reading is meant to be enjoyed. It's okay to abandon a book that isn't keeping your attention and move onto something different. Enjoy the read, don't force it.</p>\n<p>Happy 2024.</p>",

I'm also going through this with my <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/VoguesMoon\">Etsy shop</a> right now. Do I keep the name with sentimental meaning or do I switch it up?</p>\n<p>And then all I can think of are the countless code names for projects in my past careers and the jokes about names and naming things. How terrible it is to try and name things. One of my favorite projects <a href=\"https://webhint.io/\">webhint.io</a> went through 3 name changes after we launched.</p>\n<p>And let's not even talk about deciding on a name and then going to buy a URL for your thing.

    "title": "Surviving layoffs in tech",
    "partialText": "<p>We've started the new year and the layoff news just keeps hitting. In April 2023, I was laid off from my product management role that I had just relocated to Berlin for, barely 4 months earlier. I'm still in the process of interviewing for a role. I did have some life things to sort through during this time that made applying to roles really difficult so I had some very limited criteria when the time came. Here's a few things that have helped me through the last 9 to 10 months.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-a-brief-break\">Take a brief break <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/surviving-layoffs/#take-a-brief-break\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The immediate pressure to start looking and applying for new roles is going to be intense. Take a day, take a week, or take a longer period of time to settle your mind. For me, I tried jumping back in and quickly realized I just wasn't in the right headspace to interview. My confidence was shot and I was exhausted. This will also help you ensure you're clear about where you want to go next. It's 100% okay to take a break.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what's-the-plan%3F\">What's the plan? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/surviving-layoffs/#what's-the-plan%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Get clear on your plan, your goals, and what's important to you. If you have a partner, talk through your plans and get clear on what it is you want to be doing. Whether it's taking an extended break, pivoting to a new career path, wanting to spend more time on hobbies...have a plan. I've struggled with not having a full-time gig at times. I would have a full on anxiety attack and a combination of remembering what the plan is and having a wildly supportive husband has been key. Having a north star to reorient yourself can be helpful. It's also a great time to figure out what it is you want in your next role. What kind of company values are important? What kind of work? Figuring this out so you can be strategic about where you apply helps the process and gives purpose to applying.</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-sure-you-take-care-of-you\">Make sure you take care of you <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/surviving-layoffs/#make-sure-you-take-care-of-you\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Job hunting right now is overwhelming. There have been so many tech layoffs and seeing a position you want to apply for on LinkedIn with 900+ applications is disheartening. I've never submitted so many applications and had so many interviews before. It is rough right now. Job hunting is a full time job but if you start to get overwhelmed - take a break and chill from applying for a day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-your-network\">Use your network <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/surviving-layoffs/#use-your-network\">#</a></h2>\n<p>My most successful interactions have been with tapping into my network and getting a referral. Don't be afraid to ask for help. I don't like feeling like a burden but my close network wants to help me succeed. Ask for help!</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-outside\">Get outside <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/surviving-layoffs/#get-outside\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Remember to step away from the screen. Go for a walk - it really actually does help.</p>\n<p>Be kind to yourself. You aren't a bad person because you were laid off, and I truly and fully believe something better comes next. But you need to take care of you first!</p>",

It would probably be suitable to retain the current behavior if you know that the text length of whatever is being input will be between certain character lengths that don't get cut off.</p>\n<p><code>field-sizing: content;</code> will disable the current behavior and allow the form size to adjust depending on the content.</p>\n<p>One pain point to note with this is, if you're using <code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;</code>, you will want to put a min and max-width on the element...otherwise it looks like you could just expand forever horizontally, which in itself wouldn't be a great user experience.</p>\n<p>Expanding vertically with <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> though, does create a much better experience especially on smaller screens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"code-example\">Code example <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/01/css-field-sizing/#code-example\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This feature is in Developer Trial behind a flag (Experimental Web Platform features) - in Chrome &amp; Microsoft Edge and is expected to be shipping in Chrome 123 (but Chrome Status hasn't been updated to reflect whether this is actually true or not.)</p>\n<p>Open up Canary or Dev browser channels (I'm using Edge Canary), ensure your experimental flag is turned on, and check out the codepen below by adding content to the inputs.

    "partialText": "<p>After my first two weeks at Igalia, while everything is new, it also feels as if I've come back home after 2 years away from the web platform space.</p>\n<p>There is so much new information about web platform projects to digest and I've been slowly figuring out how things work around here.</p>\n<p>Igalia is a flat structure cooperative, which is really cool, but also really new to me and also feels incredibly empowering. In case you don't know what Igalia does, <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/\">we're an open source consultancy</a>. Meaning you can hire us to build stuff for the web platform (and many other areas).</p>\n<p>You know CSS Grid? That piece of layout that changed the way we build websites? <a href=\"https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2017/03/16/css-grid-layout-is-here-to-stay/\">Igalia led the role</a> in the development of that.</p>\n<p>So for so many reasons I'm excited to be here. I spent almost 7 years on the Microsoft Edge web platform team and then later developer experiences. I have a little bit of insight into how browser features get prioritized and there often are not enough people to prioritize features that don't add immediate business value to the rest of the browser company. Igalia solves that problem and those features that companies want implemented end up benefiting developers everywhere. Again, look at CSS Grid.</p>\n<p>I have had some really interesting conversations with <a href=\"https://toot.cafe/@bkardell\">Brian Kardell</a> about big problems like how <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/HowWeFund.html\">we currently fund the web ecosystem</a> and the wheels are spinning on how to turn this into a conference talk.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resurrecting-the-web-we-want\">Resurrecting the Web We Want <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/03/first-week-igalia/#resurrecting-the-web-we-want\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I've also been thinking about the <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/\">Web We Want</a> project. I had wanted to stay involved when I left Microsoft but it became too much and though our committee still meets, it's effectively on pause.</p>\n<p>I want to give the site a visual refresh and I have a few other strategic ideas swirling around. It is a valuable resource of developer wants for the web platform and DevTools and I want it to continue on. Now that I'm back in the web platform, I want to breathe some new life into this project and believe it's incredibly important developers are heard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-i'll-be-working-on\">What I'll be working on <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/03/first-week-igalia/#what-i'll-be-working-on\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm a web platform PM so I get to help drive all sorts of work. I'm excited to dive into <a href=\"https://servo.org/\">Servo</a>, a modern memory safe browser built on Rust, and <a href=\"https://wolvic.com/en/\">Wolvic</a>, Igalia's open source browser for XR.</p>\n<p>While I'm be primarily focused on the PM side of projects, I'm also looking forward to dipping my toes back into developer comms and marketing/advocacy work.</p>\n<p>Good stuff all around.

    "title": "The Curious Case of the CSS Monochrome Media Query",
    "partialText": "<p>I make a habit of browsing web platform features to see what's new and interesting and moving along in the browser space. It also leads to discovering things that have been around a while that I haven't heard of before.</p>\n<p>In one such instance, this is how I discovered <code>@media(monochrome)</code>. I found this media query particularly relevant with what seems to be an onslaught of e-ink devices making their way into the market. Someone tweeted about their <a href=\"https://shop.boox.com/products/palma\">Boox Palma</a>, and it seems in this instance, a media query to target monochrome UI just makes sense.</p>\n<p>I tried testing the monochrome media query on my Kindle browser with this <a href=\"https://stephaniestimac.com/demos/monochrome/\">quick demo*</a>. If the device is monochrome, that message should change to say your device supports monochrome.</p>\n<p>My Kindle didn't though. It said it wasn't a monochrome device which is obviously wrong and boils down to the browser. (<a href=\"https://www.quirksmode.org/css/mediaqueries/color.html\">This person also tried the same on their Kindle and got the same result</a>).</p>\n<p>I don't know what browser my Kindle has, though the device is at least 4 years old and no more than 5. Googling brought up some obscure Stack Overflow threads about the Kindle browser not being modern enough to support media queries. But according to <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/\">caniuse.com</a>, this feature was supported as far back as Chrome version 4.</p>\n<p>Curious.</p>\n<p>In 2022, a WebKit bug that had been opened <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112549\">since 2013</a> was fixed. This must have relevance somewhere in order to make a fix to match the spec.</p>\n<p>But there is very little information on it otherwise. A few mentions of using it for print layouts, but there's a media query to target print layouts already. Most sites that have posted about it are just regurgitating the very minimal information the spec provides.</p>\n<p>Does it even actually work as intended? There doesn't seem to be a way to test without a monochrome device. But which types of monochrome devices it supports isn't documented anywhere.</p>\n<p>In theory, it seems like it would be the perfect CSS feature to provide designs tailored to a monochrome device and these e-ink phones are slowly starting to appear. If you have an e-ink device with a modern browser and click the demo link I've shared above, I'd be much obliged to know which message you get.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*It was a very quick demo, and therefore it says &quot;dual screen device demo in the meta information so just ignore that please</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>When I was interviewing for a role with Microsoft Edge in early 2016, I got to my final interview in the loop and I can still remember sitting across from my soon-to-be manager when he asked about the future of the web.</p>\n<p>HoloLens had been announced, so I must have had that in my mind because I answered with a question.</p>\n<p>&quot;What if you could crawl into a web page?&quot; And began to describe what it would look like to crawl into a news article to be immersed in a visual representation of the story you were reading.</p>\n<p>I got the job and joined the land of browser work and discovered an entire career path that changed my life. I didn't do anything with browsers in VR while I was at Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Eight years later, I powered on a Meta Quest 3 in my little home office, fumbled through the setup, downloaded Igalia's open source browser Wolvic and crawled in a browser. Jhey was outside when I was suddenly immersed in a browser cityscape and very loudly exclaimed, &quot;holy shit&quot; and laughed.</p>\n<p>I entered an art exhibition and then crawled into a painting. Exploring art in the 3D. &quot;This is so cool.&quot; And that's what I kept repeating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hello-wolvic\">Hello Wolvic <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/05/browsing-the-web-vr/#hello-wolvic\">#</a></h2>\n<p>So, why exactly do I have an XR headset, and what does this have to do with your career? One of the projects I am slowly ramping up on at Igalia is <a href=\"https://wolvic.com/\">Wolvic</a>. Wolvic used to be Firefox Reality but Igalia took over stewardship of the project in 2022 and have been working on developing it since. It's the only open source browser available on several devices.</p>\n<p>From a product perspective, this is a really cool space for me to flex some product management chops and think about user growth and how to make getting started with Wolvic easier. Then there's the project management side of things and finding partnerships for companies interested in developing the browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-could-you-use-a-vr-headset-for%3F\">What could you use a VR headset for? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/05/browsing-the-web-vr/#what-could-you-use-a-vr-headset-for%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I was sharing my first experience with my friends and one of them works for a telecommunications company. &quot;I spend so much time in Google Earth exploring and drawing lines on maps between points. It would be pretty fun to do in VR.&quot;</p>\n<p>That sounds pretty practical to me. Being &quot;in&quot; a view is completely different from viewing something on your normal computer monitor.</p>\n<p>I'm pondering all the different use cases now, things I'd never thought of before. It's pretty cool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"immersed-in-the-web\">Immersed in the Web <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/05/browsing-the-web-vr/#immersed-in-the-web\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I am sure I will be blogging more about Wolvic and building an XR browser. I'm excited to explore this space...a space I imagined eight years ago. It feels a little full circle and that's pretty neat for me.</p>\n<p>Wolvic is Open Source &amp; if you're interested in helping to fund the project or use it, here are a few links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wolvic\">Open Collective for Wolvic XR</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wolvic.com/blog/\">Wolvic Blog</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can download Wolvic from the Meta App store. It's also available on Pico &amp; Huawei devices.</p>\n<p>If you're an XR developer, please let us know if you have any feedback for Wolvic. You can follow the project on <a href=\"https://github.com/Igalia/wolvic\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>More to come but for now I just wanted to say....this is SO freaking cool. Stay tuned for some posts and videos on YouTube.</p>",

The rather blunt truth of it is, hailing from Seattle, and now living in the UK, summers are sacred to me. I want to be able to enjoy time being outside in the sun because November-May is pretty bleak. There are exceptions, but I'm looking forward to the rest of July and August being event free. I've given three talks the past month, at Pixel Pioneers, Web Engines Hackfest and Web Summer Camp. They have all been lovely and have also helped me refocus on how/what types of talks I like to give.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-bits\">Other bits <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/07/life-check-no-1/#other-bits\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I've barely had time to read, workout or do yoga over the past month. The way things fell on the schedule for June made things hard. I'm expecting a bit more of the same in late September with so many life events happening. I feel a bit out of sorts, the routine out the window &amp; my gut is telling me my Hashimoto's is affecting me.</p>\n<p>Also, cheers to the IRS. I hired a third party to do my taxes. I owe them money but they won't accept my return until I verify my identity. Having done my UK taxes for the first time, let me say how absolutely ridiculous I now find the US tax system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"design-for-developers\">Design for Developers <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/07/life-check-no-1/#design-for-developers\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Available in 3 languages!

    "partialText": "<p>Everything is the same and yet everything is different. That's how I feel sitting on the edge of the water in West Seattle. I've not been living here since January 2023. I've been back 5 or 6 times in the last year and a half and suddenly the buildings that were steel bones and scaffolding are complete. New shops and hotels abound across the lake in Bellevue. When was the last time I was in Bellevue? I can't remember but the new shiny hotel with a Rolls Royce out front lures me in. Ultimately its the same old city built around a shopping mall.</p>\n<p>The skies are faintly hazy in that dreamy August way. The less dreamy reality of that haze means some idiot started a wild fire because the rules apply to everyone else but not them, because they're &quot;careful&quot; when starting a campfire during a campfire ban. Change all around but still the same.</p>\n<p>I don't have time for blues night at The Spot and each time I try to swing by for a coffee on my way to the bane of my existence (my storage unit), it's closed, which is very unlike the way things were. Blues night isn't even the same crew anymore. I go to Beacon Hill and have wine on the patio with two of my girlfriends and have a lovely moment.</p>\n<p>A week flies by, and I am once again sat in SeaTac, which is not immune to the progress and evolution around it. I am not headed home across the Atlantic, but to see my brother and my new niece who arrived 7 weeks early. I am tired. &quot;I really must stop trying to cram so much in during these trips&quot; I tell myself...again.</p>\n<p>But it's hard not to when everything is changing and new things are happening.</p>\n<p>It's strange to feel your love of place evolve and change as you witness the physicality of it also change. Not necessarily the nature, which is surely changing in a way not noticeable to the eye, but the hustle and bustle of people and human settlement. My love for Seattle remains rooted in its beauty &amp; nearness to the water.</p>\n<p>The air smells salty when I visit now, something I haven't noticed for well over a decade. I'm no longer acclimated, and yet Seattle still holds a tiny piece of my soul. A piece which is greatly calmed when I sit on the rocks of the shoreline in West Seattle.</p>",

I have not seen most of my friends since last November, so it was lovely. We paddle boarded in a glacier fed lake and also had floating charcuterie which we've now called &quot;lakecuterie&quot;...we're also wondering why this is the first time we'd thought of this incredible way to make a paddle board day more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>We spent the next day at the <a href=\"https://www.scandinave.com/whistler\">Scandinave Spa</a>. I was a bit worried about not being able to talk inside the spa but what ensued was the most blissful 5 hours of digital detox and relaxation time. I am now trying to ensure I have active digital detox time &amp; would like to regularly sauna/cold plunge. That combo is amazing for my nervous system.</p>\n<p>I then flew out to Pennsylvania for my brother's baby shower, however, their little one arrived 7 weeks early and in addition to the baby shower I got to meet my niece. I cried as I met her in the NICU and had a lovely moment with my brother. My sister and mom had flown out too, so it was a nice weekend, but I was tired &amp; by the time I got back to England, I was exhausted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"life-in-the-uk\">Life in the UK <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/09/life-check-no-2/#life-in-the-uk\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I'm driving a bit more and will have to take a driving test to get my UK license. I am not super stoked about it, honestly. Things I'd never thought I would have to do again. I don't do that much driving but as its football season and Jhey has weekend games, I'd like to take the pup on some adventures. My US license is only good until November here in the UK so...time to get to it.</p>\n<p>It's just the roundabouts man.

I attended Config 2024 and the display of wealth demonstrated through activities and freebies gave me pause. There was a festival-like atmosphere with DJs and food stalls that left me wondering what exactly this event cost.</p>\n<p>I'm not here to dictate how brands spend their money, but as I look at other corporate, product focused events of huge scale in which celebrities are asked to speak and/or comedians are hired for comedy hour (yes at a tech conference), I can't help but ponder the excessive displays of wealth happening at these events while layoffs have happened at many if not all of these companies.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, these product focused conferences are one big marketing campaign and I leave feeling a bit overwhelmed and asking &quot;what did I learn?&quot;</p>\n<p>Did I actually take anything away from any of the tracks? Well, no. Nothing actionable. I couldn't even get into any of the product management tracks at Config because they were booked full.</p>\n<p>But more and more, I see web and design focused product companies throwing events, and less and less I see local, grassroots meetups &amp; events. And this is disheartening for a number of reasons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"supporting-community-events\">Supporting community events <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/09/community-events/#supporting-community-events\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I look at what community events ask for in sponsorships, and often, merely a fraction of the budget spent on these large events could help support local community events.</p>\n<p>In a world after COVID lockdowns, local events are a whisper of what they used to be.</p>",

Most recently I've seen work being done to improve the customizability of the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements. More stylable accordions. Exciting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-%3Cdetails%3E-is-hard-to-work-with\">Why <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> is hard to work with <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/10/html-details-and-summary-update/#why-%3Cdetails%3E-is-hard-to-work-with\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element is a disclosure widget, which is a piece of UI that has a brief summary or heading and a control to expand the UI to show more details.</p>\n<p>When you use <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> however, you don't have a lot of control over customizing it (like a lot of HTML Controls). The little triangle to indicate whether it's open or closed is not easily replaced. Styling or customizing <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> just isn't easy, which in turn means developers end up building a custom component for their accordions.</p>\n<p>This ends up creating a lot of unnecessary work. Using existing HTML elements means you get all the security, accessibility and performance benefits that have already been baked in. The browser takes care of all that for you. Rebuilding from scratch means you've got to worry about adding all that back in, especially the accessibility bits.</p>\n<p>But you can't style it how you want to, so you end up building it from scratch anyway. Rinse. Repeat. A tale as old as time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"proposed-updates\">Proposed updates <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/10/html-details-and-summary-update/#proposed-updates\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There's quite a bit being proposed to help make <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> more customizable and interoperable between browsers (because no one likes it when browsers make things behave/display differently!)</p>\n<p>A few highlights:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove CSS <code>display</code> property restrictions so you can use other <code>display</code> types like flex &amp; grid.</li>\n<li>Specify the structure of the shadow tree more clearly (this helps with flex/grid).</li>\n<li>Add pseudo-elements to give access to more parts leading to more stylability</li>\n<li>Better ability to animate these elements through additional changes (these are a part of a separate work stream but will benefit these elements).</li>\n<li>Improve <code>::marker</code> styling</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The exciting news is items 1 &amp; 3 in the list above should be shipping in Chrome 131 Stable next week (first week of November 2024). This will bring a new <code>::details-content</code> pseudo-element to the web, allowing more access to parts of <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further-reading\">Further reading <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/10/html-details-and-summary-update/#further-reading\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dbaron/details-styling\"><em>Improvements to <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> styling</em></a> explainer_ by David Baron</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dbaron/details-styling/blob/main/phase-1.md\">Phase 1 proposal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1469418\">Chromium Bug</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1856374\">Mozilla Bug</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"a-nod-to-open-ui\">A Nod to Open UI <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/10/html-details-and-summary-update/#a-nod-to-open-ui\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Much of this work to improve form controls is started within the <a href=\"https://open-ui.org/\">Open UI</a> community group.

    "title": "Brief and practical tips for public speaking",
    "partialText": "<p>Six years ago the thought of standing on a stage to give a talk made me physically ill. Six years later and 30 times on stage giving a talk, it still actually does make me physically ill but not to such a severe degree that it did then.</p>\n<p>One of my friends is back in school and had to give a presentation to her professors, so she asked me for some tips. Also, in case anyone needs proof that you can overcome your fear of public speaking, I once dropped out of a class at the start of the semester in university because the thought of having to do the final presentation caused me such severe anxiety. Eek.</p>\n<p>Nerves are actually a good thing - it means you care. Lean into the nerves but also learn how to manage them. But there's also beta blockers if you really need the extra help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip%3A-practice-makes-perfect\">Tip: Practice Makes Perfect <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/11/public-speaking-tips/#tip%3A-practice-makes-perfect\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The first conference talk I gave was 20 minutes long. I wrote my talk and went through it every single day for 3-4 months up until the event. I don't do this length of preparation anymore, but I still practice my talk a few times before the main event.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It helps me find spots that don't flow well or have bumpy transitions.</li>\n<li>It helps me identify what part of my content I don't know well enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can never practice too many times in my opinion AND it's going to make your delivery more confident. Practice practice practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip%3A-use-speaker-notes\">Tip: Use Speaker Notes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/11/public-speaking-tips/#tip%3A-use-speaker-notes\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I sometimes feel like speaker notes are looked down upon. &quot;If you're a REAL speaker, you don't need notes&quot; - well, no. Stop right there. I use speaker notes in every one of my talks. I require them because my brain likes to play this fun trick on me when I get up on stage, and it completely blanks. Doesn't matter how many times I've practiced. It is the way my brain is wired and probably some anxiety response.</p>\n<p>I believe access to speaker notes is an accessibility issue too. If you were to only have people who can speak without access to their notes at your event - your pool of speakers is going to be so small and not diverse.</p>\n<p>Use your speaker notes to also remind yourself to slow down and breathe. You're probably speaking more quickly than you realize (me, always).</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip%3A-slow-down-and-breathe\">Tip: Slow down and breathe <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/11/public-speaking-tips/#tip%3A-slow-down-and-breathe\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What I said above. You are probably speaking faster than you realize, slow down, take a breath, take a pause. Instead of saying &quot;uhm&quot; - just take a breath instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip%3A-if-you-stumble%2C-don't-apologize\">Tip: If you stumble, don't apologize <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/11/public-speaking-tips/#tip%3A-if-you-stumble%2C-don't-apologize\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you stumble over your words, don't apologize for it and interrupt your own flow. The audience isn't going to remember if you just compose yourself and keep talking. I sometimes have difficulty saying words. If I have written a tongue twister, I sort of poke fun at myself and make an exasperated face while repeating what I meant to say. You're also human. We stumble over things sometimes. No need to apologize for being human on stage.</p>\n<p>No one is there waiting for you to fail or stumble (and if someone is, they can get in the bin). The audience is on your side and wants to see you succeed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tip%3A-ask-yourself-why-you're-nervous\">Tip: Ask yourself why you're nervous <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/11/public-speaking-tips/#tip%3A-ask-yourself-why-you're-nervous\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If I feel overly anxious, I always ask myself what is the worst that could happen? And then say to myself, ok and what are you going to do if that happens? And lead myself down a path &quot;and then what will you do after that?&quot; until my nerves have calmed down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pursuing-speaking\">Pursuing speaking <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/11/public-speaking-tips/#pursuing-speaking\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Finally, this is kind of a tip and general advice. I think it's important to know why you want to pursue speaking. Is it a personal goal to get over a fear of it? Do you want to be able to travel? Do you enjoy educating others? Is it a part of your job? What's your end goal?</p>\n<p>This is going to help you say no to opportunities that may not align with your goals. Speaking can be rewarding, but for some, myself included, it can be incredibly exhausting as well. I no longer enjoy speaking at 6 track conferences &amp; also prioritize events that understand how time-consuming it is to prepare a talk for an event. I used to say yes to every event that came my way, but my mental health is worth more. I also want attendees to get the best version of me when I'm up there.</p>\n<p>I have come a long long way since 2018. <a href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/10-19-2019-first-talk/\">I'm still an introvert</a> but I enjoy speaking and storytelling. I hope some of these tips help you on your public speaking journey.</p>",

You can pay for browser features to be built and for specifications to be written/updated/continued. We'll talk about both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"browser-vendors\">Browser vendors <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/12/how-browser-features-are-built/#browser-vendors\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Browser vendors are the companies that develop, maintain and distribute a web browser. <em>Some</em> browser vendors are also stewards of a whole engine/browser (blink, WebKit and gecko). Google, Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft, Opera, Vivaldi, etc are all browser vendors. Google, Apple and Mozilla are engine stewards.</p>\n<p>There are <em>many</em> teams that make up an entire browser team. A browser is so much more than just the web platform too. There is quite a lot of thought and design that goes into even the smallest user experience updates.</p>\n<p>General consumer facing features, which typically have a UI component, tend to often get prioritized over more &quot;hidden&quot; web platform features for developers. The general consumer base is larger than the developer base. The goal is more market share (more people using your browser) which helps bring money to the browser vendor.</p>\n<p>The web platform team works on browser features and specifications and making sure the implementation matches the spec, so you don't get different behavior in different browsers. But they're also there to enable what we'll refer to as &quot;first party&quot; needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-party-development\">First Party Development <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/12/how-browser-features-are-built/#first-party-development\">#</a></h3>\n<p>First party refers to groups within the same company as the browser vendor. Microsoft Office/Microsoft 365 is an example of a first party within Microsoft with web platform needs. Subsequently, their needs for the web will get prioritized.</p>\n<p>Surface Duo is another example. I spent a lot of time talking about the web platform primitives and design considerations for dual screen devices. Having layout capabilities that adapted to this new form factor was incredibly important so the specification and implementing those features were also prioritized.</p>\n<p>In my experience, first party development is typically prioritized above all else as you're enabling/enhancing another product in the company. Especially if those products are money-makers. These are also broader company strategic initiatives and very visible ways to make impact.</p>\n<p>Come yearly review time, these things matter for compensation and bonuses. It is all deeply intertwined in company politics. These are things that make the company money and make the business case for having a browser. Bill Gates' <a href=\"https://lettersofnote.com/2011/07/22/the-internet-tidal-wave/\"><em>The Internet Tidal Wave</em> memo</a> from 1995 even points out how access to the internet through PCs is vital for the business. Enhancing user experience and moving the web forward will be what wins consumers over.</p>\n<h2 id=\"external-companies-and-third-party-development\">External Companies and Third Party Development <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/12/how-browser-features-are-built/#external-companies-and-third-party-development\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Another scenario is when an external, or third party, company has needs for the web platform. My experience with this while working at a browser vendor company is more limited. Third party can also mean general web developers. It was much harder to get the needs of the general web development community prioritized when first party often takes priority.</p>\n<p>I truthfully can't remember whether it was/is possible for third parties to ask Microsoft to work on enabling certain features. I mean, of course you can ask, but I'm not sure how often an agreement would be made. With a relatively small team working on enabling web platform features, this probably wasn't/isn't a common scenario unless there's some big underlying strategic initiative that would benefit the browser and company. This type of contract could entirely have been outside my sphere of work.</p>\n<p>The trouble with being a third party is that it's not as easy to align priorities or business cases.  In fact, you might even be a competitor.  Regardless, since resources are finite, it's likely that it's difficult to convince vendors to pay attention to your specific needs.  At the end of the day, practically speaking, funding is required to advance features, fix bugs, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consultancies\">Consultancies <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/12/how-browser-features-are-built/#consultancies\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Guess what? Yes! You can hire experts to implement web browser features and/or give you that attention and priority!  Do you need a new feature implemented or spec'd? A consultancy can help. Do you need bugs that are affecting your organization fixed? A consultancy can help.</p>\n<p>If you have a need for a web platform feature, there are consultancies available for hire to help write and edit the specifications, work with standards groups, write web platform tests and get that feature shipped (or ready to be shipped).</p>\n<p>I work for <a href=\"https://igalia.com/\">Igalia</a>, and you can hire us for many things across many technologies and areas including web platform development.</p>\n<p>In fact, we've been pivotal in moving forward a whole lot of things in the Web Platform, including features like CSS Grid, <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/canihas.html\"><code>:has</code></a>, container queries, MathML, classes in JavaScript, scroll snap, <code>list-stlye-type: &lt;string&gt;</code>...the list does go on and on. We work on lots of specifications and implementations for the web platform.</p>\n<p>Instead of waiting or relying on a browser vendor to implement the features you need, which could potentially be years or even possibly never, you can hire experts like Igalia to do this work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-should-i-hire-a-consultancy-to-build-web-platform-features%3F\">Why should I hire a consultancy to build web platform features? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/12/how-browser-features-are-built/#why-should-i-hire-a-consultancy-to-build-web-platform-features%3F\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The most obvious answer is: It works. We've helped a lot of happy customers do amazing things.</p>\n<p>Aside from needing features more quickly, hiring a consultancy like Igalia has advantages. We are experts in these processes and the dynamics of working in standards bodies, and our strength comes from not only our technical expertise, but our ability to navigate between the three main browser vendors with web engines to ensure feature design is agreed upon. This is a lot of work and often times it can be slow because there are only a handful of people at browser vendor companies who are responsible for reviewing patches, proposed features, design documents, etc etc.</p>\n<p>Let's say you are a customer with a web platform need. You most likely have a backlog of work for your engineering team. There could be a few different scenarios that prevent you from internally prioritizing the web platform need: No one on the engineering team has the technical background for the type of work you need done, someone might have the technical background but not enough time to manage the entire process of spec writing, test writing and implementation, or maybe the team just doesn't have the capacity based on broader company priorities and product roadmaps.</p>\n<p>When you hire a consultancy to do this work, then your product engineering team can spend time on the product work and roadmap while we work on the spec, implementation and coordinating among browser vendors. This stuff takes a lot of time, because it's the nature of the work, and it's our area of expertise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"funding-specific-features\">Funding specific features <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/12/how-browser-features-are-built/#funding-specific-features\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There have also been instances where specific features have been funded by the community or donors, primarily driven by a <em>want</em> for better support and not by a business need, even though there most likely are business needs for such feature improvements out there somewhere.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/mathml-core-support/updates/mathml-h1-report-2024\">MathML</a> work Igalia has been doing is an example of that. Igalia also ran <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/index\">an open prioritization</a> experiment where the community collectively selected and funded a feature.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there are really vital features the web needs, but for whatever reason, they're not a priority. With that being said, if anyone's interested in helping to advance and improve SVG, <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/contact/\">drop Igalia an email</a>. We'd love to work on it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\">Closing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/12/how-browser-features-are-built/#closing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I have encountered many people since starting at Igalia earlier this year, who didn't know you could hire someone to build a browser feature, or work on a specification, or fix browser bugs. You can even hire us to work on improving a novel web browser engine (say hello to <a href=\"https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-revival-2023-2024/\">Servo</a>), because you might need a web browser solution that is more lightweight than the major open source options.</p>\n<p>Or maybe you need a browser for your Extended Reality/Virtual Reality device. With 50% of Meta Quest users spending time in the browser, it would be a missed opportunity to not offer the same on your device. This is where we come in with <a href=\"https://wolvic.com/en/\">Wolvic</a>. It's designed with browsing in XR in mind, and you don't have to build a browser from the ground up.</p>\n<p>There are so many benefits to hiring someone to work on The Web in whatever way you may need. It also means the web platform can advance more quickly (in browser timescales anyway) because more people outside of browser vendors are working on things.</p>\n<p>And that's good for the overall health of the web ecosystem.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Thank you to my colleague <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/\">Brian Kardell</a> for reviewing &amp; editing this post, which had been taking up a lot of space in my mind for a long while.</em></p>",

Perhaps it was finally abandoning Twitter, after realizing it's descent into a toxic cesspool was no longer reversible, and finding that when you're not scrolling mindlessly or trying to chase the algorithm you can get a lot done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-one-that-left-an-impact%3A-over-the-edge%3A-death-in-the-grand-canyon\">The One That Left An Impact: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4fwIA7R\"><em>Over the Edge: Death in the Grand Canyon</em></a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-book-roundup/#the-one-that-left-an-impact%3A-over-the-edge%3A-death-in-the-grand-canyon\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After visiting the Grand Canyon in October 2023, I picked up this book in January 2024 while in Arizona preparing to bring my dog to England. A rather morbid topic at face value, analyzing all the ways people have died in the Grand Canyon, whether by accident or hubris or unfortunate mishaps. The historical account of the Canyon paired with all these stories (550 deaths are covered in the book) makes for a rather fascinating read. Having witnessed people make poor decisions along the Canyon's edge while visiting, it's so easy to see why there have been so many deaths. An absolute must read if you've ever been or are planning to visit. It instills some respect for the Canyon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-one-that-i-didn't-expect-to-love%3A-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses\">The One That I Didn't Expect to Love: <a href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-book-roundup/\"><em>A Court of Thorns and Roses</em></a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-book-roundup/#the-one-that-i-didn't-expect-to-love%3A-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After finishing Stormlight Archive's <em>Rhythm of War</em>, I felt a bit lost on what to read next. While I do love epic fantasy, sometime it can get a bit tedious. I had seen <em>A Court of Thorns and Roses</em> pop up occasionally on socials, and a sample had been sitting on my Kindle for sometime. It completely swept me away and I fell head first into the romantasy genre. While ACOTAR is not my favorite of the romantasy I've read, it opened up a whole new world of easy to read fantasy without the overhead of epic fantasy, and sometimes that's just what I need to read.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-one-that-broke-my-heart%3A-pale-rider%3A-the-spanish-flu-of-1918-and-how-it-changed-the-world\">The One That Broke My Heart: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4fF7UZu\"><em>Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World</em></a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-book-roundup/#the-one-that-broke-my-heart%3A-pale-rider%3A-the-spanish-flu-of-1918-and-how-it-changed-the-world\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In 2020 my brother recommended reading this book. I bought it but had put off reading it. It broke my heart because it felt like I was reading about COVID. The exact same things happened with flu deniers, people revolting against mask mandates and ignoring quarantine rules. 102 years between each one and humans responded the same way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-one-that-changed-my-perspective%3A-ranger-confidential%3A-living%2C-working%2C-and-dying-in-the-national-parks\">The One That Changed My Perspective: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4j6aGd6\"><em>Ranger Confidential: Living, Working, And Dying In The National Parks</em></a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-book-roundup/#the-one-that-changed-my-perspective%3A-ranger-confidential%3A-living%2C-working%2C-and-dying-in-the-national-parks\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After reading the Grand Canyon book, I was intrigued by this Ranger's memoir sitting on my parents' coffee table. It was an easy and short read and opened my eyes to incredibly difficult and dangerous situations Park Rangers have to deal with, often because people think the rules don't apply to them. I have a much deeper respect for National Park Rangers after reading this book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-one(s)-that-i-couldn't-put-down%3A-fourth-wing-and-the-songbird-and-the-heart-of-stone-(crowns-of-nyaxia-book-3)\">The One(s) That I Couldn't Put Down: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DHZQdg\"><em>Fourth Wing</em></a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DS4dSR\"><em>The Songbird and the Heart of Stone (Crowns of Nyaxia Book 3</em>)</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-book-roundup/#the-one(s)-that-i-couldn't-put-down%3A-fourth-wing-and-the-songbird-and-the-heart-of-stone-(crowns-of-nyaxia-book-3)\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"fourth-wing\">Fourth Wing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-book-roundup/#fourth-wing\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I loved Fourth Wing but particularly loved the dragons and their personalities. Another romantasy, enemies to lovers trope, and I now understand what a Shadow Daddy is (lol). Someone had told me Fourth Wing is supposed to be 50 Shades with dragons. I've never read 50 Shades of Grey but know of its reputation and generally poor writing. Based on what I know of 50 Shades, I have to say this is (most likely) nothing like it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-songbird-and-the-heart-of-stone\">The Songbird and the Heart of Stone <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-book-roundup/#the-songbird-and-the-heart-of-stone\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I was uncertain I was going to love this book because it follows a secondary character from the first two books in the series.

Re-building confidence. Re-building a place to call home. I was and still am releasing a lot of pain and anxiety around moving to Berlin in 2023 and what followed (the layoffs &amp; office closure). I swung completely the opposite direction in terms of company choice in my career. From Unicorn Startup to a Co-Op Technology Consultancy. Upon self-reflecting, I find something comforting in this environment. We are not necessarily at the whims of investors and need to 10x their investment, however we have to work harder to market ourselves and find customers.</p>\n<p>I enjoy working on the web platform and helping to coordinate projects that  get new features shipped. It feels familiar too because I end up encountering so many people I worked with on Microsoft Edge. I've also been getting to use my design &amp; front-end development knowledge recently and I love that.</p>\n<p>The burns from 2023 are starting to heal but I am left with some lingering scars that are taking longer to fade. I am acutely aware of these things and am able to connect the dots and ponder things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shifting-routine\">Shifting Routine <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-year-in-review/#shifting-routine\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I pretty much said goodbye to Twitter (or X whatever the hell it is now) in the autumn. After a year and a half long harassment campaign on the platform, and then Elon Musk taking over, I just couldn't continue. The content being pushed into my timeline drove me away. I started to engage less and less, and I saw less and less of the people I wanted to see in my timeline. It was bringing me anxiety and my mental health was noticeably worse whenever I'd scroll. I'd find myself scrolling without seeing anything that would actually want me to remain on the site. So I downloaded my data and locked down my account.</p>\n<p>After doing that I relaunched <a href=\"https://designfordevelopersbook.com/\">https://designfordevelopersbook.com</a> with a completely new re-design. Built another site I haven't pushed live yet and read 15 books.</p>\n<p>Huh. Strange how that happened.</p>\n<p>I seem to have broke the spell that hell site had on me. The site that acted as the connection to landing my job at Microsoft is long gone. I felt like I owed it some sort of allegiance because my life would be very different had I not been discovered on that platform.</p>\n<p>My mental health is better for it. It's allowed me time and space to create and work on other things. Even with Bluesky, my time is being spent much more thoughtfully, helping me to carve out time for new routines. I started taking Vogue on morning walks, a shift which has been immense for my mental health during the winter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2025-hopes-%26-dreams\">2025 Hopes &amp; Dreams <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/01/2024-year-in-review/#2025-hopes-%26-dreams\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I haven't drawn up my bingo card yet but the things I'm thinking about this year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring more of the UK</li>\n<li>Get my UK license</li>\n<li>Establish a routine of barre &amp; reformer pilates (in progress!)</li>\n<li>More frequent fancy spa days</li>\n<li>Create a community gathering (details coming soon)</li>\n<li>Sell more <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers?utm_source=stimac&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=book_stimac_design_4_19_22&amp;a_aid=stimac&amp;a_bid=5f6ba095&amp;\">books</a></li>\n<li>Build out <em>Design for Developers</em> <a href=\"https://designfordevelopersbook.com/\">The Expanded Resource</a></li>\n<li>Continue to build out my YouTube (I'd love it if you'd <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@seaotta__\">subscribe</a>)</li>\n<li>Continue to prioritize reading (I'm reading books 7, 8 and 9 already)</li>\n<li>Speak at a few events (<a href=\"mailto:steph.stimac@gmail.com\">get in touch</a>)</li>\n<li>Redesign my personal site (lol) and this blog</li>\n<li>I am overdue for mountain biking</li>\n<li>Travel</li>\n<li>A never ending house project list</li>\n<li>More design projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The start to 2025 has been eventful, and I am trying to not get swept up in a chaotic rush.

    "title": "The hard truth about using AI in coding",
    "partialText": "<p>In a recent experience while building a website, I tried to use ChatGPT to help me out with JavaScript. Something I've never needed to fully learn because my work has always been divided by JavaScript devs and HTML/CSS devs. A long time ago I used to be able to write bits in JQuery but that knowledge is long faded. The point is, I've never had to sit down and learn anything beyond the basics of JavaScript because it wasn't required of me.</p>\n<p>While redesigning and building a website for work, I found I needed a bit of JavaScript to get my mobile menu to open and close and thought, why don't I ask ChatGPT what I need. For all my knowledge, I scanned the 10-15 lines of JavaScript that it output, recognized some bits and dropped it into my file. It worked! And then I padded into Jhey's office to tell him of my success.</p>\n<p>&quot;But is the code correct?&quot; He asked. And this, dear reader, is where the hard truth hit me. Jhey looked at the ChatGPT output. It had gifted me 5 lines of completely unnecessary code, and another bit was &quot;fine&quot; but not the most efficient way to write JavaScript. He made a few edits for me and left me to continue on with my CSS overhaul.</p>\n<p>And here's the hard truth: AI is useful <em>if</em> you already know what you're doing. I've watched Jhey work through mathematical problems to help him with code and the difference is, he knows when the output that AI is giving him doesn't make sense or is wrong. The same goes for one of my friends back in Washington state, who has been using ChatGPT to help him speed up his work. They have the background and the foundation to prevent them from committing AI slop code.</p>\n<p>I fear for the students who are only relying on AI to teach them code and are blindly trusting that ChatGPT or Copilot knows what they're doing without the foundational knowledge, or even a mentor to tell them, &quot;this isn't correct&quot; and &quot;this doesn't make sense.&quot;</p>\n<p>I tried to use AI for some pixel to em calculations and it just couldn't calculate what I needed, I ended up scratchpadding what I needed and adjusting things in the browser DevTools to get what I needed. I have not tried to experiment with AI further as the environmental impact of me just trying to experiment weighs heavy on my mind.</p>\n<p>I feel the need to caution, AI is a tool, one of many, but it should not be the only tool in your arsenal as its reliability is fickle. Find books or media from experts to learn from. If you can afford to take a course, do so. If you're a relatively new dev, aim to stand out by understanding what it is AI outputs and be able to say, that can be improved upon and I understand what it means. I have seen many PRs in open source projects be rejected because the code doesn't make sense and the dev who submitted it can't explain what the code means.</p>\n<p>I implore you, please don't blindly trust AI to write your code, lest we be overrun by AI slop for the sake of saying, &quot;I used AI&quot; to appease the investors.</p>",

    "title": "A Year at Igalia",
    "partialText": "<p>March 11th marked my one year anniversary at Igalia. It simultaneously feels like the blink of an eye and also decade. I suspect that's just the way life goes.</p>\n<p>It has been a busy year of rebuilding my self-confidence in my career. Despite it being 2 years since relocating to Berlin and being laid off, I am still mending the trauma of 2023, and working at Igalia has been instrumental in that. Igalia is proof to me that you can have a fulfilling life both in and outside of work <em>and</em> that your work can support and encourage you having that life outside work. A concept foreign to the American mind. The longer I'm outside America, the more radicalized about work, time off and healthcare access I become, but perhaps that's a different blog post.</p>\n<p>A flat structure, co-op, where everyone has a say and works together in a democratic way seems to give me more of a sense of purpose in my work at this point in my life. You're not lining the pockets of a CEO who is going to make more in his yearly bonus than you will ever see in your bank account in your lifetime.</p>\n<p>I am not left feeling inadequate because I didn't create enough business impact or visibility for the work I'm doing. &quot;You did great, and you're a great worker, but you're not visible enough, so your bonus is going to be a fraction of what it could be.&quot; Yep, that happened to me.</p>\n<p>It is not a competition and there are no political games like in big corporate. There are politics, because everything is political, despite what some would tell you, but I find they are healthy conversations about doing things for the good of the company and the individuals in them.</p>\n<p>I still have moments of imposter syndrome. I am not an engineer, and I will most likely never be an engineer, despite the never-ending nagging voice in my head telling me to take a course for X engineering language. I am a designer, and I am product manager with a continually growing understanding of the web platform. Happily, I have been able to put all of those different skills to use in the last year.</p>\n<p>I firmly believe companies like Igalia are vital to a healthy technological ecosystem that continues to evolve. Especially when it comes to the web platform (but that focus might just be because that's what I have the most experience with). If we relied on browser vendors to be the only ones working on web platform features, I don't believe we would have the number of features we have today. Igalia works on so many things for the web platform (here are some examples from <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/2020-Wrap.html\">2020</a>) and I am proud of the work we do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-questions\">Big questions <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/03/a-year-at-igalia/#big-questions\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I've been introduced to big questions in the last year about technology and funding. I'm still nervous about the web and our reliance on big tech to package their browsers for &quot;free&quot; as our primary way to access the internet.</p>\n<p>I question the way we are shoving AI into every single product possible and not questioning the ethical and environmental concerns. But I also understand why so many individuals are trying to sell their AI products and cash in. The cost of living is rising, while salaries and wages are not.</p>\n<p>These big questions come at a time when I'm having an existential crisis about America and the world and systems we have in place. Everything is interconnected, and I work in tech, so I feel hyperaware in the ways in which everything is connected and the ways in which tech influences our world.</p>\n<p>I'm also in an environment where it feels safe to ask ethical questions. Do I have answers to these things that I'm pondering? No. But I'd like to the leave the world better than I found it, and I feel like I'm in a place to do that and these big questions are a way to start the conversation.</p>",

    "title": "In which I discover my book has been scraped by Meta for its AI",
    "partialText": "<p>My manicurist is showing me the Easter nail art she's been practicing. A cute little bunny stares up at me from her plastic practice nail. She's telling me about another piece of nail art that took her a year to master for Valentine's Day. She's joking about putting the bunny art on her CV.</p>\n<p>&quot;You should be proud of it, people can see what's possible,&quot; I say. In the back of my mind I'm teetering on the edge of another topic related to nail art and decide to follow up with it. &quot;You know what annoys me when I'm searching for nail art inspiration now? All the AI ones.&quot;</p>\n<p>Her eyes light up, and we start talking about it. The weird lack of texture on the fingers. The absolutely over the top nail designs that are not possible for her to recreate. She appreciates that I'm able to discern the difference between AI generated photos and not.</p>\n<p>I have a background in design and I work in tech, so I feel extra exposed to all things AI. I explain how wild I find it that people online, especially Facebook, so easily think an AI generated photo is real.</p>\n<p>&quot;If you just take some extra time to actually look at the image, it doesn't look right.&quot;</p>\n<p>She nods along with me and shares the same sentiment. Surprised that people can't seem to discern something doesn't look right.</p>\n<p>It's kind of like Photoshop with hair color, a decade ago. I'd take a photo into my hair stylist, and she'd point out something about the color being impossible to achieve. I tried to be more discerning of my hair inspiration photos going forward.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Later at dinner, I'm talking with one of my best friends from high school who happens to be in town. Somehow things shift to AI again, and I talk about ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think it's weird people use it like a search engine.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I do that,&quot; she says. &quot;But I use critical thinking skills...it even says on the site, results may not be correct. People don't have critical thinking skills anymore.&quot;</p>\n<p>We discuss the bits we find useful about it, the ultimate lack of critical thinking skills, and my fear of TikTok also being used as a search engine and the way people believe everything on the app is legitimate.</p>\n<p>I think about the frustration I'm experiencing with coding and AI being used in tech. My friend is in the medical field. I'm terrified about students using ChatGPT to learn about medicine. That seems much more harmful long term.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>We say our goodbyes and I head to my train, which is cancelled, figures, and wait 20 minutes for the next one. I'm scrolling Bluesky when I see an author talking about their books being in the LibGen database that Meta used to scrape and train their AI.</p>\n<p>I enter my name into the search field, not <em>actually</em> expecting my name or my book to come up, but my phone connection fails, so I try again, at first thinking my name didn't show up. And then it does. Both an unfinished version of my book and my full book are listed.</p>\n<p>I squeeze my phone in fury and can't help but momentarily be consumed by a fury I have not experienced in a very long time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Mark Zuckerberg's net worth is an estimated $235 <em>billion</em>. This is all I can think about while I ponder the three years it took me to write my book.</p>\n<p>I researched, I wrote it, I even designed the original graphics in the book. Something I would not do again if I had the chance. Writing alone is enough work.</p>\n<p>I did all this after hours, while working full time. I was wrapping up final edits and designs while I was relocating from Seattle to Berlin. I was exhausted.</p>\n<p>No one writes a book for the money. I receive 10% in royalties and I have to hustle if I want my sales to tick up for the month.</p>\n<p>If you split out the two advances I received over 3 years, it was the equivalent of being paid $138 a month for writing.</p>\n<p>I hustle my butt off to post book deals and sales. Not because I don't think my book is worth the full retail price, but I appreciate that not everyone can afford the full retail price. Book sales tick up when there is sale on the publisher's website. So that's when I typically try to post about it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You do not get to be a billionaire by being ethical. Clearly, training your company's AI on pirated books is not ethical in the slightest.</p>\n<p>This isn't the first time large companies have taken from individuals. Large brands have been stealing from artists for years. The most memorable case stuck in my mind is <a href=\"https://www.printmag.com/designer-interviews/modern-dog-copyright-and-the-burden-of-proof/\">Modern Dog Design vs Target and Disney</a>. Target sold illustrations created by Modern Dog and in trying to fight Target, ended up having to close.</p>\n<p>Modern Dog was a Seattle creative studio, and I was just two years into my design career when this was all unfolding. Since then though, there have been countless indie artists art ripped off by large companies.</p>\n<p>Instead of doing the ethical thing and hiring those indie artists, stealing because you know it's too expensive to fight back is disgusting. It's parasitic.</p>\n<p>We live in a society that seems to say that art is indeed valuable, because why else would you be stealing it to sell on your merch? But you don't want to pay for it. It's not valuable enough to pay for.</p>\n<p>Well <em>that</em> can't be true now can it, if you're slapping it on merchandise to sell.</p>\n<p>You would rather crush the artist, whose art you stole, and instead further contribute to an artless world? It doesn't make sense to me.</p>\n<p>Whose art are you going to steal when you've crushed all the artists?</p>\n<p>Artists deserve to be paid, writers deserve to be paid...ART IS ESSENTIAL. Art is vital to making our human existence beautiful and colorful. Whether through words, painting, pottery, video.</p>\n<p>It is essential.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I didn't give Meta permission to train their AI on my book. If they'd like to give me a lump sum to compensate for the use that I didn't authorize, I'd appreciate it. But I won't hold my breath.</p>\n<p>I know this sentiment has been shared before: I don't want AI to replace artists and writers, I want it to do my dishes. I want it to clean my house. I want it to give me time back to do the things that bring joy to my soul.</p>\n<p>You don't want artists to be paid, but you can't train your AI without artists.</p>\n<p>But what else should I expect from a company that could bankrupt an individual trying to fight back.</p>\n<p>What else should I expect from a company that profits from a lack of critical thinking skills.</p>\n<p>No ethical billionaires indeed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you would like to support my work, my publisher is having a sale at the time of writing this piece, and you can purchase <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers?utm_source=stimac&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=book_stimac_design_4_19_22&amp;a_aid=stimac&amp;a_bid=5f6ba095\"><em>Design for Developers</em></a>, which is written to be evergreen for anyone trying to learn the basics of design for the web.</p>",

I started to write a log about what happened in March, the first March that did not drag on this year, at least for me, but now it's May and April was precisely what I was expecting it to be: exhausting. I'm still recovering from our trip to Seattle at the end of April.</p>\n<h2 id=\"manchester-united-(march)\">Manchester United (March) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-april-2025/#manchester-united-(march)\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We took a day trip up to Manchester and went to a FA Cup game against Fulham, and despite Man Utd losing, we had a good time.

We stopped at McDonald's on our walk back to the train station and Jhey asked if I wanted chicken nuggets. I made the facial expression and noise for &quot;ugh no thank you, I'm going to be sick.&quot;</p>\n<p>I packed a bag as we were meant to fly to Dublin the following afternoon for two nights.

The excerpt above is from my draft. It turns out I wasn't recovering from our trip. It turns out, I was pregnant (am pregnant). It has completely sidelined me. I am happy to be pregnant, but it is a struggle. I barely left the house in May, with the first trimester flooring me. Figuratively and literally. I wound up in A&amp;E in June after experiencing some pretty severe pain that didn't subside but didn't really get diagnosed. Baby looked fine so after a stressful few hours they sent me on my way and the pain did subside.</p>\n<h2 id=\"manchester-united-(march)\">Manchester United (March) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-june-2025/#manchester-united-(march)\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We took a day trip up to Manchester and went to a FA Cup game against Fulham, and despite Man Utd losing, we had a good time. We didn't really have time to go into Manchester and just drove back south after. I quite enjoyed hearing the entire stadium break out in &quot;Country Roads, Take Me Home&quot; with locations modified to be Manchester related.</p>\n<h2 id=\"events\">Events <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-june-2025/#events\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I attended State of the Browser, one of my favorite events in the UK, at the end of March and then a few days later left for BlinkOn in California. I was giving a co-keynote and got to talk about the select element. It was a full circle moment being able to say, &quot;We finally have customizable select today!&quot;</p>\n<h2 id=\"seattle-(april)\">Seattle (April) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-june-2025/#seattle-(april)\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Not necessarily a vacation. We headed back to the PNW so that I could try and sort out my storage unit since plans to return to Seattle (and live), for the time being, are not in the immediate future. Though I still dream of having a place in West Seattle, and we haven't ruled it out. It's just not the right time. So I spent 4 days going through boxes and boxes of things, donating nearly half the contents of the unit. I managed to get things down to about 12 totes, a chest full of glassware and collectibles, and a couch I can't seem to let go of.</p>\n<p>There were a few tears and I completely crashed in the evening from emotional and physical exhaustion. I now suspect this is also because I was 3 or 4 weeks pregnant and didn't know so hormones were starting to rise!</p>\n<h3 id=\"birding\">Birding <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-june-2025/#birding\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We usually make time to grab a coffee and go walk Lincoln Park in West Seattle when we visit. Now that I'm full on into birding, it was like discovering an entirely new place. There are so many pretty birds around! We spotted quite a few and our favorites were the black-capped chickadee and the spotted towhee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arsenal-(may)\">Arsenal (May) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-june-2025/#arsenal-(may)\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Jhey got tickets from one of his coworkers at Vercel, and we got to sit pitchside for the game. An absolute treat and I'm an Arteta and Trossard stan, so the ultra HD experience made my day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-brief-recap-of-may-and-june\">A brief recap of May and June <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-june-2025/#a-brief-recap-of-may-and-june\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After the Arsenal match, I found out I was pregnant. I was so bloody exhausted and cancelled a trip to Dublin the day we were supposed to travel, so I suspected something was up. I never cancel travel. I was pretty incapacitated for the whole month of May and knew I would be going to Spain at the start of June for work.</p>\n<p>I managed to survive Igalia Week in Spain and by the end of June, the nausea wasn't too bad. We went to Croatia for a few days for my birthday and that was a nice way to get out of the house. It was a relatively chill trip and was mostly spent relaxing.</p>\n<p>My ability to do anything physical has been incredibly diminished, which has been hard. All the food I want to eat is in America, which has been incredibly annoying living in the UK.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i've-been...\">What I've been... <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-june-2025/#what-i've-been...\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"watching\">Watching <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/05/web-witch-june-2025/#watching\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Jhey hadn't watched <em>The White Lotus</em>, and I never finished season 2. We did a watch of both seasons in preparation for season 3 and despite traveling during the finale, I managed to avoid spoilers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>MobLand</em> - Really good. I wasn't sure after the first two episodes but we were hooked by the end of the series.</li>\n<li><em>Wheel of Time</em> - I haven't finished the season yet, and I spoiled the finale for myself on accident. As a book reader, I had started to enjoy season 3 but knowing what I know has once again left me disppointed with the series. July edit: The series wasn't renewed, and I honestly can't say I'm surprised. They managed to alienate a huge fan base by rewriting key parts of the story and allegedly ignored Brandon Sanderson's feedback. As a huge fan of the books I'm sad we didn't get the TV adapation we wanted.</li>\n<li><em>Real Housewives of Potomac</em> - I'm finally catching up on seasons I haven't watched. My energy levels have been super low, so sometimes I just want that reality TV.</li>\n<li><em>The Valley</em> - More reality TV. I can confidently say I don't want Jax Taylor on my screen. Shame on Bravo. This season is potentially triggering for anyone who has experiened domestic violence.</li>\n<li><em>Grey's Anatomy</em> - I'm not sure what entirely prompted this apart from being pregnant and wanting a show with long seasons.

    "title": "The Death of Curating, the Rise of Curation",
    "partialText": "<p>I've been trying to make an effort to more intentionally pick something to watch when the weekend rolls around. While I've enjoyed the Grey's Anatomy binge I started during this pregnancy, it feels like a work week ritual -- something to put on in the background or pay half attention to. On the weekend, I've had the desire to create a different kind of ritual, one that feels more deliberate.</p>\n<p>After a nice evening out at the pub and a short walk along the river, we headed home and I began the usual pursuit of something to watch. I tried our four different streaming services, growing more and more frustrated. There were no new films we hadn't seen, and while I enjoy, actually prefer if we're being honest, films from the 80s and 90s, the selection on the apps has been the same for ages.</p>\n<p>In that moment of frustration, I felt my heart crack and I nostalgically said I miss being able to go to the movie store and pick out a film.</p>\n<p>The trip to the movie store was a ritual in itself. It was an event. There was a deliberateness in browsing the new release wall and picking up the movie boxes to read the case. Independent films were tucked in between the big blockbusters, but they were available and visible. Next would be the wander between rows of the old movies. A leisurely browse to see if anything else caught your eye from a time long past.</p>\n<p>Finally, the walk to the register, past popcorn and snacks and soda pop. Do you want a bucket of popcorn for your at home movie experience? Mom, can we get a soda? And then you'd go home and watch your movies.</p>\n<p>I worked at two movie stores in college, Hastings and Blockbuster. And there were even rituals I enjoyed as someone wearing the Customer Service Representative badge. (I'm sure I am looking at this time long past through nostalgia colored glasses.)</p>\n<p>I had regulars I would recognize who would come in every week, get their movie, get their popcorn, and we would chat while I rang them up. I still remember a few of them, one of them was Sean Bean's doppelgänger which brought me great joy.</p>\n<p>Scanning the movies that came back in and needed to be returned to the floor presented another opportunity to find a hidden gem, to be intrigued by a title or the cover art.</p>\n<p>You explored, you tried new things, you curated your taste.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-illusion-of-choice\">The Illusion of Choice <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/08/the-loss-of-curating/#the-illusion-of-choice\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There was a time when Netflix was DVD only. I remember re-ordering my queue of movies to be sent to me when I returned whatever I had rented. Slowly over time it shifted to what it is now. All digital, with a loss of access to a wide array of older films, replaced by Netflix's own content.</p>\n<p>Netflix's shift to their own content isn't the problem though (except when they cancel good shows). The problem is the illusion of choice presented and an algorithm that is now guessing what it thinks I might like and showing me that.</p>\n<p>Netflix also has a habit of repackaging the same list of movies just reordered under a different category name, and there is nothing I find more annoying. If there's some data out there about people picking a movie they've already skipped over because it's under a new category title, I would love to see it. But to me, it feels like I am being shown a facade. &quot;Look at all this media we have!&quot; So you scroll and scroll, and then I've seen the same movies listed 3-4 times.</p>\n<p>I am being shown a fraction of the films I know are available. Am I actually browsing? Or am I being profiled and curated to?</p>\n<p>&quot;Here is your selection fo films, here's more of what you like! Surely you just want more that.&quot;</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way we lost the joy of discovery and exploring and instead relinquished our curiosity to let the algorithm take over and passively serve us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"giving-away-the-joy-of-discovery\">Giving Away the Joy of Discovery <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/08/the-loss-of-curating/#giving-away-the-joy-of-discovery\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I have yet to find a streaming service that actually replicates the movie catalogue of a rental store. I don't think it's even possible with licensing. Curating and discovering films has lost its sparkle and its ritual. The digital scroll is much less satisfying.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just in film that we’ve surrendered the experience of uncurated browsing.</p>\n<p>We've lost it on the web. We've surrendered the joy of exploring our spaces and finding like-minded people for social media. The algorithm is constantly feeding us content it thinks we'll like based on what we've engaged with. Instagram's explore page is the worst offender. I rarely see the type of content I want to see and instead am served up content related to reality TV and to clear it out, I need to go on a liking spree to see more of what I want, but it never seems to stick.</p>\n<p>They got rid of recent hashtags so discovering smaller accounts on your own became more difficult. And in turn, creators trying to find their people quickly tried to mold themselves to what the algorithm was showing them, becoming like everyone else.</p>\n<p>We gave up blogs in place of social media and once again let the algorithm curate to us instead of us curating our space. People still cry out for a chronological timeline, they still cry out to be shown the posts of the people they are following, because the tech wants to curate <em>to</em> you. You have little control.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enter-the-ai-agent\">Enter the AI Agent <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/08/the-loss-of-curating/#enter-the-ai-agent\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I see the AI crowd talking about AI agents and Agentic AI. They want it to replace our current systems and experiences. I wouldn't ask an AI agent to book a table for me. I wouldn't ask it to plan and book a trip for me.</p>\n<p>I don't want to give up more of my <em>agency</em>, my ability to curate my life, to a company. I fear that AI in some ways is just a further avenue to relinquish our decision-making skills through an interface with no humanity.</p>\n<p>We are abstracted away from each other to such a degree the rifts have grown wide and deep. The less interaction we have with people from all walks of life, the more isolated we've become. We rely on tech to fill the gaps that genuine interaction once filled, and it continues to further lead us astray.</p>\n<h2 id=\"actively-choosing\">Actively Choosing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/08/the-loss-of-curating/#actively-choosing\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Curation was once something we did for ourselves, a ritual that shaped our taste and gave us joy. I worry that in our rush toward convenience, algorithms, and now AI agents, we’re letting go of that agency piece by piece. Maybe what we need isn’t smarter technology to choose for us, but the space and intention to start curating again — for ourselves, on our own terms.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Note: Aside from movie stores, I have been missing the late 2000s and early 2010s. For me, style and fashion blogs were abundant and individuality shown through. We've lost that to algorithms and social media. I hope one day we can find it again.</em></p>",

    "title": "A Social Media Detox for the Soul",
    "partialText": "<p>Over the last two months I've felt a noticeable decline in my mental health. I attribute this to multiple unrelated things intersecting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since becoming pregnant, I've felt more isolated than ever. The activities that I normally engage in have become a struggle. While I've got more energy now, a day out with a lot of walking takes it out of me.</li>\n<li>My village of people is in Seattle. Even in trying to find community around Bedford, I've struggled. This hit pretty hard when Jhey went away for a business trip.</li>\n<li>When I'm feeling isolated, I reach for social media. Unfortunately, social media platforms seem to have gotten worse. Even Bluesky. The community I once connected with on Twitter is fractured. My feed is an endless onslaught of calls to action but no community building. Platforms have been designed to push rage bait and bad actors post rage bait with glee. I am uninspired. I find myself longing for the web of 5 years ago, and I don't know where my community has gone.</li>\n<li>On the note of Social Media, I manage accounts for a few open source projects at work and I can’t believe how rude and entitled people have become online. It really got me down when I was checking notifications the other day. It’s always someone behind an avatar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These things plus what I’m sure is a flood of hormones has left me feeling rough. In the last two weeks, I seem to have hit a breaking point. I’ve been on my phone bouncing between platforms, scrolling, and could actually feel myself start to mentally degrade while scrolling. Something needed to change, and I felt like the easiest thing for me to tackle right now is the social media bit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"small-changes-for-maximum-impact\">Small changes for maximum impact <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/08/social-media-detox/#small-changes-for-maximum-impact\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The first change I’ve made is leaving my phone upstairs and out of sight after work. This isn’t always possible but leaving it somewhere that is not easily accessible has been a key step in trying to break my digital dependence.</p>\n<p>The worst bit for me is that in the evening when we’re watching TV, I get an urge to reach for my phone and scroll. Like I have trained myself to not focus on what I’m watching.</p>\n<p>The next change I’ve made is trying to be unavailable unless it’s an emergency or time-sensitive. It’s hard sometimes because the family chat seems to start popping off around 7:00 PM my time. But not every text message needs to be responded to right away (unless it’s my husband because he’s usually asking if I want something while he’s out 😊).</p>\n<p>And finally, identifying activities that fill my time and bring me joy instead of scrolling. I like to cook and bake and for some reason this has felt like a more strenuous activity for the last 6-9 months. I felt like I didn’t have time to do it, but I do have time. I’ve started to meal plan again and ordering groceries online has helped. (Tonight I’m making porcini ragu!)</p>\n<p>Despite my struggles with my phone and social media, I’m still reading frequently. My goal for the year was to read 40 books. I just finished book 38. It has been such a joy to prioritize books I enjoy and has really changed how I read and what I try to read.</p>\n<p>I hope to start blogging more and writing about web platform tech again. I’ve been experimenting with SwiftUI and Swift programming and started to build an iOS app. I am time boxing these activities though because the goal is getting away from the screen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finding-community\">Finding community <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/08/social-media-detox/#finding-community\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Jhey and I have some longer-term plans in the works. And I have some ideas and groups in mind I can join after the baby is here.</p>\n<p>But overall, when it comes to my web community, I am grappling with the type of content I see being shared, seeing less authenticity and what generally feels like a fracturing of an already fractured community which can probably be attributed to layoffs and culture shifts within companies.</p>\n<p>When every team must provide business value and contribute to the bottom line, we lose something. There needs to be room for experimentation and failure.<br />\nWhen events shift away from being community-oriented and become product showcases, we become further entrenched into a capitalist marketing machine devoid of authenticity and connection. We’ve lost so many wonderful small events since COVID began, and yet I’ve seen so many companies marketing their own extravagant event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-necessity-of-digital-detox\">The necessity of digital detox <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/08/social-media-detox/#the-necessity-of-digital-detox\">#</a></h2>\n<p>For a long time, I fell into a trap of feeling like I needed to be online all the time. I needed to consume all the bad news to stay informed. This is a trap. We are not meant to consume the amount of content we do. It’s paralyzing.<br />\nThe smallest act of resistance you can do right now is unplug. Do something that fills your cup up. In the end no one’s getting an award for being plugged in 24/7 and destroying their mental health.  Unplug. Find your community offline and stop scrolling.</p>",

I wish I could say I'm shocked, but this is a company led by someone who thinks artists, creators, writers, etc should not be paid for their work.</p>\n<p>These are the words of someone who doesn't understand browser development or the web platform and the years of work it can take to evolve and move web standards forward. Building a browser is about more than just the technology and software design, it's also a community effort. It's about working together across companies to reach a consensus with users and developers in mind. This is the heart of what moves the web platform.</p>\n<p>Innovation in the browser space extends beyond what your typical consumer can see in the UX. Innovation can be quiet and in the details of what we unlock for developers to be able to build with. It's buried in the code that is slowly designed for developers by community input, working groups and invited experts.</p>\n<p>I can't help but feel Sam has a fundamental misunderstanding of what innovation means. This is not the first AI browser, and it certainly won't be the last. AI in the browser is not new, and for many it's been ruining search results and the experience of searching on the web.</p>\n<p>The web platform as a whole needs more sustainable funding. If you want to see more innovation in the browser space, then we need more money for the web platform. Is your company going to pay for browser features to get built? Is it going to get involved in the standards process? Is it going to contribute meaningfully back to the open source ecosystem? Or is it going to continue to take from a digital ecosystem, relying on the hard work and funds of other companies? A particularly egregious route to take when your company is valued at more than $500 billion.</p>\n<p>Without the web platform, you wouldn't have been able to loudly proclaim you have a browser for your AI. But Atlas? This is not what innovation in the browser space looks like.</p>\n<p><strong>Related Reading</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2024/12/how-browser-features-are-built/\">You can pay for that: How web browser features get built</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note: These are my personal thoughts, shared from my own experience in the browser space and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer.</strong></p>",

    "partialText": "<p>Social media feels like it's in the throes of decay. Not just one platform, but multiple platforms. We've lost the social aspect and are only getting the media, and the general vibe I'm getting from people is that they're tired.</p>\n<p>The frustration with Instagram is palpable with folks on Threads. Creators are tired of their content not being shown to their followers and followers are tired of not being able to see content from people that they're actually following. Something happened in the last month and views on Instagram tanked for a good chunk of the user base. It's tanked so badly that people aren't even wanting to post on the platform anymore.</p>\n<p>From a content perspective, it's also become a bit of a nightmare purely because of generative AI. &quot;Is this an AI influencer?&quot; Jhey asked me the other night. It was hard to tell but I was pretty sure it was (the blinking of eyes didn't seem natural), and it was shilling an AI app that's been associated with cheating during interviews. Another account popped up shilling the same app, with a different &quot;woman&quot; this time, and we're pretty confident it's also gen AI. I don't want to look at fake humans and have to question whether the content I'm looking at is generative AI because people are definitely not tagging their posts with an AI label.</p>\n<p>I find myself nostalgic for not only the Instagram of 2014-2018, but the general web of that time. Influencers were kind of a thing, but people still had their blogs as their primary source of content; Instagram was only a supplement to that. So was Twitter.</p>\n<p>And maybe I'm viewing the past through rose tinted glasses, but I felt my interactions on socials were in general...better.</p>\n<p>My tech bubble is on Bluesky which is why I keep returning to scroll. I did delete the app from my phone, and I visit from my browser, but my general opinion as time passes is that Bluesky is problematic in its own ways, especially at the <a href=\"https://plutopsyche.medium.com/blueskys-ceo-meltdown-how-leadership-continues-to-fail-its-most-marginalized-users-8bfa7a8824b4\">C-suite level</a> and with content moderation.</p>\n<p>But outside of those issues, at the content level I feel frustrated. I don't think I felt this way even when I had a larger following on Twitter. The replies to my posts on Bluesky have become increasingly &quot;Well Actually&quot; and &quot;Here's why your opinion is wrong&quot; and quite frankly, it's exhausting.</p>\n<p>I find myself trying to figure out why replies have gotten worse. I'm using Bluesky very much like I used Twitter in the beginning -- like a microblog. I share random bits about tech, about my personal life (which at the moment is very much consumed by pregnancy), and replies from strangers on Bluesky are so much more negative and mansplainy than on Threads.</p>\n<p>I wish I could figure out why. Is it because I'm a woman? Is it because I no longer have &quot;Microsoft&quot; in my bio? Do people really have that hard of time scrolling by if they don't have anything kind to say? I don't know.</p>\n<p>But the people are tired. Tired of posting on platforms that hide their content, tired of features no one asked for and that are being shoved down their throats to maximize ads and specific types of content (e.g. the push for Reels), and people are tired of generative AI.</p>\n<p>The praise for Pinterest was abundant when they rolled out the ability to block AI content in certain categories.</p>\n<p>People are crying out for the social aspect of social media to return. They want to connect with humans, not bots or computers, and I think we're still clinging to social media as a way that facilitated that connection in an era that is seeing a loss of physical third places. We turned to social media at the height of the COVID pandemic but lost so much when we returned to physical spaces. We're clawing for connection while billionaires try to force us into appeasing their algorithms.</p>\n<p>So where do we go from here? Can it ever be the way it was before? Probably not. But we can try and make things better now by trying to find connection through physical means, not just digital. By increasing our empathy. By taking a moment to pause before replying when you're scrolling. By celebrating each other. By complimenting a stranger.</p>\n<p>Maybe once we rebuild our ability to connect in person, we can dismantle the hellscape of an echo chamber social media has become and bring it back around to being just another tool to connect with community, but not the <em>only</em> way.</p>",

    "title": "Going on maternity leave",
    "partialText": "<h2 id=\"tl%3Bdr-summary\">tl;dr summary <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/12/maternity-leave/#tl%3Bdr-summary\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I'm heading out on maternity leave a little earlier than planned. I'm not sure where the last eight and a half months have gone but here we are! It's a very weird feeling to be prepping and handing off projects. All of my co-workers have been so lovely and supportive, and were especially supportive when I said I needed to start my leave earlier. These final weeks have been so emotionally and physically challenging. I'm looking forward to hunkering down and resting and doing whatever final prep I can before our little girl is here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-pregnancy-journey\">My pregnancy journey <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/12/maternity-leave/#my-pregnancy-journey\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Being hyper-independent and being pregnant do not go hand in hand. The last eight and a half months of my life have been emotional, introspective, and physically painful. By medical standards I have had a pretty easy pregnancy, despite the screeching narrative that if you are a woman over 35 and you get pregnant, you are inherently high risk and will have a terrible time and you will have everything that could go wrong with your pregnancy, go wrong.</p>\n<p>I haven't had high blood pressure, no risk for gestational diabetes or anything that would indicate I need to be worried about pre-eclampsia. My placenta was low at the 20 week scan, and they ordered an extra scan at 32 weeks to make sure it had moved. It did. One midwife thought baby was breech but if she was, she righted herself before the 32 week scan and has been in the right place at following midwife appointments.</p>\n<p>Again, a pretty &quot;easy&quot; pregnancy if you ignore all the other normal symptoms.</p>\n<p>From around week 5 or 6 to week 19 and 20, the food aversions and nausea were debilitating. Craving a certain kind of food to taking a bite of it and wanting to throw up is a confusing experience.</p>\n<p>During this same time period, I could not get through a full day of work and had to break my work day up. If my job was not remote, I don't know what I would have done, and I could only think of the soon-to-be mamas who had to go into their place of work for 8 hours dealing with symptoms similar to mine or worse. I read stories of women who had quit their job because the first trimester was so debilitating.</p>\n<p>I was a fairly active person before this, walking into town, taking the dog on multiple walks a week, barre and pilates classes. The fatigue, exhaustion and nausea was too much until around week 22. Then there was a period of about 10 weeks where I was able to return to my barre yoga classes, which slowly morphed into slow yoga classes and then I gave up around 34 weeks. Walks became excruciating, even early on, and I had to hire a dog walker. The routes I take now are barely a half mile, though sometimes I manage just under a mile when Jhey comes along. This reduction in activity has taken such a toll on my mental health that I've tried to find new things to do at home to keep me active. These things have manifested in the form of knitting, baking and cooking.</p>\n<p>Tailbone pain has been a constant battle that has sent me into more than one emotional breakdown because the pain has been so debilitating. Baths and paracetamol have been staples and essential (and frequent). If I do too much around the house, the tailbone pain hits. If I go for too long of a walk, if I stand for too long in the kitchen, it is there and it is excruciating.</p>\n<p>In these final few weeks, I've had constant heartburn, restless legs and shortness of breath. Walking up the stairs leaves me breathless. The restless legs sometimes give me anxiety and are their own special kind of hell.</p>\n<p>I'm exhausted, unable to sit comfortably, brain fog and forgetfulness are at an unprecedented level even by my standards. I don't know whether it's related or not but a crown on a back molar cracked and fell off. No one warns you about the havoc pregnancy can wreck on your teeth.</p>\n<p>At moments I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread. The whole experience has been isolating, especially because I am not close to friends or family (they're all mostly across the pond). Then throw your normal life admin on top of this experience, it's been difficult.</p>\n<p>My dog has a secondary skin infection that's gotten worse over the last few weeks so I'm off to the vet again for the 4th time in 4 months and having to be cautious and mindful about petting her hasn't made anything about these final few weeks of pregnancy better.</p>\n<p>I thought I would be able to work up until the time I had planned but I can't. It felt like admitting defeat when in reality it's just deeply rooted American work <s>values</s> brainwashing. &quot;You should be working when you're sick or ill or physically in pain.&quot;</p>\n<p>This whole experience has made me more staunchly pro-choice. Maternity leave benefits should be increased or made into law (looking at you America), because you cannot expect women to endure pregnancy and postpartum, be back to work 4 weeks later and have a healthy functioning society.</p>\n<p>I have had all the support and flexibility possible to get through these 9 months, and it has still been the most challenging and debilitating experience of my life. What are we doing for the women who don't have that support and flexibility? You can't blame women for not having babies when we live in a society where the cost of living is so astronomically high that both parents need to be working. If you don't offer support or relief or a feasible path forward, you cannot blame women.</p>\n<p>So here I am, approaching my due date. Tired and radicalized. Very over being pregnant but very ready to meet our baby girl.</p>\n<p>Now I get to grapple with the deep feelings of unease that come with prepping for maternity leave, again a byproduct of America's work culture and not the culture of the company I work at. I've been working in design and tech for the last 16 years, so some uncomfortable feelings of stepping away for a few months have bubbled up. I imagine that's probably normal.</p>\n<p>I've spent this week working half days and wrapping up some remaining tasks at work. I wanted to be present for our final company meetings of the year so today I'll attend the second half of those meetings and then log off until May.</p>\n<p>And that's all folks. What a very long year it's been.</p>",

    "title": "2025 Year in Review",
    "partialText": "<p>When I reflect on 2025 it's hard to not focus on one thing: that I was pregnant (and still am as of this moment. Due in 2 weeks.) It is easy to just say that's what the year was full of and that's that. 4 months before I found out I was pregnant, I had written down my 2024 recap and what my hopes and dreams for 2025 were. They were as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring more of the UK</li>\n<li>Get my UK license</li>\n<li>Establish a routine of barre &amp; reformer pilates (in progress!)</li>\n<li>More frequent fancy spa days</li>\n<li>Create a community gathering (details coming soon)</li>\n<li>Sell more <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/design-for-developers?utm_source=stimac&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=book_stimac_design_4_19_22&amp;a_aid=stimac&amp;a_bid=5f6ba095&amp;\">books</a></li>\n<li>Build out <em>Design for Developers</em> <a href=\"https://designfordevelopersbook.com/\">The Expanded Resource</a></li>\n<li>Continue to build out my YouTube (I'd love it if you'd <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@seaotta__\">subscribe</a>)</li>\n<li>Continue to prioritize reading (I'm reading books 7, 8 and 9 already)</li>\n<li>Speak at a few events (<a href=\"mailto:steph.stimac@gmail.com\">get in touch</a>)</li>\n<li>Redesign my personal site (lol) and this blog</li>\n<li>I am overdue for mountain biking</li>\n<li>Travel</li>\n<li>A never ending house project list</li>\n<li>More design projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And upon reflecting, I didn't do so poorly when it came to checking things off the list despite being unable to function for a few months.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring more of the UK (Visited Manchester, Bath and Hunstanton)</li>\n<li>Get my UK license (completed in August)</li>\n<li>Establish a routine of barre &amp; reformer pilates (Until the first trimester wiped me out)</li>\n<li>Prioritize reading (I beat my goal of 40 books and am on track to finish 47)</li>\n<li>Redesigned this blog</li>\n<li>Travel (A trip to San Francisco, two Seattle trips, a trip to Spain and Croatia)</li>\n<li>A never ending house project list (We finally got carpet in and re-did the front of the house)</li>\n<li>More design projects (Designed the Servo and Wolvic websites)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some things fell off the list because they just weren't a priority with my energy levels. We did not travel as much as I would have liked to and that is largely due to pregnancy. I didn't have time to focus on building out my site for <em>Design for Developers</em> and you can forget trying to start a community gathering. I stopped vlogging for a little bit, again due to the pregnancy, and started back up again toward the end of summer.</p>\n<p>I got really into bird watching and would have liked to visit a few specific spots but I became less mobile and less inclined to go for long walks after we did a 3 mile loop in my second trimester and I thought my hips and tailbone were going to crumble.</p>\n<h2 id=\"surrendering-to-physical-change\">Surrendering to physical change <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/12/2025-year-in-review/#surrendering-to-physical-change\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I have not accepted the temporary descent into being less mobile and active well or silently. I am an active person and while it's not the run 5 miles sort of active, I like to be out and about and my inability to walk very far or go out without feeling anxious has been difficult. There have been multiple bouts of tears of frustration and pain. It's only in these last few weeks have I been okay with asking Jhey to bring me something from the other room so I don't have to get up. I'm stubborn and hyper-independent.</p>\n<p>In place of being out and about, I've mostly been reading and learning how to knit. I have a sweater I need to put together, and I am knitting a baby blanket.  I've also fallen back in love with cooking.</p>\n<p>During the height of the pandemic, I leaned into cooking and cocktail making. Then from about late 2022 to this year, I struggled with making time for cooking. I tried meal delivery kits and quickly grew tired of the lack of takeaway options in Bedford. I started meal planning again and ordering groceries online. I find cooking a lovely escape from online and tech, and there is nothing more satisfying than taking a bite out of a flavorful dish you made. It's been nice to reclaim my time in the evening and put it toward cooking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-change-of-life-plans\">A change of life plans <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/12/2025-year-in-review/#a-change-of-life-plans\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Another unexpected turn of events came about after I returned from Seattle in July.  It's no secret I miss Seattle and the Pacific Northwest, but something clicked for Jhey too and we started toying with the idea of moving to the USA and back to Seattle. It is a much longer process to get him to the USA than to get me to the UK but we started the process.</p>\n<p>There will be people who will think we are crazy for deciding to move back but life is too short to be unhappy where you're at. Those people are not Jhey and I. They don't have our dreams and hopes and plans. Our support network is much more vast in the USA. We're excited and that's all that matters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hopes-and-dreams-for-2026\">Hopes and dreams for 2026 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/12/2025-year-in-review/#hopes-and-dreams-for-2026\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I am ending this year in a much softer and quiet place. I'm tired (for obvious reasons). I have a few hopes for 2026 but I am not putting a lot of pressure on myself.</p>\n<p>My main goal: me and baby safely leave the hospital healthy and happy.</p>\n<p>Everything else is secondary.</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to being able to walk more than a half mile without wanting to keel over. I miss taking long walks with my dog. I am antsy to get back to pilates and barre classes. I would like us to be able to travel much later in the year.</p>\n<p>But realistically it's hard to plan anything for next year. I have no idea how I'm going to feel or how I'm going to adjust to our new life. I'm already in taking it day by day mode.</p>\n<p>I think that's all I can do right now and that's okay.</p>",
