    "partialText": "<p>A small collection of useful CSS techniques and a quick reminder that print style sheets are still a thing.</p><div class=\"quote\">\n  <blockquote>another old post (who cares?) that was originally on medium and now is on the author's domain blah blah</blockquote>\n  <p>-Random reply guy on Hacker News</p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson\">Aaron Gustafson</a> recently sent a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/788073583528538112\">tweet</a> to <a href=\"http://indiegogo.com\">Indiegogo</a> in which he pointed out that their order details pages aren’t usable when printed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/aaron_tweet.png\" alt=\"Tweet: &quot;Dear @Indiegogo\n, please take a look at how your Order Details pages print. It really sucks right now.&quot; and a screenshot of a print preview filled with huge icons.\" /></p>\n<p>When I saw this tweet it struck me, because I realized that it has been a long time since I have optimized a page for print or even spared a thought on checking.<br />\nMaybe it’s due to the constant resizing of our browsers and making sure that our sites work perfectly in all shapes and sizes or maybe it’s just because I rarely print web pages myself. Whatever it is, I totally forgot about print style sheets and that’s bad.</p>\n<p>Optimizing web pages for print is important because we want our sites to be as accessible as possible, no matter the medium. We <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/11409\">shouldn’t make assumptions</a> about our users and their behavior. People still print web pages. Just think about articles or blog posts, recipes, contact information, and directions or real estate sites. Someone somewhere will eventually try to print one of the pages you made.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I gave up on home printers a long time ago because they always seemed to break after ten minutes of use. But not everyone is like me,…</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>-Heydon Pickering (Inclusive Design Patterns)</em></p>\n<p>If you see yourself in a similar position as I did, this post will hopefully serve you well as a quick refresher. If you haven’t yet optimized pages for print with CSS, the following tips will get you started.</p>\n<h2>1. Embedding print style sheets</h2>\n<p>The best way to embed print styles is to declare the <code>@media</code> rule in your CSS.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  font-size: 18px;\n}\n\n@media print {\n  /* print styles go here */\n  body {\n    font-size: 28px;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively you can embed your print styles in HTML, but this will give you an extra request.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;link media=\"print\" href=\"print.css\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n<h2>2. Testing</h2>\n<p>You don’t have to print a page every time you make a small change. Depending on your browser you can export the page as a PDF, show a print preview or even debug directly in the browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Update November 6, 2019</strong>: Here’s a detailed post (<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/can-you-view-print-stylesheets-applied-directly-in-the-browser/\">Can you view print stylesheets applied directly in the browser? </a>) on how to emulate print styles in 2019 by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriscoyier\">Chris</a>.</p>\n<p>For debugging print styles in Firefox open the <em>Developer Toolbar</em> (Shift + F2 or Tools &gt; Web Developer &gt; Developer Toolbar) and enter media emulate print in the input field at the bottom of the browser window and press enter. The active tab will act as if the <em>media type</em> was print until you close it or refresh the page. <em>(<strong>Update October 20, 2018</strong>: This doesn’t work anymore in Firefox 63+ since the Developer Toolbar has been removed)</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/ff.png\" alt=\"print style emulation in Firefox\" /></p>\n<p>In Chrome open DevTools (CMD + Opt + I (macOS) or Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows) or View &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools) and show the console drawer (Esc), open the rendering pane, check <em>Emulate CSS Media</em> and select <em>Print</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/chrome.png\" alt=\"print style emulation in Chrome\" /><em>print style emulation in Chrome</em></p>\n<h2>3. Absolute units</h2>\n<p>Absolute units are bad for screens but great for print. In print style sheets it’s completely safe and recommended to use absolute <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/length\">units</a> like cm, mm, in, pt or pc.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">section {\n  margin-bottom: 2cm;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>4. Page specific rules</h2>\n<p>It’s possible to define properties specific to the page like dimensions, orientation, and margins with the <code>@page</code> rule. This comes in very handy if you want all pages to have a certain margin.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@media print {\n  @page {\n    margin: 1cm;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>@page</code> rule is part of the <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-page-3/\">Paged Media Module</a>, which offers all kinds of awesome stuff, e.g. selecting the first printed page or blank pages, positioning elements in the corners of a page and <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/01/designing-for-print-with-css/\">more</a>. You can even use it to <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/building-books-with-css3\">make books</a>.</p>\n<h2>5. Controlling page breaks</h2>\n<p>Since printed pages aren’t endless like web pages, content will eventually break on one page and continue on the next page. We have 5 properties to control what happens in that case.</p>\n<h3>Page breaks before an element</h3>\n<p>If we want an element to always be at the beginning of a page, we can force a page break with page-break-before.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">section {\n  page-break-before: always;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-before\">page-break-before on MDN</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Page breaks after an element</strong></h3>\n<p>page-break-after lets us force or avoid page breaks after an element.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">h2 {\n  page-break-after: always;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-after\">page-break-after on MDN</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Page breaks inside an element</strong></h3>\n<p>This property is great if you want to avoid an element to get split between two pages</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  page-break-inside: avoid;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-inside\">page-break-inside on MDN</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Widows and Orphans</strong></h3>\n<p>Sometimes you may not want to force a page break, but at least control how many lines are displayed on the current or the next page.<br />\nFor example, if the last line of a paragraph doesn’t fit on the current page, the last two lines of that paragraph will be printed on the next page, even though just the last one didn’t fit. That’s because the property that controls this – widows – is set to 2 by default. We can change that.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">p {\n  widows: 4;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>If it’s the other way around and only one line fits on the current page, the whole paragraph will be printed on the next page. The property responsible for this behavior is orphans and its default value is 2 as well.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">p {\n  orphans: 3;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The code above means that at least 3 lines have to fit on the current page for the paragraph not to move to the next page as a whole.</p>\n<p>There’s a <a href=\"http://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/oYvBjN\">CodePen</a> ready with some examples. (<a href=\"http://s.codepen.io/matuzo/debug/oYvBjN\">Debug version</a> for easier testing)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-page-break\">Not all properties and values work in every browser</a>, you should check your print styles in different browsers.</p>\n<h2>6. Resetting styles</h2>\n<p>It makes sense to reset some styles like background-color, box-shadow or color for print.</p>\n<p>Here’s an excerpt from the <a href=\"https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/css/main.css\">HTML5 Boilerplate print style sheet</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">*,\n*:before,\n*:after,\n*:first-letter,\np:first-line,\ndiv:first-line,\nblockquote:first-line,\nli:first-line {\n  background: transparent !important;\n  color: #000 !important;\n  box-shadow: none !important;\n  text-shadow: none !important;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Print style sheets are one of the few exceptions where it’s OK to use !important ;).</p>\n<h2>7. Removing unnecessary content</h2>\n<p>To avoid unnecessary waste of ink you should remove irrelevant stuff like presentational content, ads, navigation, etc. with display: none.</p>\n<p>You may even want to just show the main content and hide everything else.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body &gt; *:not(main) {\n  display: none;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>8. Revealing URLs in links</h2>\n<p>Printed Links are completely useless if you don’t know where there are leading.</p>\n<p>It’s pretty easy to display a links target next to its text.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">a[href]:after {\n  content: ' (' attr(href) ')';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, this will display relative links, absolute links to your site, anchors, etc. as well. Something like this might serve better:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">a[href^='http']:not([href*='mywebsite.com']):after {\n  content: ' (' attr(href) ')';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Looks <em>interesting</em>, I know. These lines mean: Display the value of the <code>href</code> attribute next to every link that has a <code>href</code> attribute, which starts with <em>http</em>, but doesn't have <em>mywebsite.com</em> in its value.</p>\n<h2>9. Revealing expansions in abbreviations</h2>\n<p>Abbreviations should be wrapped in <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> elements and their expansions included in the title attribute. It makes sense to display those on printed pages.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">abbr[title]:after {\n  content: ' (' attr(title) ')';\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>10. Forcing background printing</h2>\n<p>Usually, browsers won’t print background colors and background images if you don’t tell them to, but sometimes you may want to force printing them. The not standardized <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-print-color-adjust\">property</a> print-color-adjust lets you overwrite the default settings for some browsers.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">header {\n  -webkit-print-color-adjust: exact;\n  print-color-adjust: exact;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>11. Media Queries</h2>\n<p>If you write your media queries like in the following example be aware that the CSS rules in this media query won’t apply to the print style sheet.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@media screen and (min-width: 48em) {\n  /* screen only */\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Why you ask? Because the CSS rules only apply if the <code>min-width</code> is <code>48em</code> and the media-type <code>screen</code>. By getting rid of the screen keyword the media query is only limited by the <code>min-width</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@media (min-width: 48em) {\n  /* all media types */\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>12. Printing Maps</h2>\n<p>Current versions of Firefox and Chrome are able to print maps, but Safari for example, isn’t. Some services provide <a href=\"http://staticmapmaker.com/\">static maps</a> which you could use instead.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.map {\n  width: 400px;\n  height: 300px;\n  background-image: url('http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=Wien+Floridsdorf&amp;zoom=13&amp;scale=false&amp;size=400x300&amp;maptype=roadmap&amp;format=png&amp;visual_refresh=true');\n  -webkit-print-color-adjust: exact;\n  print-color-adjust: exact;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>13. QR codes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/tips-and-tricks-for-print-style-sheets/#print-qr-codes-for-easy-url-references\">This Smashing Magazine article</a> has some nice tips. One of them is to provide a QR Code for printed pages so that users don’t have to type the whole URL to get to the live version.</p>\n<h2>Bonus: Printing non-optimized pages</h2>\n<p>During my research, I found a great tool which helps you print non-optimized pages. With the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.github.io/The-Printliminator/\">Printliminator</a> you can remove elements simply by clicking on them.</p>\n<p>There’s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt8hpqEIL1c\">Demo on YouTube</a> and the project on <a href=\"https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/The-Printliminator\">Github</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bonus II: Gutenberg</h2>\n<p>If you are into frameworks, you may like <a href=\"https://github.com/BafS/Gutenberg\">Gutenberg</a> which makes optimizing for print a little easier.</p>\n<h2>Bonus III: Hartija</h2>\n<p>There’s another framework for print style sheets by <a href=\"undefined\">Vladimir Carrer</a> called <a href=\"https://github.com/vladocar/Hartija---CSS-Print-Framework\">Hartija</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s it! Here’s the link to the <a href=\"http://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/oYvBjN?editors=1100\">CodePen</a> I made (<a href=\"http://s.codepen.io/matuzo/debug/oYvBjN\">Debug version</a>) if you want to see some of this stuff in action.

    "title": "I Threw Away my Mouse",
    "partialText": "<p>Last year I attended JS Conf Budapest and I watched many great talks but “YES! Your site can (and should) be accessible” by Laura Carvajal was the most thought-provoking talk for me. Laura explained how the Financial Times made accessibility a core part of their development process and she shared several lessons she and her team had learned. In her third lesson Throw away your mouse, Laura mentioned that just testing with the keyboard wasn’t enough and that only going keyboard-only all the time made a difference.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CI+Threw+Away+my+Mouse%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Hello World!",
    "partialText": "<p>It happened. I finally have a website.</p>\n<p>Of course, it's not my first website but the first one in a long time. My very first personal site went online about 17 years ago. It was a table-based layout with no CSS at all. All styling happened by adding HTML attributes.</p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;font face=\"arial\" size=\"4\"&gt;\n  &lt;table\n    border=\"2\"\n    cellspacing=\"2\"\n    cellpadding=\"0\"\n    width=\"550\"\n    bordercolor=\"#000000\"\n    bgcolor=\"#004600\"\n  &gt;\n    ...\n  &lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>It was online for about 2 years. After that, the only thing I did was to change the under construction graphic periodically. As it turns out, I'm really bad at getting things done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/w_700/articles/matuzoat2022.png\" alt=\"My first personal website. A all-green table-based layout.\" /></p>\n<p>Fast forward 10 years, I was at my second conference ever, at Smashing Conf Freiburg 2014. I was so inspired by the great talks I had seen, that I decided to set up a WordPress-based blog in one of the breaks to share my notes. The theme was slow and the design was boring but I had a website, which was great because I had the chance to share my knowledge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/w_700/articles/matuzoat2014.png\" alt=\"My second personal site. A web development blog in German.\" /></p>\n<p>Again, I lost interest after 2 years because I didn’t like the design, the site was slow and there where cooler platforms to publish your articles at. I moved to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@matuzo/\">Medium</a>.</p>\n<p>Medium is great for reach but its accessibility isn’t great and there’s an important thing missing: personality. Medium is just content. Besides writing, you can’t express yourself and show your style and your skills. You can’t experiment, you can’t try out new things, optimize performance, accessibility and user experience.</p>\n<p>As already mentioned, I'm bad at getting things done. I always wanted to have a nice looking, fast, and all in all cool website but it just didn’t happen. Not until now! In 2019 I finally launched my new blog. It's by far not done but it's live and will <a href=\"https://github.com/matuzo/matuzoat\">work on it regularly</a> and post articles.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CHello+World%21%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "The Dark Side of the Grid (Part 1)",
    "partialText": "<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/\">CSS Grid Layout</a> is one of the most exciting recent CSS specifications because of its flexibility, extent, and power. It makes our lives so much easier but it also creates new dangers regarding user experience and accessibility.</p><div class=\"post\" data-theme=\"dark-side-of-the-grid\">\n<h2>Preface</h2>\n<p>It has already been two years since the first browsers, Chromium 57 and Firefox 52, shipped CSS Grid Layout un-prefixed. Many developers have experimented with it or are using it in production already. More will come as soon as support for Internet Explorer 10 and 11 becomes less important.\\<br />\nGrid offers many ways of building layouts and it challenges us to rethink the way we approach them. This flexibility is great for our development experience, but it may come at the cost of user experience and accessibility if we don’t use it responsibly.</p>\n<p>This series of articles will give you an overview of potential implementation pitfalls, or in other words, the dark side of the grid.</p>\n<div class=\"demo u-full-width js-demo\"> \n  <div class=\"a-title\">\n    <div

It’s the first true layout method in CSS. Properties like <code>float</code>, <code>display: inline-block</code>, <code>position</code>, and <code>display: table</code> were not originally intended for building layouts.\\<br />\nGrid is a great choice if you're not working on just one axis but one two axes.</p>\n<div class=\"demo u-full-width js-demo\"> \n<ul class=\"a-layout\">\n  <li class=\"a-layout__item\"></li>\n  <li class=\"a-layout__item\"></li>\n  <li class=\"a-layout__item\"></li>\n  <li class=\"a-layout__item\"></li>\n  <li class=\"a-layout__item\"></li>\n  <li class=\"a-layout__item\"></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Of course, there’s Flexbox, but its strength lies in distributing available space and placing items <em>either</em> vertically or horizontally. Flexbox loses a lot of its flexibility as soon as you’re applying <code>flex-wrap</code> and add widths to your flex items.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n<blockquote>If you are adding widths to all your flex items, you probably need grid.\n</blockquote>\n<footer>\n<cite>\nRachel Andrew | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjHOLtouElA\" rel=\"noopener\">Render 2017</a>\n</cite>\n</footer>\n</figure>\n<p>This article assumes that you have at least a basic knowledge of CSS Grid Layout. If you're new to the topic, I suggest you check out <a href=\"https://gridbyexample.com/\">gridbyexample</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelandrew\">Rachel Andrew</a> or <a href=\"http://cssgridgarden.com\">Grid Garden</a> before you continue reading.</p>\n<h2>Name and theme of this article</h2>\n<p>Before we dive into the dark side of the grid, I wanted to quickly address the name and theme of this article.

In our example, those are the <code>h2</code> and the <code>ul</code> – but we want all the <code>li</code> elements to fill cells in the grid.</p>\n<p>Okay, let’s try to fix that.</p>\n<p>PS: I'm well aware that I could apply <code>display: grid</code> to the <code>ul</code> directly but this is just a simplified example. There are other (more complicated) use cases where you can’t do that easily.</p>\n<h3>Solution #1: Flattening the document structure.</h3>\n<p>If the placement algorithm only affects direct child elements, we’ll just make our <code>li</code> direct children by removing the <code>ul</code> and swapping the <code>li</code>s for <code>div</code>s to avoid invalid HTML. This is a solution, but it’s a bad solution because we’re compromising on semantics for design reasons.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Pink Floyd discography&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n  &lt;div&gt;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;A Saucerful of Secrets&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;More&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;Ummagumma&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;Atom Heart Mother&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;Meddle&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;Obscured by Clouds&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;The Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Flattening the document structure may have bad effects on the semantics of your document, which is especially bad for screen reader users. For example, when you’re using a list, <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html\">screen readers usually announce the number of list items</a> which helps with navigation and overview.\\<br />\nAlso, a flat document might be harder to read when displayed without CSS.</p>\n<div class=\"info\">\n<h4><span class=\"info__label\">Wait! What?</span>\n<span class=\"info__heading\">Why would someone disable CSS?</span></h4>\n<p>It’s unlikely that users disable CSS on purpose but sometimes an error occurs or the connection is just so slow that only the HTML displays successfully. If you’ve ever been on vacation in Italy and had to use public WIFI, you know what I’m talking about.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Please don’t flatten document structures.</p>\n<h3>Solution #2: Creating a subgrid</h3>\n<p>The arguably best solution would be to use <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrids\">subgrids</a>. A grid item can itself be a grid container with its own column and row definitions. It can also be a grid container but defer the definitions of rows and columns to its parent grid container.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: subgrid;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>By setting the value of <code>grid-template-columns</code> to <code>subgrid</code> on the unordered list, the list items now align with the parent grid. This is super cool!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, support for subgrid is so bad, it doesn’t even have a <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#search=subgrid\">caniuse page</a>. Subgrids are part of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrids\">level 2 of the CSS Grid Layout specification</a> which is still a working draft.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure figure--full\">\n<a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/s_B782E7B1F35388692E5B4FD985531DE5ABBF6EAD14964927E69E4CE6006AEDE1_1547011977841_Screen_Shot_2019-01-09_at_06.32.36.png\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/s_B782E7B1F35388692E5B4FD985531DE5ABBF6EAD14964927E69E4CE6006AEDE1_1547011977841_Screen_Shot_2019-01-09_at_06.32.36.png\" alt=\"Browsersupport table on caniuse.com for subgrids.\"></a>\n<figcaption>\nAt the moment, subgrids aren’t a standard yet and not supported in any browser.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Use subgrids as soon as they’re available.</p>\n<h3>Solution #3: Using display: contents</h3>\n<p>An alternative to using subgrids is a different property that has a similar effect. If you set the <code>display</code> value of an element to <code>contents</code>, it will act as if it got replaced by its child items.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  display: contents;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>In our example, this causes the list items to take part in the alignment of the sections grid because for them the parent <code>ul</code> doesn’t exist anymore. This is exactly what we want, and it works perfectly fine but, (yeah I’m sorry, there’s a <em>but</em>) Edge doesn’t support it.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure figure--full\">\n<a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549211279/articles/Screen_Shot_2019-02-03_at_17.26.50.png\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549211279/articles/Screen_Shot_2019-02-03_at_17.26.50.png\" alt=\"Browsersupport table on caniuse.com for display: contents; Supported by alt major desktop browsers but only in Firefox without bugs.\"></a>\n<figcaption>\nEdge doesn’t support <code>display: contents</code> due to an accessibility bug in Chrome, Safari and Opera.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The lack of support per se isn’t the issue but rather why it’s not supported. There’s a bug in Chrome, Opera, and Safari that removes an element with a <code>display</code> value of <code>contents</code> from the accessibility tree, <a href=\"http://adrianroselli.com/2018/05/display-contents-is-not-a-css-reset.html\">making it inaccessible to screen reader users</a>. It’s like applying <code>display: none</code> – the element just doesn’t exist anymore for assistive technology.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure figure--full\">\n<a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549454338/articles/contents_devtools.jpg\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549454338/articles/contents_devtools.jpg\" alt=\"The accessibility panel in Chrome DevTools.\"></a>\n<figcaption>\nThe <code>ul</code> should have a <code>role</code> of <code>list</code> but inspecting the element shows that it's not exposed to the accessibility tree at all.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/Status/issues/608#issuecomment-394521198\">Microsoft Edge will consider adding the feature</a> as soon as blink and webkit-based browsers fix the bug. Consider not using <code>contents</code> until then.</p>\n<h3>Solution #4: Nesting grids</h3>\n<p>As already mentioned, a grid item can also be a grid container. We can select the unordered list, make it span the whole width, and inherit values from the parent grid.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  grid-column: 1 / -1;\n  display: inherit;\n  grid-template-columns: inherit;\n  grid-gap: inherit;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Nesting grids isn’t a perfect solution and sometimes it might not work, but in this simple example it’s good enough.</p>\n<div class=\"skip-link-container\">\n<a href=\"#recap\" class=\"skip-link skip-link--inline\">Skip CodePen</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"400\" data-theme-id=\"6054\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-preview=\"true\" data-user=\"matuzo\" data-slug-hash=\"VgMdGO\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"Grid nesting issue solution\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/VgMdGO/\">\n  Grid nesting issue solution</a> by Manuel Matuzovic (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo\">@matuzo</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<h2>Recap</h2>\n<p>The situation regarding subgrids is anything but perfect. The <code>subgrid</code> value isn’t a standard yet, <code>display: contents</code> is buggy, and nesting grids will only work in specific use cases. If you see yourself compromising on semantics just to use CSS Grid Layout, don’t use it or try to workaround the problem until browsers fix the <code>display: contents</code> bug or ship subgrids.</p>\n<p>This was part 1 of the dark side of the grid.

To make sure that focusable elements are sufficiently highlighted all the time, I added these lines to my custom CSS file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">button:focus,\na:focus {\n  /* Highlighting on focus */\n  outline: 5px solid #f23c50;\n  outline-offset: 2px;\n  /* Prevent items from overlapping the outline */\n  transform: rotate(0);\n}</code></pre>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n  <span class=\"content__image-wrapper\">\n     <img class=\"content__image\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1551942659/articles/Screen_Shot_2019-02-22_at_07.09.44.png\" alt=\"Embedded Pen with HTML on the left side and a preview on the right side.

As a mouse user, you just keep scrolling. As a keyboard user, you have to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> at least 9 times until you get to the next focusable element. Or worse, you get trapped in the Pen. This happens if the Pen is editable. You can pass the buttons in the top bar but the journey ends as soon as you get to the <code>pre</code> element where the code is displayed. Once you're in there, there’s no way of getting out.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n  <div class=\"content__video-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UK70AcUb84?rel=0\" title=\"Trapped in an embedded iframe\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n<figcaption>There’s no way of escaping the code area in an editable Pen.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We can’t fix that issue but we can give users more options.

They're often the very first item in a page.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure  figure--full\">\n  <span class=\"content__image-wrapper\">\n     <img class=\"content__image\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1551942659/articles/Screen_Shot_2019-02-22_at_07.51.17.png\" alt=\"A skip link at the top center of the page that says 'skip to main content'\">\n  </span>\n<figcaption>Skip link on Max Böcks website.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Sometimes it also makes sense to add in-page skip links. For example when you want to give users the ability to skip components or widgets in your page with a lot of links, like social media embeds, videos, or CodePens. That’s exactly what I did in my blog post.</p>\n<h4>In-page skip links</h4>\n<p>Directly before the embed code for the Pen, I added a <code>div</code> with an anchor link to an element that comes after the Pen in the DOM. By clicking this link, users can skip everything between the link and the target.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"skip-link-container\"&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"#codepen1-skip\" class=\"skip-link\"&gt; Skip CodePen &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- CODEPEN EMBED CODE --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- The target: --&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=\"codepen1-skip\"&gt;Subsequent element&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>By default, this link should be visually hidden and only visible on focus. It’s not enough to just apply <code>display: none</code> and remove it on focus. To ensure that the link is still accessible to screen reader users, it's necessary to get more creative.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.skip-link-container {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\n/* All the properties in this declaration block only apply if the link isn’t focused. */\n.skip-link:not(:focus) {\n  border: 0;\n  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);\n  clip-path: inset(50%);\n  height: 1px;\n  left: 0;\n  margin: -1px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  padding: 0;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  width: 1px;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>This is a great improvement because we’ve reduced the number of key presses needed to skip the Pen from 9 to 1. There’s just one more thing I want to add. Since the page <em>jumps</em> from the anchor link to the target and the skipped area might not be in the viewport anymore, users might become lost. To help with that, we can give them a visual feedback after the jump has happened.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* “The :target CSS pseudo-class represents a unique element (the target element) with an id matching the URL's fragment.”\n  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target */\n\n*:target {\n  transition: background 0.2s;\n  animation: target-highlight 1.2s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n@keyframes target-highlight {\n  50% {\n    background: #f23c50;\n  }\n  100% {\n    background: none;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>And this is how the final result looks like.

I haven't tested how accessible embedded CodePens are for screen reader users but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottohara\">Scott O'Hara</a>, who reviewed this article, told me that he had difficulties using Pens with VoiceOver in the past. So, the next thing I (or you? 🙂) could do is to test CodePens with several screen readers and share the results.</p>\n<p>Until then, keep on making awesome websites for everyone.

Today I'm here to give you tips that will help you create better apps and reach more people.</p>\n<h3>About this talk</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.004.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>This talk is called <cite>12 Tips For More Accessible React Apps</cite>. At the time when I picked the title I didn’t know how much time I will have so I just picked an arbitrary number and I thought that 12 will be fine.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, I only have 20 minutes so let’s get started with my 8 tips for more accessible react apps. 😄</p>\n<h3><abbr title=\"acessibility\">a11y</abbr> tip #1: Create a sound document outline</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.005.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>My first tip is: Create a sound document outline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.006.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;h1&gt;Yo! I&#039;m the title of your page.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I&#039;m very important.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My parent is very important.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My parent is very important.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;I exist.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I&#039;m very important.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My parent is very important.&lt;/h3&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>What I mean by that is that you should start your document with an <code>h1</code> and the title of your page.</p>\n<p>Large sections, thematic groupings of content, in your page start with an <code>h2</code>. If there are subsections use <code>h3</code>, <code>h4</code>, etc. If there’s another large thematic section you go back to the <code>h2</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbHCgiktPNc\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"React demo: VoiceOver navigation by headings\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>This is important because screen reader users don't just use the software by reading the contents on a page from top to bottom. There are additional ways of navigation, for example by listing all headings and jumping directly to a specific heading.</p>\n<p>In VoiceOver you get a list of all headings. The level is announced with the text of the heading to give users context and understand the page hierarchy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.007.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;Heading.H&gt;I will be an h1&lt;/Heading.H&gt;&lt;Heading.LevelBoundary&gt;&lt;Heading.H&gt;I will be an h2&lt;/Heading.H&gt;&lt;Heading.LevelBoundary&gt;&lt;Heading.H&gt;I will be an h3&lt;/Heading.H&gt;&lt;/Heading.LevelBoundary&gt;&lt;Heading.H&gt;I will be an h2&lt;/Heading.H&gt;&lt;/Heading.LevelBoundary&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>Sometimes that's hard to get right, especially when you're working with nested components. An <code>h2</code> in a component is correct in one place but might be wrong when it's nested in another.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tenon-ui.info/\">Tenon UI</a>, an accessible React components library, has a component that takes care of that. You start with a <code>Heading.H</code> component which will automatically become an <code>h1</code> and then you use the <code>Heading.LevelBoundary</code> component to create a new section and allow automatic level calculation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.008.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;h1&gt;I will be an h1&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I will be an h2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;I will be an h3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I will be an h2&lt;/h2&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>The result is an automatically calculated correct document outline.</p>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLSEWdpmYrc?rel=0\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"React demo: Testing the document outline with tota11y\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>There are many ways of testing the document outline. A quick and easy way is a browser extension called <a href=\"https://khan.github.io/tota11y/\">tota11y</a>.<br />\ntota11y annotates headings and shows the document outline. It displays errors if the outline is not correct.</p>\n<h4>Summary of the first tip</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.009.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Create a sound document outline because it gives your document structure, helps screen reader users with navigation, and it's important for SEO.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.tenon-ui.info/headings\">Tenon UI's headings component</a>. Test your document outline with <a href=\"https://khan.github.io/tota11y/\">tota11y</a> or <a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/\">wave</a>.</p>\n<h3><abbr title=\"acessibility\">a11y</abbr> tip #2: Hide content correctly</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.010.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>My second tip is: Hide content correctly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.011.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The React Finland website starts with an <code>h1</code> and has a well structured document outline. It's almost perfect, there’s just one thing I'd want to improve. There should be a \"Sponsors\" <code>h2</code> that groups the different types of sponsorships.</p>\n<p>I guess it's missing because it hasn't been considered in the design either. There might be a reason to leave it away in the design but it should be in the document. The design shouldn't dictate the outline but the content should. What we need here is a heading that's hidden from sighted users but accessible to screen reader users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.012.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><code>display: none;</code>, <code>visibility: hidden</code>; and the <code>hidden</code> attribute are not suitable for hiding content visually because they remove content from the accessibility tree making it inaccessible to screen reader users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.013.jpeg\" alt=\".u-vh { border: 0; clip: rect(0 0 0 0); height: 1px; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; position: absolute; width: 1px; white-space: nowrap;}\" /></p>\n<p>We need a little bit more than that. A <a href=\"https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-css-with-accessibility-in-mind-8514a0007939#81ec\">combination of properties</a> that makes sure that content is still accessible to screen readers but not visible or focusable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.014.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;h2 className=&quot;u-vh&quot;&gt;Sponsors&lt;/h2&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>To improve the React Finland website we add a visually hidden <code>h2</code> and transform the existing <code>h2</code>s to <code>h3</code>s.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.015.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;button&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;u-vh&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;path …&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>You can use this technique as well when you have an icon button without text. You just put the text in a u-vh <code>span</code> inside the <code>button</code> and you've got yourself an accessible button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.016.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;button&gt;&lt;VisuallyHidden&gt;Save&lt;/VisuallyHidden&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;path …&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>You could write a component for that or use the existing <a href=\"https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/tree/master/packages/u-vh\">VisuallyHidden component</a> from the <a href=\"https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/\">Reach UI React library</a>.</p>\n<h4>Summary of the second tip</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.017.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><code>display: none;</code>, <code>visibility: hidden;</code> and the <code>hidden</code> attribute remove content from the accessibility tree.<br />\nEvery item needs a textual representation, even if it isn’t visible. Check out Reach UI's VisuallyHidden component.</p>\n<h3><abbr title=\"acessibility\">a11y</abbr> tip #3: Use <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> if you need a button.</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.018.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Tip number 3: Use <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> if you need a button.</p>\n<p>It's tempting to use <code>div</code>s as buttons because they come with less default styling than HTML <code>button</code>s but there’s a huge difference when it comes to user experience.</p>\n<p>I'll show you the difference in the following demo.</p>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1sdW9GNSwE?rel=0\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"React demo: Using a HTML button as button\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>In this example I put a click event on a HTML <code>button</code>. You can see that I can click it with a mouse and focus it using the keyboard. I can trigger the event using the mouse or by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key.</p>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mbGqcHdCIRA?rel=0\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"React demo: Using a div as button\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This button looks the same but this time I'm using a <code>div</code> instead of a <code>button</code>. I can click the button but I can’t focus it, because divs aren't focusable by default. Even if I could focus it, I wouldn't get the key events I get with the HTML <code>button</code> element.</p>\n<p>A fake button is inaccessible to keyboard and screen reader users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.019.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\nSummary of the third tip: <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s are focusable by default, they come with keyevents for free and they're semantic. A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is just generic text.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZGqnp06DnI\">Just use button</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rob_dodson\">Rob Dodson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XjwDq9zG4I&amp;t=1son\">The Links vs. Buttons Showdown</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a> on YouTube.</p>\n<h3><abbr title=\"acessibility\">a11y</abbr> tip #4: Use fragments to avoid invalid HTML.</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.020.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If a component returns multiple elements, they must be wrapped in a wrapper element, for example a <code>div</code>. This might cause invalid HTML or break your layouts.</p>\n<p>React 16.2 introduced a nice little feature called <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html\">Fragments</a>. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.021.jpeg\" alt=\"const Table = props =&gt; { return ( &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;Columns /&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; ); }\" /></p>\n<p>Let’s say we have table component and in each table row there’s a column component.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.022.jpeg\" alt=\"const Columns = props =&gt; { return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); }\" /></p>\n<p>This is how the <code>Columns</code> component looks like. All cells are wrapped in a <code>div</code> because we need a wrapper element.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.023.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>The result is invalid markup because a <code>div</code> is not a valid descendent of <code>tr</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.024.jpeg\" alt=\"const Columns = props =&gt; { return ( &lt;React.Fragment&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/React.Fragment&gt; ); }\" /></p>\n<p>This can be fixed by using a <code>Fragment</code> instead of a <code>div</code>. All you have to do is to replace <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/React.Fragment&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.025.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>As a result the component returns the contents without extra markup.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.026.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Summary of tip 4: Fragments help you write valid HTML and they reduce bloat. There’s also a shorter syntax, you can write <code>&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/React.Fragment&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Check out the Fragments docs for more details and examples.</p>\n<h3><abbr title=\"acessibility\">a11y</abbr> tip #5: Take care of focus management.</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.027.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>My fifth tip is that you should take care of focus management.</p>\n<p>React applications continuously modify the HTML DOM during runtime, sometimes leading to keyboard focus being lost or set to an unexpected element. In order to fix this, we need to manually move focus in the right direction.</p>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGyEQT8EDLs?rel=0\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"React demo: bad focusmanagement\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>If I focus this button and press Enter, a modal window pop ups. I would expect that I can access the content in the modal with my keyboard. Instead the focus is still behind the modal window because tab order always follows DOM order and the modal window is at the very end of the page.

If you use a screen reader on a server side rendered page and you click a link, the whole page loads, the title of the page is announced and the focus is on the document. With single page applications that's a little bit different.</p>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cZqdtkG-Z4M?rel=0\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"React demo: inaccessible routing (no announcement)\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>If I tab to the \"about\" link the screen reader announces the text in the link. When I click it, the page changes but the screen reader doesn't announce the change and focus stays where it is.</p>\n<p>The issue with the fact the focus doesn't move is especially visible if I click a link in the footer. I'm on the \"about\" page, I tab down to the footer links and click the \"blog\" link. The content of the page changes but I don't hear and see it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.034.jpeg\" alt=\"class About extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.section = React.createRef(); } componentDidMount(){ this.section.current.focus(); document.title = &quot;About&quot;; } render() { return ( &lt;section tabIndex=&quot;-1&quot; ref={ this.section }&gt; &lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/section&gt; ) } }\" /></p>\n<p>In order to fix it I again create a <code>ref</code>. This time to get access to a reference to the <code>section</code> DOM element.<br />\nI add the <code>tabindex</code> attribute with the value <code>-1</code> to make the <code>section</code> focusable. I focus it on <code>componentDidMount</code>.</p>\n<p>And while I'm at it I also update the document title.</p>\n<p>VoiceOver will now announce the whole region, so the heading and the text. I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it, I prefer to be as close to the native behaviour as possible. That's why I want to announce just the title of the page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.035.jpeg\" alt=\"render() {return (&lt;section aria-labelledby=&quot;pageTitle&quot; tabIndex=&quot;-1&quot; ref= { this.section }&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;pageTitle&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;) }\" /></p>\n<p>One way to do that is to label the focused region with the text in the heading.</p>\n<p>I give the heading an <code>id</code> and reference it in the section by adding the <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute with the <code>id</code> as a value. Now the <code>section</code> is labelled by the content of the heading. The difference is that screen readers will on focus just read the content of the heading instead of everything.</p>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YTtqT4JvuU?rel=0\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"React demo: accessible routing\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>If I do all that, the focus moves to the <code>section</code>, announces the content of the heading as well the information that focus is on a region.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.036.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>There’s a router called Reach Router that does these things and more out-of-the-box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reach.tech/router\">https://reach.tech/router</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1549208913/articles/react-finland/accessible_react_apps.037.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Summary of tip 7: Announce page changes.

<a href=\"/blog/the-dark-side-of-the-grid/\">part 1</a>, I addressed the issue with flattening document structures. Before we talk about changing visual order, let me enlighten you with more Pink Floyd wisdom.</p>\n<div class=\"fact lazy u-full-width\">\n<div class=\"fact__inner\">\n<h2 id=\"floyd-fact-1\" class=\"fact__heading\">Pink Floyd Fun Fact #2</h2>\n<p>In 1975, Pink Floyd helped to finance the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail by the comedy group Monty Python. Led Zeppelin and Genesis were also amongst the investors.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Visual order</h3>\n<p>The CSS Grid Layout specification provides us with many ways of changing visual order. This flexibility is a nice thing to have but bad for accessibility if we don’t use it consciously.<br />\nBefore we look at what’s possible with Grid, let’s briefly talk about visual order.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Both tab order and the order in which screen readers read content follow DOM order.</li>\n<li>Changing visual order with CSS has no effect on DOM order.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No matter where we place items with CSS, keyboard users will still encounter elements in the order in which they appear in the HTML document.</p>\n<div class=\"js-a-focus-demo\" data-button=\"Show tab order\">\n  <h4>Visual order matches DOM order</h4>\n  <ul class=\"a-grid-order\">\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"1\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text\">{ &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"2\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text\">{ &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"3\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text\">{ &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"4\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text\">{ &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"5\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text\">{ &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"6\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text\">{ &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"js-a-focus-demo\" data-button=\"Show tab order\"> \n  <h4>Visual order doesn’t match DOM order</h4>\n  <ul class=\"a-grid-order\">\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"1\" style=\"order: 1\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text\">{ &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"4\" style=\"order: 4\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link a-grid-order__link--mismatch no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text a-grid-order__text--mismatch\">{ &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"2\" style=\"order: 2\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link a-grid-order__link--mismatch no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text a-grid-order__text--mismatch\">{ &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"6\" style=\"order: 6\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link a-grid-order__link--mismatch no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text a-grid-order__text--mismatch\">{ &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"5\" style=\"order: 5\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text\">{ &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-order__item\" data-number=\"3\" style=\"order: 3\">\n      <a class=\"a-grid-order__link a-grid-order__link--mismatch no-line\" href=\"#\">\n        <span class=\"a-grid-order__text a-grid-order__text--mismatch\">{ &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; }</span>\n      </a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Disconnect between content and presentation</h3>\n<p>If the visual order and the DOM order don’t match, it can irritate and confuse users up to a point where the experience is so bad that the site is unusable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visual order concerns keyboard users because they may have trouble predicting where focus will go next.</li>\n<li>It may irritate <a href=\"https://axesslab.com/make-site-accessible-screen-magnifiers/\">users of screen magnifiers</a> if the enlarged portion of the screen skips around a lot.</li>\n<li>If a blind user is working with a sighted user, who reads the page in visual order, it may confuse them when they encounter information in different order.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Manipulating visual order</h3>\n<p>When you’re applying any property that changes order, you should especially pay attention to testing with a keyboard. Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> keys to test if your website is usable without a mouse.</p>\n<p>This applies to all properties, not just to those associated with CSS Grid. <br />\nHowever, I'll focus on manipulating order in grids.</p>\n<h3>Explicit placement</h3>\n<p>One of the most exciting features in Grid is the ability to place grid items anywhere inside or outside of the grid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1557599128/articles/dark-grid/grid-explicit.png\" alt=\"Visualization of the lines in a 3 by 2 grid\" /></p>\n<p>You can place items explicitly by defining on which line they start or end. For vertical lines, there’s <code>grid-column-start</code>, <code>grid-column-end</code>, or the shorthand <code>grid-column</code>. For horizontal lines, <code>grid-row-start</code>, <code>grid-row-end</code>, and <code>grid-row</code>. These rules allow a line number (either positive or negative) or the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column#Values\">span keyword</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"grid__item\"&gt;Item 1&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"grid__item\"&gt;Item 2&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"grid__item\"&gt;Item 3&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"grid__item\"&gt;Item 4&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The order in the DOM in this grid is <em>Item 1 - 2 - 3 - 4</em>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.grid {\n  /* Draw a grid...*/\n  display: grid;\n  /* with 2 200px columns. */\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 200px);\n  /* Make all rows 100px high... */\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n  /* and add 15px space between cells. */\n  grid-gap: 15px;\n}\n\n/* Place item on the second horizontal and vertical line */\n.grid__item:nth-child(2) {\n  grid-column: 2;\n  grid-row: 2;\n}\n\n/* Place item on the first horizontal and vertical line */\n.grid__item:nth-child(4) {\n  grid-column: 1;\n  grid-row: 1;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The order in the DOM is still <em>Item 1 - 2 - 3 - 4</em> but the visual order is now <em>Item 4 - 1 - 3 - 2</em>.</p>\n<p>Explicit placement might create a mismatch between DOM order and visual order.</p>\n<div class=\"a-grid-explicit js-a-focus-demo\" data-button=\"Show tab order\">\n  <ul class=\"a-grid-explicit__items\">\n    <li class=\"a-grid-explicit__item\">\n      <button type=\"button\" class=\"a-grid-explicit__button\">Item 1</button>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-explicit__item\">\n      <button type=\"button\" class=\"a-grid-explicit__button\">Item 2</button>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-explicit__item\">\n      <button type=\"button\" class=\"a-grid-explicit__button\">Item 3</button>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"a-grid-explicit__item\">\n      <button type=\"button\" class=\"a-grid-explicit__button\">Item 4</button>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Auto flow</h3>\n<p>Explicitly placing items that have the same size is one thing, but placing differently sized items may have unexpected side effects with Grids default auto-placement algorithm. The combination of explicit and implicit placement sometimes results in unwanted gaps between grid items. This is because of the default placement algorithm only ever moving forward when placing items and never backtracking to fill holes.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);\n  grid-auto-rows: 40px;\n  grid-gap: 20px;\n}\n\n/* You can use the span keyword to make items span multiple columns or rows. */\n.item:nth-child(1) {\n  grid-row-end: span 3;\n}\n.item:nth-child(3) {\n  grid-row-end: span 3;\n}\n.item:nth-child(4) {\n  grid-column: span 2;\n}\n.item:nth-child(5) {\n  grid-row: span 2;\n}\n.item:nth-child(7) {\n  grid-column: 2 / span 2;\n}\n.item:nth-child(8) {\n  grid-column: 2 / span 3;\n}\n.item:nth-child(9) {\n  grid-row: span 2;\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"js-a-focus-demo\" data-button=\"Show tab order\">\n<div class=\"a-grid-flow\">\n  <button type=\"button\">1</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">2</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">3</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">4</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">5</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">6</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">7</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">8</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">9</button>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This can give your designs a nice touch, but it can also annoy. Grid's default auto-placement algorithm can be changed by switching from a “sparse” to a “dense” packing mode using the <code>grid-auto-flow</code> property.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 200px);\n  grid-auto-rows: 70px;\n  grid-gap: 20px;\n\n  grid-auto-flow: dense;\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"js-a-focus-demo\" data-button=\"Show tab order\">\n<div class=\"a-grid-flow dense\">\n  <button type=\"button\">1</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">2</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">3</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">4</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">5</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">6</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">7</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">8</button>\n  <button type=\"button\">9</button>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This is a dream come true but the advantage of the default packing mode is that order stays intact which isn’t guaranteed with <code>grid-auto-flow: dense;</code>.</p>\n<p>Play with the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/pONEzJ?editors=1100\">auto-flow demo on CodePen</a> or read more about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow\">grid-auto-flow on MDN</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"info\">\n<h4><span class=\"info__label\">Aaahhmmm</span><span class=\"info__heading\">Implicit, explicit, whatisit?</span></h4>\n<p>If you’re not sure what I mean by explicit and implicit, head over to CSS-Tricks and read about the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/difference-explicit-implicit-grids/\" rel=\"noopener\">difference between explicit and implicit grids</a>.</p></div>\n<h3>Order</h3>\n<p>You might already be familiar with the <code>order</code> property because it has been around since Flexbox. <code>order</code> can be set to any integer value to change the ordering of flex items. This also works with grid items.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 200px);\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n  grid-gap: 1.4rem;\n}\n\n.grid__item:nth-child(2) {\n  order: 4;\n}\n\n.grid__item:nth-child(4) {\n  order: 1;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/XooEXd\">See the order property demo on CodePen</a> or read more about the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order\">order property on MDN</a>.</p>\n<h3>Absolute positioning</h3>\n<p>It’s possible to combine absolute positioning and explicit placement. I haven’t found a use case yet in any of my projects but it’s interesting how a positioned item behaves inside a grid.</p>\n<p>In the following 3 by 2 grid with 6 items I’m moving the second item from line 2 to line 3 by applying <code>grid-column: 3</code>. Since I haven’t set the row property explicitly and I haven’t placed other items, all subsequent items move one cell with the explicitly placed item. DOM order still matches visual order.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 200px);\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n  grid-gap: 1.4rem;\n}\n\nli:nth-child(2) {\n  /* Move the second item to the third vertical line */\n  grid-column: 3;\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"js-a-focus-demo\" data-button=\"Show tab order\">\n<ul class=\"a-grid-absolute\">\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 1</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 2</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 3</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 4</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 5</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 6</button></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Now let’s see what happens if we add absolute positioning to the mix and position the item in the top left corner relative to its parent.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\nli:nth-child(2) {\n  grid-column: 3;\n\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  top: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Positioned grid items lie on top of other items just like any absolute positioned element. They don’t affect the position of other items, and they’re completely ignored during auto-placement.\\<br />\nThis is where it gets interesting: setting <code>left</code> and <code>top</code> to <code>0</code> doesn’t place them in the top left corner of their parent item (the <code>ul</code>) but in the cell they’re placed in.</p>\n<div class=\"js-a-focus-demo\" data-button=\"Show tab order\">\n<ul class=\"a-grid-absolute\">\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 1</button></li>\n  <li class=\"positioned\"><button type=\"button\">Item 2</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 3</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 4</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 5</button></li>\n  <li><button type=\"button\">Item 6</button></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Again, this may cause a disconnect between content and presentation.</p>\n<h3>Areas</h3>\n<p>Time to make a confession: I’m deeply in love with Grid Areas ❤️. I’ll share my intense feelings about this property in another article soon. Areas are awesome, but nobody is perfect and since this article deals with the dark side of things, let’s see what may go wrong.</p>\n<p>The <code>grid-template-areas</code> property does 2 things. <br />\nFirst, it describes layouts in CSS visually. If you have a 2-column layout with a header, content, sidebar and a footer, this is what it may look like in CSS.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.layout {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\n  grid-template-areas:\n    'header header'\n    'content sidebar'\n    'footer footer';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Second, it defines named grid areas where any grid item may be placed inside.</p>\n<p>Let’s take this example where the source order is wrong.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;footer&gt;Footer&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n  &lt;header&gt;Header&lt;/header&gt;\n\n  &lt;main&gt;Main&lt;/main&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The source order of these elements is <em>footer - header - main</em>, where it should be <em>header - main - footer</em>. The correct approach to fixing this is to change the order in HTML but with Areas we don’t have to.<br />\nAll it takes is to define the correct layout in CSS and then place the elements in the respective area using the <code>grid-area</code> property.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  display: grid;\n  /* Three single column, single row areas */\n  grid-template-areas:\n    'header'\n    'content'\n    'footer';\n}\n\nfooter {\n  /* place the footer in the third row/area */\n  grid-area: footer;\n}\n\nheader {\n  /* place the header in the first row/area */\n  grid-area: header;\n}\n\nmain {\n  /* place the main element in the second row/area */\n  grid-area: content;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>This is so simple, so beautiful, yet so dangerous. It looks right, but the order is only correct on the surface because the source order is still the same.</p>\n<div class=\"js-a-focus-demo\" data-button=\"Show tab order\">\n<div class=\"a-grid-areas\">\n<div class=\"footer\">\n  <button type=\"button\">Footer</button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"header\">\n  <button type=\"button\">Header</button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n  <button type=\"button\">Main</button>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Recap</h2>\n<p>None of these features are bad, but just they may affect an important part of the user experience negatively.

It’s something you can proudly share with your client or on Twitter.</p>\n<p>It’s important to measure the quality of our code, but it’s even more important that we interpret the scores automatic testing tools give us correctly. If Lighthouse tells us that our site is 100% accessible, it doesn’t mean it is. It just means we’ve laid the groundwork for manual testing. Lighthouse uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core\">axe-core</a> accessibility testing library with a <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/ad0a747a712b815677b6ea3bcc59ee7a0883426d/lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/accessibility.js#L26-L50\">custom set of rules</a> for its tests. It identifies some bad practices, but not all of them. Other practices aren’t bad per se, but can be harmful, if we misuse them.</p>\n<p>With automatic testing alone you can’t ensure good quality. To prove that, I built the most inaccessible site possible with a perfect Lighthouse score.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Zach Leatherman recently posted this on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1122184546609446919\">twitter</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Free blog post idea:</p>\n<p>How to Build the Slowest Website with a Perfect Lighthouse Score</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pepelsbey_/status/1122203926584074240\">Vadim Makeev’s response</a> to his tweet, which inspired me to write this post.</p>\n<blockquote>That would be a wonderful read!

I want to make sure that CSS is a dependency on my perfect website. To achieve that I'm adding the <code>hidden</code> attribute to the <code>body</code> element. <code>hidden</code> is the HTML equivalent to <code>display: none;</code> in CSS. (Checkout <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html\">Inclusively Hidden</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottohara\">Scott O’Hara</a>, if you want to learn more about accessible hiding).</p>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>HTML</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;body hidden&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\n<img alt=\"A blank page\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/4b7154486f-1698841509/lighthouse_step2.png\">\n<p><code>hidden</code> hides content visually, and it removes it from the accessibility tree. That alone would be enough to exclude everyone and pass the Lighthouse tests, but I don’t want to make it too easy on myself. I want to create a site that’s perfectly inaccessible and technically still displays content.<br />\nSo let’s add some CSS and bring our content back.</p>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>HTML</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=\"loaded\" hidden&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>CSS</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.loaded {\n  display: block;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>We’re back to where we were before but now CSS must load if users want to get access to content on our site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s.codepen.io/matuzo/pen/QRZmrJ\">CodePen: “100%” accessible - step 1</a></p>\n<h3>🖕 JS only 🖕</h3>\n<p>Let’s add one more dependency. I’m not applying the class that displays our content in HTML anymore, but I add it via JS.</p>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>HTML</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" /&gt;\n  &lt;script src=\"script.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body hidden&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>JS</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.querySelector('body').classList.add('loaded');</code></pre>\n<p>Great! The site still looks the same but in order for it to display anything at all the CSS and JS file must load and work properly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s.codepen.io/matuzo/pen/GaYxLx\">CodePen: “100%” accessible - step 2</a></p>\n<p>I'd say it's time for our first Lighthouse test.

The easiest and most efficient way is to use the <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> attribute and value. This attribute is powerful and we must apply it with caution, because it removes elements from the accessibility tree. Normally, we may only use it to improve the experience for users of assistive technologies by <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/states_and_properties#aria-hidden\">removing redundant or extraneous content</a>.<br />\nIn our website we’re putting it on the <code>body</code> element.</p>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>HTML</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;body hidden aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Screen reader users will now experience one of those <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/\"><em>“rare”</em> moments</a> when they have to deal with an inaccessible site. <span aria-label=\"(sarcasm)\" title=\"(sarcasm)\">*</span></p>\n<p><strong>Update 06.10.21</strong>: Originally, Lighthouse didn’t flag this as an issue, but they seem to have fixed it.

    "partialText": "<p>I don’t consider myself a web accessibility expert but I’ve learned enough in a relatively short time to feel comfortable enough to share my knowledge in blog posts, workshops and talks. </p>\n<p>Here’s some advice, if you want to share stuff but are wary about doing it.</p><h2>1. Find something that interests you and stick to it.</h2>\n<p>Fullstack is bullshit and so is trying to be an expert in everything. Pick that one thing that interests you the most (design, js, css, a11y, ux,…) and try to be really good in that specific area.</p>\n<p>(PS: it can change over time)</p>\n<h2>2. Read, read a lot.</h2>\n<p>Find experts in the area that interests you and subscribe to their blogs and follow them on social media. Read as many articles as you can. If you can afford it, buy books or videos. If not, ask the author if they’ve got promo codes for you (some do that).</p>\n<h2>3. Share!</h2>\n<p>I learn the most by explaining stuff to others. If you want to learn something, write an article about it or give a talk at a meetup. You can do that even if you’re not an “expert”. I did that with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-css-with-accessibility-in-mind-8514a0007939\">this article</a> and it helped me and many others.</p>\n<h2>4. Share even if it has been shared before.</h2>\n<p>Don’t limit yourself to topics and content that hasn’t been shared before. New perspectives, ideas and approaches to old topics are often interesting and valuable.</p>\n<h2>5. Don’t be afraid to write/talk about basics.</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to feel intimidated by the seemingly endless knowledge of people you follow on twitter. For every person who knows more about something than you, there are many more that know less and would enjoy you sharing “basics”.</p>\n<h2>6. Don’t be afraid to ask for feedback.</h2>\n<p>Before I published my first few articles about accessibility, I asked people I look up to (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AArdrian\">@aardrian</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heydonworks\">@heydonworks</a> and others) to give me feedback. I figured if they don’t think it’s shit, it probably isn’t. I still do this with every article I write (by the way, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cariefisher\">@cariefisher</a> expect a DM next week :)).</p>\n<h2>7. Publish on your own website.</h2>\n<p>It’s not just that the quality of third party platforms like Medium might decrease at some point, but you also feel much more comfortable expressing yourself and sharing stuff if it happens on your personal website. (+ you own the content.)</p>\n<h2>8. Find a mentor.</h2>\n<p>Okay, I don’t know where you would find one but if someone you respect offers you their support, take it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson\">@AaronGustafson</a> was my mentor for a year and he helped me in so many aspects.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDon%27t+be+afraid+to+share%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Beyond automatic accessibility testing: 6 things I check on every website I build",
    "partialText": "<p>I just finished an accessibility audit for a client and I decided to share some quick checks I perform in every site I audit and build. It’s something that you can apply to your project right away, you don’t have to learn a tool or a software.</p><h2>Step 0: Automatic tests</h2>\n<p>The first thing I do is run accessibility checks in <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\">Lighthouse</a> to figure out if anything obvious is wrong. Automatic accessibility tests are great but they only check a subset of what needs to be tested. <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/\">If you have a score of 100 or 0 errors, you’re not done</a>. It just means you’ve laid the groundwork for manual testing.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Check image descriptions</h2>\n<p>The first semi-manual test I perform is check if images have descriptions and if they’re described correctly. I’m using a browser extension called <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/web-developer/\">Web Developer</a> for that. You can highlight images that have no <code>alt</code> attribute or display the value of <code>alt</code> attributes next to images.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1571155703/articles/a11y-test/a11y_tips_step1.jpg\" alt=\"The images settings section in Web Developer toolbar.\" /></p>\n<h2>Step 2: Disable all styles</h2>\n<p>Another feature of the Web Developer extension is the ability to disable CSS on a page. If you disable CSS, you’re able to check various things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the website work without CSS (in case it doesn’t load)?</li>\n<li>Does the order of elements of your page make sense?</li>\n<li>Are images and icons sized correctly?</li>\n<li>Is your document well structured?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1571155700/articles/a11y-test/a11y_tips_step2.jpg\" alt=\"The schedule page on webclerks.at displayed without CSS.\" /></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Validate HTML</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/\">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> to check your markup. The Validation Service doesn’t catch everything, but it’s great for finding obvious bugs in your HTML, like duplicate <code>id</code>s or broken aria references.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1571155701/articles/a11y-test/a11y_tips_step3.jpg\" alt=\"Random errors on the w3c validator results page.\" /></p>\n<h2>Step 4: Check the document outline</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/#finding\">A sound document outline is important</a>. It should start with a <code>h1</code> followed by <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, etc. in hierarchical order. This is great for search engines and screen reader users because they might navigate your site by jumping from one heading to another.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1571155700/articles/a11y-test/a11y_tips_step4.jpg\" alt=\"List of the headings on webclerks.at. tota11y screenshot.\" /></p>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/\">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> to check your outline or a tool called <a href=\"https://khan.github.io/tota11y/\">tota11y</a> (as seen in the screenshot above).</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Grayscale mode</h2>\n<p>I’m using a browser extension called <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph\">High Contrast</a> to display sites in grayscale mode.\\<br />\nThis is an important check because it will tell you if parts of your design work with color only. You should make sure you don’t convey information with color alone. A perfect example are links, they should have underlines to easily differentiate them from normal text. <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2019/01/underlines-are-beautiful.html\">Underlines are beautiful</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Underline your fucking links you sociopaths.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>- Heydon Pickering</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1571204684/articles/a11y-test/a11y_tips_step5.png\" alt=\"The Smashing Magazine website works in black and white.\" /></p>\n<p>You don’t have to install a browser extension, you can also use <a href=\"https://github.com/matuzo/a11y-tests.css\">CSS to achieve a similar effect</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  filter: grayscale(100%);\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 6: Use the keyboard</h2>\n<p>Put your mouse away and tab through the page and see if you can use every single part of the site without a mouse/touch pad. The <kbd>tab</kbd> key is a powerful testing tool, it will tell you a lot about your site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are focus styles clearly visible?</li>\n<li>Is everything focusable that should be?</li>\n<li>Are your buttons real <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s?</li>\n<li>Is the overall UX using a keyboard great?</li>\n<li>Are you managing focus correctly?</li>\n<li>Do you hide and show elements correctly?</li>\n<li>Does visual order match DOM order?</li>\n<li>Can you use custom JS components without a mouse?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s even a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/no-mouse-days\">npm package for disabling the mouse cursor</a>, built by the wonderful <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s not the end of the story. There are more things that you should check, but that’s it for now. I’ll share more in another post. :)</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CBeyond+automatic+accessibility+testing%3A+6+things+I+check+on+every+website+I+build%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

I usually do it on my website <a href=\"https://matuzo.at\">matuzo.at</a>. <em>Matuzo</em> is my nickname and <em>at</em> is the top-level domain for Austria. I write articles about CSS and accessibility and sometimes I also publish on other websites where write about the same topics.</p>\n<p><em>[Showing articles I've published on <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/enhancing-css-layout-floats-flexbox-grid/\">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/flex-grow-is-weird/\">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/my-accessibility-journey-what-ive-learned-so-far/\">A List Apart</a></em></p>\n<p>I also like to give talks at meetups and conferences, and now I decided to share on another medium, which is video.</p>\n<p>I already have a website and I want to redesign it for different reasons.</p>\n<p>The first reason is that I made some bad decisions when it comes to using custom properties and there are also some other CSS things that I want to improve and I also want to extend what's on my website.<br />\nRight now you can see on my home page the latest blog posts and you can click a blog post. It's a pretty basic layout. It looks nice, at least if you ask me.<br />\nMost articles look the same but some are different, some of them are branded, for example here you can see a a post for a <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/12-tips-for-more-accessible-react-apps-slides-react-finland-2019/\">talk that I gave in Finland</a>, at <a href=\"https://react-finland.fi\">React Finland</a>. I branded it in the colours of Finland and the event, blue and white.<br />\nHere you can see a post called <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/the-dark-side-of-the-grid-part-2/\">\"The Dark Side of the Grid\"</a>. I stole the design of the \"Dark Side of the Moon\" which is an LP by Pink Floyd and I branded the whole article in this design. I like that, it's a bit more work but it looks nice and I also like that not all articles look the same.</p>\n<p>Besides my blog there is a page <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/about-me/\">about me</a>, it's pretty boring, there isn’t too much on it, I want to extend that a bit I want to go into detail about my workshops and my speaking and so on.</p>\n<p>There’s a <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/til/\">today I learned page</a>, it's called today I learned because I share a thing that I've learned that day in a<br />\nsentence or two. I stole that idea from reddit, there is a subreddit called <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/\">\"today I learned\"</a> where people do exactly the same thing but I put it on my<br />\nwebsite and I share web stuff, for example the last thing is \"you can list all pseudo elements of an element in the CSS pane in Firefox developer tools\". I didn’t know that before that.</p>\n<p>Okay, so that's what's online right now and I want some more stuff. So, this is one of the reasons why I need a redesign and I also want to make a new design.<br />\nI like the current design. What I like most about it is that it's not a typical design, it doesn't look like every other website and I also like that a lot of people don't like it. I even had people tell me in my face that my website is ugly - Hi Jens! - but that's a good thing because I'd rather have a lot of people not like my website and others like it then a lot of people not care about my website because not caring means it's boring.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I want to make a new design and, yeah, this is what's going to happen in the course of the next few weeks and months and I'm going to record it.</p>\n<h3>[List of topics I'll cover]</h3>\n<p>I made a list of the topics that I'm going to cover and some of the technology that I want to use or some of the properties, techniques, whatever and I summarized it for you so that you can decide for yourself if this video, series of videos is for you or not.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I'm going to host the website on <strong><a href=\"https://netlify.com\">netlify</a></strong>, just because it's for free and it's easy and it makes deployment really<br />\neasy. I'm a big fan of netlify, they didn’t pay me to say that I'm just very convinced of the product.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'm going to use <strong><a href=\"https://netlifycms.org\">netlifyCMS</a></strong>, which is a plugin for netlify hosted websites that will magically create a content management system for your sites. You don't have to install anything, you don't need a server-side programming language or whatever. All you need is just one HTML file and I think a config JSON or YAML file and netlifyCMS will create a user interface and the content management system based on that, which is really cool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We're also going to need <strong>netlify forms</strong> because I want to<br />\nbring guest books back to the web. I made my first website about 19 years ago and every website I made until – I don't know – 2004 or 5 had a guestbook, so I want to bring that back, I don't know if bots and spammers and trolls are going to ruin that for me, but we'll try and netlify has forms, as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I won’t use any programming language like PHP or Python or Ruby to create my website, I'm going to use good old HTML but I'm not going to write HTML files.<br />\nI'll write markdown files and use <strong><a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">eleventy</a></strong>, a static site generator to create HTML files out of markdown and nunchuks files. I'm a big fan of eleventy, pretty much everything I build at the moment is based on eleventy. It's a fantastic tool, you're going to love it.<br />\nShout out to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachleat/\">Zach Leatherman</a> who built it, it's just perfect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'll talk about <strong>designing in the browser</strong> because I made a design for my web site, for my current web site and for the new one and I didn’t use Photoshop or Sketch or anything I designed it completely in the browser and I'll talk a little bit about that in the next video and how to find inspiration or at least how I find inspiration for designs as someone who's not a designer per definition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'm going to use <strong>Sass</strong> for stuff like includes and mixins and variables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We'll also cover <strong>gulp</strong> because I need gulp for minifying and uglyfiying CSS and JavaScript files, maybe some image optimization, we'll see. I don't know yet what we were going to use it for but I know that I'm going to need it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'm also going to write some <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I'm a HTML and CSS person. I understand JavaScript but I'm not the best JavaScript developer, so don't expect the best JavaScript code but there is going to be some JavaScript because I like to write JavaScript myself, so I don't like to rely too much on frameworks or plugins, for example I'm going to need lazy loading on my website and I'm going to write it on my own, just to practice JavaScript a little bit and to save some file size.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Speaking of file size, <strong>performance</strong> is going to be an important topic. I like my websites to be fast so that users have a great experience. It's a usability and user experience concern and an accessibility concern, as well. So performance is important, we're going to talk a lot about performance and I will try to make it as fast as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another important topic is <strong>accessibility</strong>. I'm an accessibility person, I care a lot about accessibility and my users and I want to make sure that as many users as possible can use my website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If I talk about accessibility of course you have to talk about <strong>progressive enhancement</strong>, as well, so I want to make sure that the website is accessible not just to as many users as possible but also to as many devices and operating systems and browsers as possible. For example, I bought this Nokia 3310 about two years ago which is a redesign of the old Nokia phone. It's a great phone, it's pretty cheap and it has a browser, Opera Mini. If you visit <a href=\"https://caniuse.com\">caniuse.com</a> and you search for a property and you see all green in every browser except for one, that's usually the browser that's installed on that phone. So, this is an interesting challenge, we're going to make this website work on my feature phone here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I already mentioned that some of the articles are themed, we have this \"Dark Side of the Grid\" article and the \"React Finland\" article. I'm going to talk about <strong>theming</strong> a lot and I'm going to try to find a new strategy on how I'm going to theme my sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There’s some CSS stuff that I want to implement like <strong>dark mode</strong>. I'm going to use <strong>CSS Grid</strong>, if it makes sense and I want to use <strong>custom properties</strong>, ideally in a smart way, we'll see how we're going to use them, if we're going to use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dev tools</strong> is another important topic, I like to use dev tools a lot and use as many features as possible of dev tools and I'm going to talk a lot about that and see if I can find something that you don't know already about dev tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We might talk about <strong>puppeteer</strong> as well because for the <em>today I learned</em> section I want to have the ability to add code and when I publish it I want to run a script that will take a screenshot of this code sample that I wrote and use it as the preview image on social media and I guess that puppeteer can do that for me.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another thing is that I want to make the website available offline, so it's going to be a <strong>progressive web app</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There’s some other JavaScript stuff and indie web stuff like <strong>web mention</strong> that I want to implement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I want to show you how I test for accessibility and performance and how I do <strong>browser testing</strong> to make sure that my website works the way I expect it to work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's a lot, I don't know how many videos I'm going to record, I don't know how often I'm going to publish a video, if it's going to be every two weeks or three weeks. I just don't know how much work it is to create a video, we'll see.</p>\n<p>That's it for the first video. What I need now is your feedback, please tell me if this is interesting, if I caught your attention, if you are waiting for the next video to publish and also please tell me if the audio quality is<br />\ngood enough, if the video quality is good enough. I'm actually just using my smartphone to record this and also please tell me if<br />\nyou can understand me, I know that my English isn’t perfect but I just hope that my accent is understandable at least understandable enough. Yeah, that's it, thank you so much for watching.<br />\nSee you next time ❤️</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9Cmatuzo.at+from+scratch+%230+-+introduction%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>When I talk about web accessibility at meet-ups and conferences, it’s safe to assume that at least one person will ask me something like “Yeah, accessibility sounds nice, but how many people are actually disabled? How many of my users are blind? And why would a blind person visit my website?”</p><h2>1. Who gives a fuck?!</h2>\n<p>We’re not building websites for ourselves or our stakeholders, we’re building them for our users, for actual human beings. It’s our job to enable as many people as possible to use what we build. Everything else makes little sense. There’s no point in building something that can’t be used. Stop making assumptions about your audience and start building inclusive products.</p>\n<h2>2. It's not just about disabilities</h2>\n<p>Web accessibility is not just about keyboard users, color contrast or screen readers. Accessibility is a perfect indicator for the quality of a website. Accessibility is strongly interlocked with other areas of web design and web development. If your website is accessible, it usually means that it’s inclusive, resilient, usable, it offers great <abbr title=\"user experience\">UX</abbr> for everyone, and it’s fast.</p>\n<p>Here’s a simplified example and the reason for this rant:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;li&gt;\n  &lt;div tabindex=\"0\" class=\"link\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"preview.jpg\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Yesterday I was looking at a list with 70 preview images that link to detail pages. I wanted to open a few of them in new tabs. Easy, right?<br />\nNo, because the developers decided to wrap these images in <code>div</code>s and link them with Javascript instead of using an anchor. I could left-click and open a single prototype in the same window, but I couldn’t right-click and open in a new window, because there are different options in the context menu when you right-click a <code>div</code> or an anchor.</p>\n<h3>Semantic HTML is beneficial for everyone.</h3>\n<p>Using <code>a</code> instead of <code>div</code> gives links a semantic meaning, users more options when using a mouse and it makes links keyboard focusable. Although – and this is the paradox – the list was keyboard accessible, because they made their <code>div</code>-links focusable with JavaScript instead of taking advantage of the browsers native behaviour.</p>\n<p>This is just a minor problem and others have to deal with much bigger barriers every day, but this example is characteristic for how carelessly we sometimes treat our users.</p>\n<p>Bad accessibility affects all of us at some point, please (re)learn HTML and take advantage of its fantastic features.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CBad+accessibility+equals+bad+quality%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

I'm a front-end developer from Vienna and I'm redesigning and building my website from scratch, and I'm recording it. This is my second video, thank you so much for the great feedback to my first video and also thank you so much for subscribing to my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj29HII0sgJvKhqPIrO6Skw\">YouTube channel</a>. I started with 5 subscribers and now I have 102, which is really really amazing.</p>\n<p>In my first video I talked about my plans for the next couple of weeks, the technology I'm going to use and what I'm going to cover and what I want to implement. One thing I didn’t tell you about – and thank you Bernd for pointing this out – is the required skill level that you will need in order to be able to follow me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"skills\">[Required skills you'll need]</h3>\n<p>If you are completely new to <strong>eleventy</strong>, it's absolutely fine. I'm doing a lot of research right now, I'm looking at other websites and I'm trying to steal all the great ideas so they can find their way into my website, and I'm going to start from zero and explain everything that I'm doing.<br />\nSo, if you're new to eleventy, this is going to be great for you.</p>\n<p>If you're completely new to <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, if you don't know how to write HTML and CSS, I believe that it's going to be hard for you to follow me because I'm not going to talk about the language basics. I'm going to talk about some basics of HTML, of course, and CSS, as well, but also about some advanced stuff and I'm not going to explain the fundamentals.<br />\nYou might want to learn HTML and CSS first and then come back because there is some stuff like performance and theming in CSS and also advanced layout that I'm not going to explain in detail.</p>\n<p>All the <strong>JavaScript</strong> stuff is probably going to be pretty basic because I already told you in the first video I'm not a JavaScript pro. I know how to write JavaScript but it's not going to be the most advanced JavaScript, or you don't need any framework knowledge (React, Vue, whatever) because I'm going to write vanilla JavaScript.</p>\n<p>My JavaScript might get better because I just subscribed to <a href=\"https://justjavascript.com/\">“Just JavaScript”</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a>, a JavaScript course that helps you write vanilla JavaScript. It seems like he's planning to create the best vanilla JavaScript course there is, together with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mappletons\">Maggie Appleton</a>. I'm really looking forward to this, you might want to subscribe.</p>\n<p>So, if you know basic HTML and basic CSS, I guess my videos are going to be interesting for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"design\">[How I approach design]</h3>\n<p>Let’s get started with the topic for today, I want to talk about design and finding inspiration. I'm a front-end<br />\ndeveloper, I get paid to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I don't do design but I believe that I have to understand how design works and I should be able to do some basic design because my job is to translate Sketch, Photoshop, sometimes even InDesign to CSS and HTML. In order to be able to<br />\ntranslate I need to understand both languages, so the languages of the web and also the language of design.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't trust myself to build a design system or to design a large website with many different components and states, and so on, but I trust myself to build my own website and I also challenge myself to design my own website and this is really important.<br />\nYour website is your personal space, this is where you get to express yourself. You can express yourself by the content, the images, the text that you put online and you also get to express yourself and show who you are with your design. That's why I believe that it's important that <em>you</em> design your website, but for some people, including me, it's hard to design and the way I do it, and this kind of works for me, is that I have a starting point and that starting point is usually something that inspires me, and I'm going to talk about that in a second.</p>\n<p>So, I have this starting point and then I just design, I just start and what I don't do is that I don't sit down for a day and try to come up with a design.<br />\nI only take a few minutes, maybe 30 minutes or up to one hour maybe, because I work full-time I don't have the time and it's also for me easier to design and not get frustrated if I don't spend too much time on it because if I design something for two hours and I'm not able to come up with the result that I expect I get frustrated and if I only have a limited amount of time, this is not very likely to happen.</p>\n<h4>[Spend only 30 - 90 minutes every day on design]</h4>\n<p>So the way I do it is, in the morning I have about 30 to 90 minutes before I have to get to work, I wake up very early, yes, and I work on a design and I work on it for 30 minutes and then I just let it be and the next morning I look at it and if I still like it, I keep on working. If I don't like it, I throw it away and then in the next morning I repeat this, and so on. The tip I have for you: If design is hard for you, don't try to design everything in one go, like you can, I don't know, write the HTML and CSS and JavaScript for a component in a day and then you're finished and it's fine, but I wouldn't recommend to take a whole day to work on a design.</p>\n<p>Take your time, spend multiple days looking at the design, iterating over it and tweaking it and maybe just throwing stuff away, if you don't like it anymore, it's fine just try something else but just take your time and while you're designing also try to work on other stuff on your website because there’s so much you have to do. Don't let the design be a blocker, you don't need the design before you start working.</p>\n<h4>[Don't let the design block you]</h4>\n<p>You can do all the server setup, you can, in my case, setup eleventy, you can create all the content, write everything, work on the HTML and the<br />\ndesign could be the last thing that you have to do, so don't let a design be a blocker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inspiration\">[Finding inspiration]</h3>\n<p>I just mentioned that I usually have this one thing that I start with, like this foundation of my design, something that inspires me. And inspiration is an interesting topic because there are different ways or different sources where you can get inspiration from.</p>\n<h4>[Don't look at other websites too early]</h4>\n<p>I'm going to start with the most obvious one, which is looking at other websites. This is something that I definitely cannot recommend. Don't look at other websites because if you look at other websites, it might happen that they influence you in your decision-making and design process so much that there isn’t too much of your personality, of “you” in your design and, again, I believe this is important because you express yourself with the design of your website. So, looking at other websites too early in this process might influence you too much and the chances are high that your website will look like every other website.</p>\n<p>There is this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jongold/status/694591217523363840\">famous tweet by John Gold</a> who wrote “Which one<br />\nof the two possible websites are you currently designing” and you see this one design with the logo on the left side, a horizontal navigation on the right side followed by a hero area with an image and some tags, a call-to-action button followed by several sections with one to three columns. This is how most websites look like and if you look at too many websites of other people, it might happen that you just create another clone of all the other websites.</p>\n<h4>[Fonts]</h4>\n<p>So, if I don't recommend looking at other websites too early, what do I recommend?<br />\nWell, you could start with pretty much anything, you can start with a font for example. You just visit, I don't know, <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/\">Google Fonts</a> and just browse through the fonts, maybe don't take the first ones, don't start with Open Sans or Roboto.<br />\nScroll through the page and see if there’s a font that you like and use this as a starting point or, of course, you can also visit – I don't know how to pronounce it – font squirrel, font squirrel, font squirrel, I don't know, <a href=\"https://www.fontsquirrel.com/\">font squirrel</a>. You can browse this website and see if there are free fonts that you can use, that inspire you to create a design. They have a lot of interesting fonts on there.</p>\n<h4>[Colors]</h4>\n<p>So, a font could be something that inspires you and also a color, for example. There’s <a href=\"https://color.adobe.com/explore\">Adobe color</a>, there are other websites as well, that have color swatches and you just browse through the site and see if there is a combination of colors that you like and use this as a starting point.</p>\n<h4>[dribbble.com]</h4>\n<p>Another source of inspiration is <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\">dribbble.com</a>, and I guess they're different ways of<br />\nusing dribbble.com. On <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/search/website\">this page</a> I searched for “website” and you can see some designs and the problem I have with dribbble is that some of the designs are just too beautiful, just too perfect and if I look at this page, everything looks the same to me because, I don't know if I'm using dribble wrong, but there is usually a trend, a certain type of design or usage of color or typography that everyone is doing at the moment and this is why most designs look the same at least they look the same to me.<br />\nI don't know if this is a great source for finding inspiration but what I like about dribbble is, you can search for logos or whatever and just see if you can find colors that interest you. So, it doesn't have to be a user interface design, it could be just a logo that you like and if you click on it, you can see the color swatch and you can copy the colors and you can also click one of the colors and then you will see all kinds of designs and combinations with other colors in that specific color. So, this is really cool.</p>\n<h4>[Magazines]</h4>\n<p>Another source of inspiration, it is my favorite one, is the offline world.<br />\nYou can find inspiration anywhere in the offline world, for example, you can look at books or magazines. This is an <a href=\"https://www.dan-davies.co.uk/print-to-css\">article<br />\nthat Dan Davies wrote</a> and it's called “Print to CSS”. He says that he's a huge fan of magazine layouts and the use of typography and structures and the general look and he wanted to bring that look to the web. And for him it was an interesting exercise because he got to practice Grid and he also made some pretty cool designs.<br />\nHe looked at several magazines and he recreated the layouts in CSS. You can see for example, this is pretty interesting, he's using the heading of the article as a mask on an image, which looks nice and it seems like you can do this with CSS. So, pretty cool stuff, stuff that might inspire you.</p>\n<h4>[Architecture]</h4>\n<p><em>[Showing photos of buildings I took in Talinn]</em></p>\n<p>Another source of inspiration in the offline world is architecture – I'm a huge fan of architecture – my partner's an architect and whenever we travel she shows me all kinds of interesting buildings. What you see here are just some photos I took in Estonia and they have so many awesome buildings there and, of course I know this is a building, you can’t immediately transform this into a web layout like we just saw with the magazines but – I don't know – texture, color, combination of colors and also sometimes shapes can be very inspiring. For example look at that building, I mean this looks so interesting, all kinds of interesting shapes that you could, for example, recreate with CSS or just use it as a foundation for building something or designing something.</p>\n<p><em>[Showing a photo of a poster]</em></p>\n<p>On my current website you can see that the colors I'm using are this whitish-beige color in the background and a light blue and a dark blue color and red. And I found those colors in Italy, I was in Italy on vacation and we stayed at an AirBnB and I was brushing my teeth and usually I'm brushing my teeth everywhere but the bathroom. So I was walking around the Airbnb and I was brushing my teeth and then I saw this poster – and you can actually see me brushing my teeth here, if you look closely – and I saw it and I really liked it. I like the shapes, but not too much, but I liked the colors a lot. So, I took a photo and I saved it to my phone. At some point I used this as a basis for my design. If you look at the website again, you can see that the colors are not exactly the same but they're pretty similar.</p>\n<p><em>[Showing a punk LP]</em></p>\n<p>For my new website, for my redesigned website I already have a very rough idea for a design and the inspiration this time was a LP. I bought this punk LP a few years ago, about eight years ago. It's called “Oi of Japan” which is a compilation of Japanese punk music and a few weeks ago I remembered that I have it and I listened to it and then – I swear it was exactly like that – two days later I woke up in the middle of the night and I thought “My website should look like this cover”. So, I looked at it again and thought “Okay, how can I do it, how can I transform this into a design”.</p>\n<p>So, I opened <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a> and I started designing and this is what I came up with. You can see that the title of the LP is my name and the navigation on my website is where the bands are and I don't have an illustration here but Ibuilt a layout in a square shape or a rectangle shape and I did that and I liked it for some time and – you know – I spent 30 to 60 minutes working on it and then I worked one more day and then another day and then I woke up and I looked at it and I thought “I don't know, it looks nice, but I'm not too convinced”. I mean, I like this three column layout here, it's kind of interesting but I thought I should bring my colors back, the colors that I have on my website because I like them a lot.<br />\nSo, I changed the colors and I also changed the layout a bit and I did some experimenting and I liked that a first but a few days later I didn’t like it anymore, I didn’t like it at all so I just thought “Okay, I'm going to start from scratch. I'm going to delete everything.”, but in order to honor the original inspiration I had, this LP, I'm going to keep this square shape and I'm going to use it as a background image on my website.</p>\n<p>I opened illustrator, I created this background image, I saved it and then I got this and I thought “Man, this looks really cool” because it looks like a college block where you can write on and draw something and scribble and it also kind of… it makes me want to draw more squares on this canvas. So, that's what I did, I drew another square, so I got the original idea back and then I added my logo and the navigation here on the top right. Again, you can see that I'm really trying not to copy all the other websites. That's why I did some experimentation with the positioning and then I also added some content. Now what you can see here is not the final design, this is just a rough draft, a prototype. I'm designing in the browser and I will be working in the browser, of course, so I don't need to design the whole thing. Design here is an ongoing process, so while I'm writing the CSS the design will just happen.<br />\nOkay, so this is what I'm going to do, it will probably not look like this but it will be something in that direction, probably. It might also happen that at some point, in video 10, I don't know, I decide that I don't like it anymore and I'm going to design something else, we'll see.</p>\n<h4>[Look at other websites for inspiration]</h4>\n<p>Okay, in the very beginning I told you that I don't recommend looking at other websites. Actually I do recommend it but it shouldn't be the first thing you do.<br />\nAt some point it makes sense to look at other websites and that's also what I did.</p>\n<p>I visited it this <a href=\"https://lynnandtonic.com/\">website but Lynn Fisher</a>. Lynn Fisher is awesome. If you don't know her, follow her and check out her website. This is her site and if you make the screen smaller, you can see that on a small screen you just see – I guess it's her – her head and her name at the top and the larger the screen gets the more heads you can see. So, her head splits in the middle and then you see a skull and then all of a sudden a pizza and more different faces and in the end you you see her again, I guess, again holding it all together. This is so cool, unfortunately I'm not Lynn Fisher. I'm not as talented and creative as her and I can’t draw, I can barely write, but I still love looking at websites like hers because it inspires me to get started, to do something, to design something, to get creative, even though I can’t do stuff that she can do.</p>\n<p>Another great example is – and I guess that most of you have already seen this website by <a href=\"https://bruno-simon.com/\">Bruno Simon</a> and I don't even know how you do it, like there’s a car and you can use the arrow keys to drive around and you can explore his world, his website and this is just so cool. Like again I don't even know how…What is this? JavaScript and three.js? I don't know. It's just so so cool and, again, I'm not as talented as he is to create something like that but it inspires me.</p>\n<p>Another example is this website that I stumbled upon recently by – I'm sorry if I didn’t pronounce it correctly – <a href=\"https://www.ilithya.rocks/\">Ilithya</a> and I<br />\nspend so much time playing around with that thing, that's really really cool and I also like the colors a lot. Now, I wouldn't try to recreate this and put it on my website because that's not me. I'd like to play around with it but it looks nice and also again it's inspirational and what I like is I looked at the other pages and there are all kinds of interesting things going on. What I like here is that you can see the content is right aligned. On the left side you have this pattern, this dotted pattern and on mobile or small screens they're on the top. At some point they disappear and then reappear again. This is a nice little touch, I like that a lot and it seems like you – oh okay – you have some theming going on, which is also quite nice.</p>\n<p>If you like websites like these where a lot of animation is going on, I recommend checking out <a href=\"https://www.awwwards.com/\">awwwards.com</a>. There are a lot of really really cool sites on there.</p>\n<p>I looked at some other sites, as well. I was on <a href=\"https://adactio.com/\">Jeremy Keith's website</a> and I also found some things there. I saw that he has thistheme picker where you can change the theme of the site. It reminds me a lot of a <a href=\"http://csszengarden.com/\">CSS zen garden</a>, that's really cool. Since I'm going to have some theming on my site, as well, I might steal that. I like it a lot. So, there’s theming, which I'm going to steal from Jeremy and I also like that on his home page you can see he doesn't have just a list of the latest blog posts but pretty much everything. There’s a photo that he took, there’s an article that he wrote, I guess.<br />\nThere are some teasers to articles that he read and he liked and there’s all kinds of content that he created or that he put online, that's summarized on his home page. I'm going to do it as well because on my current website you can only see the the latest blog posts.</p>\n<p>es, then I visited <a href=\"http://mina.codes/#%F0%9F%92%8B\">Mina Markham's</a> website and I believe<br />\nI didn’t even look at the other pages. I got stuck on the home page because I loved the photo that she put on there. I like it because it has a lot of character and it's not a typical photo that you take… a professional photography that you take where you sit like that and you have a photographer perfect camera that takes a photo of you. It's so dynamic and I really like that. I might even put a photo of me on my website I usually don't like taking photos of myself and putting selfies on Instagram or whatever but I believe it makes sense to put a photo of yourself on your personal website if you want people to know who you are.</p>\n<p>I also visited <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/\">Dave Rupert's site</a>. I like that there’s this illustration, of him I guess, but I also liked his about page where he made this horizontal scrolling column layout – I guess he got inspired by Trello – with all the work he's done in the last eleven, twelve years. That's really cool, I might steal that idea as well for my today I learned page, I don't know, we'll see.</p>\n<p>And the last website that caught my attention recently is the website of my friend <a href=\"https://mxb.dev/blogroll/\">Max Böck</a>. He recently published this blogroll. Usually a blogroll is just a list of names linked to blogs but what he did here is that he added not just a name of the person he links to but also an image and a short paragraph about that person. I like that, I'm going to steal that as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"outro\">[Outro]</h3>\n<p>So, it makes sense to look at other websites, not just because of design reasons but also because you might get some inspiration for how to present content and what kind of content and how to build the basic structure of your website not just design stuff.<br />\nAlright, that's it for today I hope that this helps you just get started with design or to finish a design actually. I just wanted to share my process how I find inspiration how I design stuff.<br />\nIn the next video I'm going to talk about designing in the browser and this is going to be the first video where you will finally see some CSS. In the meantime please give me feedback again, share me links to your websites. I want to steal ideas from you and also please <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj29HII0sgJvKhqPIrO6Skw\">subscribe to the channel</a>, contact me on <a href=\"twitter.com/mmatuzo\">Twitter</a>, if you have questions if you have feedback and thanks so much for watching.

    "partialText": "<p>At the CSS-in-Vienna meet-up last week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/udobiasch\">Ulrich</a> told me that starting with Chrome 79 it's possible to define a string value for the <code>list-style-type</code> property. I was surprised because I thought <code>::marker</code> was supposed to solve that. That's why I did some research, here’s what I learned.</p><h2>list-style-type accepts a string value</h2>\n<p>In Chrome 79+, Firefox 39+, and Opera 66+ it's possible to define a string value as the bullet of an ordered or unordered list, which means that emojis work, as well.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  list-style-type: '🐣';\n}</code></pre>\n<ul class=\"lst-emoji\">\n  <li>Item 1</li>\n  <li>Item 2</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\n.lst-emoji {\n  list-style-type: \"🐣\";\n}\n</style>\n<p>The list item may also be described as an Unicode value.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  list-style-type: '\\1F44D';\n}</code></pre>\n<ul class=\"lst-unicode\">\n  <li>Item 1</li>\n  <li>Item 2</li>\n</ul>\n<style>\n.lst-unicode {\n  list-style-type: \"\\1F44D\";\n}\n</style>\n<h2>@counter-style is a thing</h2>\n<p>Browsing the MDN page for <code>list-style-type</code> I discovered that there’s a <code>@counter-style</code> at-rule. It allows you to define custom counter styles. It's <code>list-style-type</code> with super powers.</p>\n<p>Currently, only supported in Firefox, there are several interesting options, like a list of one or multiple <code>symbols</code>, <code>suffix</code>, <code>prefix</code> or <code>range</code>. I won’t describe them here, I suggest you read about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style\">counter styles on MDN</a> or have a look at the demos below (Firefox only).</p>\n<p><strong>Drooling emoji and a suffix</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@counter-style drooling {\n  system: cyclic;\n  symbols: '\\1F924';\n  suffix: '.

    "partialText": "<p>I’ve been employed for about a year now and many things are different compared to being a freelancer. One interesting thing in my specific situation is that I have to evaluate the accessibility of third-party tools regularly. Usually there’s no time for a full audit, I have to gain a good overview of the quality of a product as quickly as possible.</p><p><em>This article is available in German: <a href=\"/blog/de/testing-with-tab/\">Eines meiner Lieblingswerkzeuge für Barrierefreiheit-Checks: Die Tabulatortaste</a>.</em></p>\n<p>I’ve already shared <a href=\"/blog/beyond-automatic-accessibility-testing-6-things-i-check-on-every-website-i-build/\">6 things I check on every website I build</a>, but this time I want to focus on one of the most powerful testing tools: The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.</p>\n<p>Let’s say, you’ve managed to score 100 on the Lighthouse accessibility audit. <a href=\"/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/\">This doesn’t necessarily mean that your site is accessible</a>, you’ve just laid the groundwork for the actual testing. A next step could be putting your mouse away and using the keyboard only to navigate your site.</p>\n<p>Here’s what pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key will tell you about your website:</p>\n<h2>1. Focus styles</h2>\n<p>If you press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, do you see which item on the page is highlighted?<br />\nNo? Use <code>:focus{ }</code>, <code>:focus-within{ }</code>, or <code>:focus-visible{ }</code> to style elements in their focus state.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n  <span class=\"content__image-wrapper\">\n     <img class=\"content__image\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1582178732/articles/tabkey/tab_a11y_carie.png\" alt=\"A focus linked with a background-color and a dotted outline.\">\n  </span>\n<figcaption>Beautiful focus styles on <a href=\"https://cariefisher.com/\">Carie Fishers website</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">a:focus {\n  background-color: #b426ff;\n  outline: 5px solid #ea3bcb;\n}</code></pre>\n<h3>Learn more about focus styles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/focusing-on-focus-styles/\">Focusing on Focus Styles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus\">:focus on MDN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within\">:focus-within on MDN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible\">focus visible polyfill</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Interactive elements</h2>\n<p>Can you reach interactive elements like links, buttons, form elements, or video controls?<br />\nNo? Work on your HTML. You’re probably using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> only, etc. where you should be using <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Don’t use <code>div</code>s for buttons. This fake button is not accessible to keyboard and screen reader users.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"btn\" onclick=\"send()\"&gt;Send&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Do this instead:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"send()\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Learn more about links and buttons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.htmhell.dev/3-image-buttons/\">#3 image-buttons on HTMHell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XjwDq9zG4I\">The Links vs. Buttons Showdown </a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Real buttons</h2>\n<p>You can reach a button, but nothing happens when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>? It’s probably still not a real <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;input type=\"button\"&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>You can make fake buttons tabbable and you can change their semantics, but you only get key events by default with real buttons.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"btn\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" onclick=\"send()\"&gt;Send&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Do this instead:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button class=\"btn\" onclick=\"send()\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Learn more about buttons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZGqnp06DnI\">Just use button -- A11ycasts #05</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buttoncheatsheet.com/\">The Button Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. Skip links</h2>\n<p>Do you have to tab through a lot of elements before you can reach a certain part of your UI? You probably want to implement skip links.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n  <span class=\"content__image-wrapper\">\n     <img class=\"content__image\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1582178732/articles/tabkey/tab_a11y_tatiana.png\" alt=\"A skip link shows up in the top left corner when focused.\">\n  </span>\n<figcaption>Skip link on <a href=\"https://tatianamac.com/\">Tatiana Mac’s website</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Learn more about skip links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/\">“Skip Navigation” Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Focus management</h2>\n<p>When you press a button and a modal/dialog pops up, can you access its contents immediately? No? You probably have to shift focus from the button to the modal.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function showModal() {\n  ...\n  // Store the last focused element\n  lastFocusedElement = document.activeElement;\n\n  var modal = document.getElementById(modalID);\n  modal.focus();\n  ...\n}\n\n\nfunction closeModal() {\n  ...\n  // Return the focus to the last focused element\n  lastFocusedElement.focus();\n  ...\n}</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-javascript-with-accessibility-in-mind-a1f6a5f467b9#7a0c\">Writing JavaScript with accessibility in mind</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6. Infinite scrolling</h2>\n<p>Do you have a footer but you can’t access it by pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> because you’ve implemented infinite scrolling? Burn it, burn it with fire!</p>\n<p>No, seriously. Infinite scrolling is usually a bad practice.</p>\n<h3>Learn more about infinite scrolling</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.webaxe.org/infinite-scrolling-and-accessibility/\">Infinite Scrolling and Accessibility (It’s Usually Bad)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>7. Off-screen items</h2>\n<p>Does the focus indicator suddenly disappear while you keep tabbing? It’s likely that you’re focusing off-screen items. You have to hide them correctly. <code>height: 0</code>, <code>transform: translateX(-100%)</code>, etc. don’t remove items from tab order, <code>display: none;</code> or <code>visibility:hidden</code> do.</p>\n<div class=\"skip-link-container\">\n<a href=\"#codepen1-skip\" class=\"skip-link skip-link--inline\">Skip CodePen</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-theme-id=\"6054\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"matuzo\" data-slug-hash=\"yxrRGz\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"Inaccessible hiding\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/yxrRGz\">\n  Inaccessible hiding</a> by Manuel Matuzovic (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo\">@matuzo</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"codepen1-skip\">8. DOM order</h2>\n<p>Does the focus indicator skip around a lot? Most of the time it’s because visual order doesn’t match DOM order. Try to avoid reordering logical content and don’t use higher values than <code>0</code> as a value in the<code>tabindex</code> attribute.</p>\n<h3>Learn more about source order</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2015/09/source-order-matters.html\">Source Order Matters</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>9. Custom JS components</h2>\n<p>Are only parts of your JS components accessible with the keyboard? Read the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/\">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices</a> to learn how to build common patterns correctly and make them accessible to everyone.</p>\n<h2>The Tab key is awesome</h2>\n<p>You don't need to learn a software to get started with accessibility testing, the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key will tell you a lot about the quality of your website. There’s more you have to check, but testing with the keyboard brings you one step closer to creating an inclusive website.</p>\n<p>This post is based on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo/status/1090932098456801281\">twitter thread from last year</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9COne+of+my+favourite+accessibility+testing+tools%3A+The+Tab+Key.%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

Verwende <code>:focus{ }</code>, <code>:focus-within{ }</code> oder <code>:focus-visible{ }</code>, um Elemente in ihrem Fokuszustand zu stylen.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n  <span class=\"content__image-wrapper\">\n     <img class=\"content__image\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1582178732/articles/tabkey/tab_a11y_carie.png\" alt=\"Ein fokussierter Link mit einer Hintergrundfarbe und einem gepunkteten Outline.\">\n  </span>\n<figcaption>Schöne und deutlich sichtbare Fokus-Styles auf <a href=\"https://cariefisher.com/\">Carie Fishers Website</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">a:focus {\n  background-color: #b426ff;\n  outline: 5px solid #ea3bcb;\n}</code></pre>\n<h3>Erfahre mehr über Fokus-Styles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/focusing-on-focus-styles/\">Focusing on Focus Styles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus\">:focus on MDN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within\">:focus-within on MDN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible\">focus visible polyfill</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Interaktive Elemente</h2>\n<p>Kannst du interaktive Elemente wie Links, Buttons, Formularelemente oder Video-Steuerelemente erreichen?<br />\nNein? Verbessere dein HTML. Du verwendest vermutlich nur <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>,  usw., wo du <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> oder <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> verwenden solltest.</p>\n<p>Benutze keine <code>div</code>s für Buttons.

Echte Buttons</h2>\n<p>Du kannst einen Button erreichen, aber es passiert nichts, wenn du <kbd>Enter</kbd> oder <kbd>Space</kbd> drückst? Es handelt sich vermutlich immer noch nicht um einen echten <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> oder <code>&lt;input type=\"button\"&gt;</code>.

    "partialText": "<p>The question how good <em>good enough</em> is and at which point a website is ready to go online is keeping me busy lately. The web is in bad shape and it’s because we’re making it too easy on ourselves. <em>“It’s online and works in most browsers”</em> is not enough - we have to be much more considerate of what we’re putting online.</p><p>Some background: About three years ago I specialized in web accessibility. Now it’s not just my job to make sure that the websites I build are accessible, but the websites of others, too. I’m a front-end developer, but also a consultant and auditor. I’m employed for about a year now as well, and I have to evaluate a lot more third party web products than I used to.</p>\n<h2>Something has changed</h2>\n<p>A friend recently sent me the link to a website and asked me for feedback, because I had experience with the content management system their client was using.<br />\nI <a href=\"/blog/beyond-automatic-accessibility-testing-6-things-i-check-on-every-website-i-build/\">checked a few things</a> and then browsed through the website with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools\">Dev Tools</a> and the network panel open. The homepage had a page weight of <strong>4.1 MB (6.7 MB uncompressed)</strong>. I thought, “<em>Aight, that’s not great, but there are a bunch of images, so I guess it’s okay</em>”. Then I visited a page with a header, footer, sidebar navigation and a short paragraph <strong>(543 KB / 1.6 MB uncompressed)</strong> and I thought “<em>Nice, noticeably below 1 MB, that’s pretty good.</em>”.</p>\n<p>And then it hit me.<br />\nWhat the hell did just happen? <strong>543 KB</strong> on a simple text-only page is OK? Fuck no, it’s not.</p>\n<p>How and when did I get to the point where I would consider a page weight of 4 MB on a large page and 500 KB on a small page normal? This got me thinking (and writing obviously). This is not an exception. The quality of most websites I audit and evaluate is bad. Somehow we've collectively decided that it’s okay to publish garbage.<br />\nWhen I say we, I don’t just mean us developers. The reason could be a developer who doesn’t care enough, but it could also be a team lead, product owner or client who simply doesn’t give devs enough time to care about quality. Causes for that could be a lack of awareness, tough deadlines, short release cycles, or focus on development of new features instead of improvement of existing code.<br />\nWhen I say garbage, I mean slow, inaccessible, annoying, stressful, or intrusive web experiences.</p>\n<h3>Slow</h3>\n<p>I need 1.6 MB of JavaScript (7.2 MB uncompressed) to display a table with my billing history.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure figure--full\">\n  <a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1582717566/articles/543kb/adobe_j.jpg\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_1300/v1582717566/articles/543kb/adobe_j.jpg\" alt=\"Logged in on adobe.com.

That’s not bad, even on a 3G connection that site should load in a reasonable time.</em>”.</p>\n<h2>Why 543 KB might be bad</h2>\n<p>Yes, I know, it depends. 543 KB aren't always bad, but on that specific page there’s only a single image (the logo ~20 KB) and a single paragraph. So why then is the page still relatively large, where are the remaining 523 KB coming from?</p>\n<p>Let’s break it up and see what we could take into account when we evaluate the total transferred bytes.</p>\n<h3>Page weight</h3>\n<p>Even in times of 4G or 5G, optimizing for fast download is important. People don’t always surf the web under the best conditions. Build your website for someone who visits it at Starbucks using Starbucks WIFI and not for someone who’s connected to their own fast internet at home.</p>\n<p>The website we’re talking about now is an Austrian website, in German language, accessed mostly by Austrians via Austrian networks. We’re a country with affordable and fast data. Don’t get me wrong, the page weight is definitely too big, but I’d argue that it's not the biggest issue, especially if they’re caching efficiently and prioritizing asset loading correctly (spoiler alert: they’re not… ).</p>\n<h3>DOM size</h3>\n<p>Many and deeply nested elements result in a large DOM tree, which can affect runtime, memory and load performance negatively.</p>\n<p>A large DOM tree in combination with complicated styles might have a bad effect on page rendering. In his talk <em>“</em><a href=\"https://www.technica11y.org/performance-and-the-accessibility-tree\"><em>The Intersection of Performance and Accessibility</em></a><em>”</em> <a href=\"https://ericwbailey.design/\">Eric W. Bailey</a> gives an example of a form based on Material Design that caused the screen reader Voice Over to crash because of its massive DOM size.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To make a material design radio input, you need six HTML elements containing nine attributes with a DOM depth of three. You also need 66 CSS selectors containing 141 properties which weighs in at 10k when minified. You also need 2374 lines of JavaScript which weighs in at 30k when minified. All of this will get you a radio input.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another factor is JavaScript. Updating complex DOM structures can get expensive, changes at one level in the DOM tree can cause changes at every level of the tree, which leads to more time being spent <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a\">performing reflow</a>. DOM operations can become a performance bottleneck, but there’s more to consider, like storing references to a large number of nodes, which might overwhelm the memory capabilities of devices. Creating DOM nodes only when needed and destroying them when no longer needed helps with that.</p>\n<p>If you don’t write your markup carefully and enable compression on the server, your HTML document might end up having multiple hundred kilobytes, although it should be somewhere in the lower tens.<br />\nBy writing carefully I mean only creating DOM nodes you need and adding extra divs and spans only when necessary. In React, <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html\">Fragments</a> might help with that.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">class Columns extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;React.Fragment&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>A fragment just returns the content within the fragment without an extra wrapper <code>div</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/dom-size\">Google recommends</a> less than 1500 nodes total, a maximum depth of 32 nodes, and no parent node with more than 60 child nodes.</p>\n<h3>CSS</h3>\n<p>There are 11 style sheets with a total weight of 97 KB (566 KB uncompressed). Only by looking at the numbers it’s hard to tell if there are a lot of unused rules in there, but 566 KB of minified CSS is definitely not something that can be ignored. I'm not saying that refactoring their CSS is a must, but I’d at least consider taking another look at what goes into the CSS bundle. Sometimes it’s not even our fault that bundle sizes are too big. Many content management systems or plug-ins come with huge JS and CSS files where only a fraction of the code is needed.</p>\n<p>Another thing worth considering is splitting up the main CSS file by media feature, especially if the assets are served via HTTP2.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;!-- Downloaded and render blocking --&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"main.css\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Downloaded but not render blocking if media query doesn’t match --&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"medium.css\" media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"large.css\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"print.css\" media=\"print\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Before HTTP2 this was kinda considered a bad practice, but with HTTP2 multiplexing, the number of requests that can be sent to the server at the same time is no longer limited. The big advantage of splitting CSS into multiple files is that browsers will download all of them, but only those needed to fulfill the current context will block rendering,</p>\n<p>Read more about the topic in Harry Roberts fantastic article <a href=\"https://csswizardry.com/2018/11/css-and-network-performance/\">CSS and Network Performance</a>.</p>\n<h3>Fonts</h3>\n<p>Font files can get pretty big, a <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/\">good font loading strategy</a> is essential. Fonts are sometimes a necessary evil, but one file is a 34 KB Font Awesome file. SVGs might be a better choice, because they're more flexible than icon fonts for animation and styling, and a SVG sprite with just the icons needed and not the whole set of icons might end up being much smaller.</p>\n<p>It’s been years since I’ve used services like Font Awesome, SVGs have so much <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/\">more advantages over icons fonts</a>.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript and bundle sizes</h3>\n<p>There are 22 JS files with a total file size of 320 KB (886 KB uncompressed). This is way too much considering that there’s only a navigation and a share button on this page.</p>\n<p>I will not bash JavaScript, I love JS and I enjoy writing it. I’m not great at it though, and I’d argue that most of us aren’t. Lack of knowledge paired with a language that can easily fuck up performance is dangerous. That’s why I’m very cautious of what I’m doing and which 3rd party plugins I’m using.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure figure--full\">\n  <a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1582780558/articles/543kb/addy.jpg\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_1300/v1582780558/articles/543kb/addy.jpg\" alt=\"Addy Osmani on the left on stage at #PerfMatters conf. A slide on the right “Stop taking fast networks, CPU & high RAM for granted”.\">\n  </a>\n</figure>\n<p>I’ve watched Addy Osmani’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9eRLElSW1c&amp;feature=emb_title\">The Cost of JavaScript</a> the other day, which is also one reason I’m writing this article. I was blown away by so many things he said. Here’s a summary of my highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>JavaScript is one of the most expensive parts of your site, reduce how much JS you ship.</li>\n<li>Small JavaScript bundles improve download speeds, lower memory usage, and reduce CPU costs.</li>\n<li>Avoid large bundles <strong>(50KB+)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Post-Download, executing JavaScript is the dominant cost.</li>\n<li>The differences between a low-end phone and high-end phone are huge.</li>\n<li>Fast JavaScript means fast at download, parse and compile, and execute.</li>\n<li>Avoid large inline scripts.</li>\n<li>If possible, split your JS code.</li>\n<li>Audit JS regularly.</li>\n<li>Make performance part of the conversation.</li>\n<li>Stop taking fast networks, fast CPU, and high RAM for granted.</li>\n<li>Test on real phones and networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch the talk or <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019\">read the article</a>, I promise you’ll love it.</p>\n<p>If you know more about performance than I do (and you probably do), you might be shouting at the screen <em>“You didn’t consider this and that”</em>. Fair enough, but this post is not about how to optimize those 543 KB. It was my attempt to show you that we can’t expect whatever we produce and put online to be fine. We have to be much more considerate, we have to take a second and third look, and constantly challenge our decisions. Sometimes, even just slowing down can make a difference. As <a href=\"https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/keeping-it-simple-with-css-that-scales/\">Andy Bell recently discovered</a> while reviewing a larger codebase, stepping back and ignoring time pressure for a moment can help with seeing things clearly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We had two or three grid systems, some fluid type and some utility driven type that conflicted <strong>and</strong> a card component that was pretty much a website in itself. If I had slowed down and stepped back, I could have seen these problems, but I didn’t. So seriously, slow down and you will save so much time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://hankchizljaw.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Andy Bell</a></p>\n<p>By the way, the 543 KB page scored 11 points on the Lighthouse performance test.</p>\n<h2>Why bother?</h2>\n<p>Why is a website I'll probably never visit again bothering me so much?<br />\nBecause someone decided that it was good enough to go live. The problem is not this specific website or how fast it loads, but that <strong>shipping seems to be so much more important than performance, usability, accessibility, or user experience</strong>. Again, I know it’s not always up to us, because often we just have to publish something we don’t agree with, but the least we can do is to educate others why some decisions might be harmful, and try to improve things in whatever ways we can.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s becoming increasingly clear that web performance isn’t solely an engineering problem, but a problem of people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/innovation-cant-keep-the-web-fast/\">Jeremy Wagner</a></p>\n<h2>Whats good enough?</h2>\n<p>I started this article with the question “how good is <em>good enough</em>”. I can’t answer it for all of us, because it depends on our personal experience and capabilities. What I consider good enough might not live up to the expectations of others, but there are standards and best practices we can follow.</p>\n<p>Here are a few things I (as a front-end dev) believe have to happen before a website can go online.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/\">Validate your HTML.</a></li>\n<li>Test in many browsers. There’s a world beyond Firefox and Chrome. Check Opera, Firefox Mobile, Brave, Edge, or Samsung Internet, just to name a few.

I want to change that, and I invite you to do the same.</p><p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools\">Firefox Developer Tools</a> have improved so much in the last few years that I naturally switched from Chrome as my main development browser to Firefox. This helped me understand their differences, not just when working (developer experience) but also when surfing (user experience). <br />\nRecently we’ve finished building a new feature, and I wanted to test it on my phone. I went through my apps to see which browsers I have installed. I needed quite some time to find them all because <s>I’m not well organised</s> I use them only for testing and then I forget about them.</p>\n<h2>How many browsers do you know by heart?</h2>\n<p>Okay, try to list as many browsers as possible. I’ll give you a few seconds.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Here’s my list: Chrome, Chrome for Android, Firefox, Firefox Mobile, Opera, Opera Mobile, Opera Mini, Vivaldi, IE, Edge, Brave, UC, Firefox Focus, Safari, Samsung Internet, Firefox DE, Safari iOS.</p>\n<p>Did you know that there’s a <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android\">DuckDuckGo Browser</a>, a browser called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.globalbrowser.mini&amp;hl=de_AT\">Mint</a> with over 5 Million downloads in the Android Play Store or a browser called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.mgeek.TunnyBrowser&amp;hl=de_AT\">Dolphin</a> with over 50 Million downloads?</p>\n<p>I didn’t. There are even more browser with millions of downloads.</p>\n<h2>Let’s switch browsers</h2>\n<p>I know how Firefox, Chrome and Safari differ, but I don’t know too much about other browsers and I want to change that. I will switch browsers every two weeks to learn more about them and I invite you to do the same.</p>\n<p>So, for the next two weeks I’ll use <a href=\"https://vivaldi.com/\">Vivaldi</a> on my laptop and <a href=\"https://brave.com/\">Brave</a> on my smartphone and I will share my experience before I switch again.<br />\nIf you join me, I'd love to hear about your experience via <a href=\"manuel@matuzo.at\">email</a>.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CHow+many+browsers+do+you+know%3F%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

That’s probably why I’ve never noticed that the default value of <code>border-color</code> is <code>currentColor</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.parent {\n  color: #ca3041;\n  border-style: solid;\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"parent\"&gt;yo!&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<style>\n.div-color {\n  color: #ca3041;\n}\n</style>\n<div class=\"div-color\" style=\"border-style: solid;\">yo!</div>\n<p>So, if you change the <code>color</code> value of an element, its border color changes, too.<br><br />\nThat’s the case for most properties that have a color.</p>\n<h3>text-emphasis-color</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.parent em {\n  text-emphasis-style: '*';\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"div-color\"><em style=\"text-emphasis-style: '*'\"><abbr title=\"What the fuck\">WTF</abbr> is text-emphasis?</em></div>\n<h3>text-shadow</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.parent span {\n  text-shadow: 5px 10px;\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"div-color\"><span style=\"text-shadow: 5px 10px;\">yo!</span></div>\n<h3>text-decoration-color</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.parent span {\n  text-decoration: overline underline;\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"div-color\"><span style=\"text-decoration: overline underline\">yo!</span></div>\n<h3>caret-color</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The user agent selects an appropriate color for the caret.

Now I am. :)</p>\n<h2>HSL colors</h2>\n<p>Yes, I know, HSL colors are not specific to the color property and they’ve been around for forever (IE 9+), but I’ve never used them and I don’t know how they work. Now is a good time to find out.</p>\n<p>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) is an alternative representation of the RGB color model.</p>\n<h3>Hue</h3>\n<p>H is an angle of the color circle. It can be defined using 4 different units.</p>\n<p><code>deg</code> (or unitless): a value between 0 and 360. Red: 0deg, Green: 120deg, Blue: 240deg.<br />\n<code>rad</code>: a value between 0 and 2π (~6.2832). (Red: 0rad, Green: 2.0944rad, Blue: 4.1888rad)<br />\n<code>grad</code>: a value between 0 and 400. (Re: 0grad, Green: 133.33grad, Blue: 266.66grad)<br />\n<code>turn</code>: a value between 0 and 1. (Re: 0grad, Green: 0.333turn, Blue: 0.6666turn)</p>\n<p>For example, a right angle is 90deg = 100grad = 0.25turn ≈ 1.5708rad</p>\n<p>This page about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/angle\">the &lt;angle&gt; CSS data type</a> on MDN helped me better understand how these units relate.</p>\n<h3>Saturation</h3>\n<p>S is a percentage. 0% is fully unsaturated (gray), 100% is fully saturated.</p>\n<h3>Lightness</h3>\n<p>L is a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 50% lightness is default, and 100% lightness is white.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  background: hsl(0, 100%, 100%); /* = #FFFFFF */\n}</code></pre>\n<p style=\"background: hsl(0, 100%, 100%); color: hsl(0, 100%, 0%)\">hsl(0, 100%, 100%)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  background: hsl(0, 100%, 0%); /* = #000000 */\n}</code></pre>\n<p style=\"background: hsl(0, 100%, 0%); color: hsl(0, 100%, 100%)\">hsl(0, 100%, 0%)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  background: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); /* = #FF0000 */\n}</code></pre>\n<p style=\"background: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); color: hsl(0, 100%, 100%)\">hsl(0, 100%, 50%)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  background: hsl(0, 50%, 50%); /* = ##bf4040 */\n}</code></pre>\n<p style=\"background: hsl(0, 50%, 50%); color: hsl(0, 100%, 100%)\">hsl(0, 50%, 50%)</p>\n<p>There’s also hsla, which adds support for a fourth parameter (alpha).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  background: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5); /* = rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)*/\n}</code></pre>\n<p style=\"background: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5); color: hsl(0, 100%, 0%)\">hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5)</p>\n<p>CSS Colors Level 4 adds support for space-separated values.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  background: hsl(0 100% 50% / .15); /* = rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.15*/\n  background: hsl(0 100% 50% / 15%) /* = rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.15*/\n}</code></pre>\n<p style=\"background: hsl(0 100% 50% / 15%); color: hsl(0, 100%, 0%)\">hsl(0 100% 50% / 15%)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many designers find HSL more intuitive than RGB, since it allows hue, saturation, and lightness to each be adjusted independently. HSL can also make it easier to create a set of matching colors (such as when you want multiple shades of a single hue).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#HSL_colors\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#HSL_colors</a></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading ❤️.

    "partialText": "<p>Nokia released an updated version of its iconic <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/nokia-3310\">Nokia 3310</a> about 3 years ago. It was affordable for me (€60/$65), so I had to get one. It came with a 2 MP camera, a battery that lasts 30 days (up to 22 hours talk time), 2G, 16 MB storage, the original Snake game, and a browser.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,q_90,w_800/v1588058813/articles/progressive/nokia_phones.jpg\" alt=\"4 Nokia 3310 phones in blue, read, gray, and yellow\" /></p>\n<p>Screenshot: <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/nokia-3310\">Nokia</a>.</p>\n<h2>Opera Mini</h2>\n<p>You can access the worldwide web on the Nokia 3310 with <a href=\"https://www.opera.com/de/mobile\">Opera Mini</a>. There are different versions of the Opera Mini browser, how it renders pages depends on the operating system, device, and settings you’re using.<br />\nIf you install it on your smartphone, you probably won’t see any differences, because it uses the underlying browser engine on your Android or iOS phone. An interesting bit about this browser, though, is that you can set different data savings options (off, automatic, high, or extreme). When browsing in extreme mode requests are sent to one of Operas proxy servers which retrieves the web page, processes and compresses it, and sends it back. Opera claims that this reduces the amount of data transmitted up to 90%. This limits interactivity because JavaScript is processed only by the proxy server, and the device just renders it.</p>\n<p>Some other notable things about JavaScript in Opera Mini:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All scripts are allowed a <strong>maximum of two seconds to execute</strong>.</li>\n<li>setInterval and <strong>setTimeout functions are disabled</strong>.</li>\n<li>The number of <strong>events allowed to trigger scripts is limited</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Opera Mini has a strong focus on performance and data saving. I guess that’s also one reason why it’s installed on my Nokia phone. Now, the browser installed on my 3310 is different to the Opera Mini version on my smartphone. It’s the one that’s usually presented in a beautiful red color on <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">caniuse.com</a>, if you search for almost any feature.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure figure--full\">\n<a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms3d\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,q_100,w_1290/v1588059649/articles/progressive/caniuse.jpg\" alt=\"Most browsers support 2D transforms in CSS.

Progressive Enhancement focuses on content and enhances experiences layer by layer. <a href=\"https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/\">Aaron Gustafson</a> explains how we can apply Progressive Enhancement to web development in his iconic article <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement/\">“Understanding Progressive Enhancement“</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,q_100,w_540/v1588060675/articles/progressive/m-m.jpg\" alt=\"A peanut M&amp;M whith each layer labelled.

Coat that content with a layer of rich, creamy CSS. Finally, add JavaScript as the hard candy shell to make a wonderfully tasty treat (and keep it from melting in your hands).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><cite>Aaron Gustafson</cite>.</p>\n<h2>How I’m applying Progressive Enhancement</h2>\n<p>I have some practical examples for you to help you better understand what Progressive Enhancement on the web means.</p>\n<h3>Grid</h3>\n<p>For the 2-column layout on the homepage of <a href=\"https://www.frontendbookmarks.com/\">Front-end Bookmarks</a>, I’m using CSS Grid. If a browser doesn’t understand <code>display: grid</code> it just falls back to a single column layout. Note that I don’t have to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Conditional_Rules/Using_Feature_Queries\">feature queries</a> because browsers just ignore properties they don’t understand.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(29rem,1fr));\n  grid-gap: .7rem;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1588061714/articles/progressive/ie11ff.jpg\" alt=\"single column vs. 2 column layout comparison\" /></p>\n<p>The single column layout isn’t ideal, but it's good enough.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>Modern browsers render a combo-box in the page's header that lets you browse, filter and select pages. In my JavaScript I want to use arrow functions, template literals, etc. without having to polyfill these features for less capable browsers. That’s why I’m sending JavaScript only to browsers that understand ES2015+. I do that by adding <code>type=\"module\"</code> to my script tags.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">&lt;script src=\"/assets/js/scripts.min.js\" type=\"module\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Browsers will only execute the script if they support JavaScript modules, and browsers that support modules also support ES2015+ features. Philip Walton introduced this technique in 2017 in his article <a href=\"https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/\">Deploying ES2015+ Code in Production Today</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/v1588062035/articles/progressive/ie11ff2.jpg\" alt=\"simple search form on the left in IE, combobox on the right in Firefox\" /></p>\n<p>This rich JavaScript component falls back to a simple search form. The input field is pre-populated with the value <i>“site:www.frontendbookmarks.com ”</i>. If you add a search term to this string and hit the submit button, the search engine <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com\">DuckDuckGo</a> will open and <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3A+frontendbookmarks.com+html&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web\">search for the entered keyword on frontendbookmarks.com</a>.<br />\nIt’s not the best experience, but better than no experience.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;form action=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\" method=\"GET\"&gt;\n  &lt;label for=\"search\"&gt;Search on DuckDuckGo&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input\n    id=\"search\"\n    name=\"q\"\n    value=\"site:www.frontendbookmarks.com \"\n    type=\"text\"\n  /&gt;\n   &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>I stole that idea from <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/\">Zach</a> who uses a similar solution for search in the <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/docs/search/\">eleventy docs</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m planning on improving the performance on Front-end Bookmarks by using the webp image format and lazy loading. I haven’t implemented it yet, but for both features I will also make use of Progressive Enhancement.</p>\n<h3>Webp Images</h3>\n<p>The advantage of webp is the file size, which usually is much smaller compared to other image formats. Unfortunately, I can’t just replace all my jpgs with webps, because <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp\">Safari and IE don't support WebP</a>, but we can give browsers options by using the <code>picture</code> element.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;picture&gt;\n  &lt;source srcset=\"image.webp\" type=\"image/webp\" /&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"image description\" /&gt;\n&lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Browsers read the <code>picture</code> element from top to bottom. If they support WebP, they will use the webp image defined in the <code>source</code> element. If not, they just skip it and use the jpg defined in the <code>img</code> tag instead.</p>\n<h3>Lazy loading</h3>\n<p>To optimize image loading performance, I’ll use lazy-loading which makes sure that images are only downloaded if they’re visible in (or close to) the viewport. I really don’t want to use a large third party script for that, instead I’ll go for native lazy loading with a fallback for browsers that don’t support it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;img data-src=\"myimage.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Replace the src attribute with the value in the data-src attribute\n// for browsers that support native lazy-loading.\nif ('loading' in HTMLImageElement.prototype) {\n  const images = document.querySelectorAll(\"img[loading='lazy']\");\n  images.forEach((img) =&gt; {\n    img.src = img.dataset.src;\n  });\n} else {\n  // Fallback for other browsers\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Rahul Nanwani explains in his article <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-complete-guide-to-lazy-loading-images/\">The Complete Guide to Lazy Loading Images</a> how a fallback for native lazy-loading might look like.</p>\n<p>Update June 10, 2020.</p>\n<p>This pattern uses Javascript to add the <code>src</code> attribute to the image. If JavaScript is not active in the browser, the image won’t show. We can work around that by progressively enhancing the pattern once more.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;img data-src=\"myimage.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" /&gt;\n&lt;noscript&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"myimage_lowres.jpg\" /&gt;\n&lt;/noscript&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Content wrapped in <code>noscript</code> tags will only execute, if scripting is currently turned off in the browser. For that scenario, we can provide a low-resolution version of the image which is much smaller in file size.</p>\n<h2>Progressive Enhancement is beautiful</h2>\n<p>I’ve titled this post <em>The beauty of progressive enhancement</em> because it’s beautiful to see which shape an experience can take on different devices, operating systems, and browsers. Progressive Enhancement allows us to use the latest and greatest features HTML, CSS and JavaScript offer us, by providing a basic, but robust foundation for all.<br />\nEnabling people who use browsers like Internet Explorer 11 or Opera Mini to access content is essential. Don’t rely on browser statistics, think about who you’re building websites for. Our users are diverse, just like their physical abilities, personal preferences, and the devices and browsers they’re using.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading. ❤️<br />\nIf you have more examples for progressive enhacement, please share them with me via <a href=\"mailto: manuel@matuzo.at\">e-mail</a>.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Mini\">Opera Mini on wikipedia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/using-webp-images/\">Using WebP Images</a> by Jeremy Wagner</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://addyosmani.com/blog/lazy-loading/\">Native image lazy-loading for the web!</a> by Addy Osmani</li>\n</ul><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CThe+beauty+of+progressive+enhancement%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>This is part 3 of my series <a href=\"/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know/\">Here’s what I didn’t know about…</a> in which I try to learn new things about CSS. This time I'm trying to find out what I didn’t know about the <code>content</code> property.</p><p>A few weeks ago Stefan published a post on his website called “<a href=\"https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/css-content-accepts-alternative-text/\">The CSS \"content\" property accepts alternative text</a>”, which blew my mind. He showed that the <code>content</code> property excepts 2 values and not just 1, the actual content and an alternative text.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.new-item::before {\n  /* \"Highlighted item\" and element content is read out */\n  content: '★' / 'Highlighted item';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>I didn’t know that and I was wondering if there were more things I didn’t know about the <code>content</code> property. Since you’re reading this, I found something, so let’s see what I was able to add to my <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know/\">“Here’s what I didn’t know about…”</a> series.</p>\n<h2>How I’m using the content attribute.</h2>\n<p>Before I started my research, I was using this property primarily for 3 things.</p>\n<h3>Adding an element to another element using pseudo elements</h3>\n<p>If I want to create a simple shape in CSS that is not a rectangle or circle, I use <code>:after</code> and <code>::before</code> to give myself more options for styling.</p>\n<style>\n  .contentdemo1 {\n    width: 70px;\n    height: 50px;\n    margin-top: 15px;\n    border: 5px solid #123456;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  .contentdemo1::before {\n    content: \"\";\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    top: -16px;\n    width: 20px;\n    height: 20px;\n    margin: auto;\n    border: solid #123456;\n    border-width: 5px 5px 0 0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    transform: rotate(-45deg);\n    background: #fafafa;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"contentdemo1\"></div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  width: 70px;\n  height: 50px;\n  margin-top: 15px;\n\n  border: 5px solid #123456;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n\n  position: relative;\n}\n\ndiv::before {\n  content: '';\n\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  top: -16px;\n\n  width: 20px;\n  height: 20px;\n  margin: auto;\n\n  border: solid #123456;\n  border-width: 5px 5px 0 0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n\n  transform: rotate(-45deg);\n  background: #fff;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/eYpLKdz\">example 1 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p>To render on screen, the pseudo elements needs the <code>content</code> attribute.</p>\n<h3>Revealing URLs in print styles sheets</h3>\n<p>Printed links are useless if you don’t know where there are leading. I’m using a combination of <code>content</code> and the <code>attr()</code> function in print style sheets to display URLs next to their linked text.</p>\n<style>\n    .contentdemo2[href^=\"http://\"]:after,\n    .contentdemo2[href^=\"https://\"]:after {\n      content: \" (\" attr(href) \")\";\n    }\n</style>\n<p><a href=\"https://mxb.dev/\" class=\"contentdemo2\">Max Böck</a></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@media print {\n  a[href^=\"http://\"]:after,\n  a[href^=\"https://\"]:after\n  {\n    content: ' (' attr(href) ')';\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<h3>Custom counters</h3>\n<p>Every now and then I need custom counters in lists. A combination of <code>content</code> and counter properties usually does the job.</p>\n<style>\n    .contentdemo3 {\n    list-style-type: none;\n    counter-reset: mylist;\n  }\n  .contentdemo3 > li {\n    counter-increment: mylist;\n  }\n  .contentdemo3 > li::before {\n    content: \"🤤 \" counter(mylist) \": \"\n  }\n</style>\n<ol class=\"contentdemo3\">\n  <li>Element 001</li>\n  <li>Element 002</li>\n  <li>Element 003</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Element 001&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Element 002&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Element 003&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ol {\n  list-style-type: none;\n  counter-reset: mylist;\n}\n\nli {\n  counter-increment: mylist;\n}\n\nli::before {\n  content: '🤤 ' counter(mylist) ': ';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/eYpLKGg\">example 2 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p>Have a look at <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know-about-list-style-type/\">Here’s what I didn’t know about list-style-type</a> for more options to style list items.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s see what else <code>content</code> can do for us. Here’s what I’ve learned recently:</p>\n<h2>Content accepts images and gradients</h2>\n<p>I knew that <code>content</code> accepts the <code>counter</code> and <code>attr</code> functions, but it never came to my mind that it might allow other functions, as well. Whenever I needed an image in a pseudo element, I would use <code>background-image</code>, although <code>content</code> would've worked, too.</p>\n<style>\n.contentdemo7::before {\n  content: url('/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know-about-content/pin.png');\n}\n</style>\n<div class=\"contentdemo7\"></div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div::before {\n  content: url('pin.png');\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/yLYZgqO?editors=1100\">example 3 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p>If this works with images, it should work with gradients too, right? Yeah, well, no. Chrome seems to be the only browser that renders pseudo elements with gradient content values.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div::before {\n  content: linear-gradient(blue, red);\n  height: 50px;\n  width: 50px;\n  display: block;\n  border: 1px solid red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/WNQPRPv?editors=1100\">example 4 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<h2>You can define alt text for content values (…in Chrome)</h2>\n<p>What’s the point of using <code>content</code> when <code>background-image</code> has better support? The reason Stefan wrote his post, <code>content</code> supports alt text.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div::before {\n  content: url('pin.png') / 'You are here.';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/ZEbweNj?editors=1100\">example 5 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this only works in Chrome (tested on macOS 10.15.4, Chrome 81 with VoiceOver). Firefox and Safari don't even render the pseudo element because the value is invalid. Too bad.</p>\n<p>Even if this worked in most browsers, I wouldn’t recommend adding text content to a CSS file. Others working on the project probably wouldn’t expect text coming from a CSS file, things might get messy on sites with multiple languages, auto-translation may not work, and the content is only accessible if the CSS loads successfully.<br />\nAdrian Roselli shares an example of a poor practice in <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/link-targets-and-3-2-5.html#CSS\">Link Targets and 3.2.5</a>.</p>\n<h2>You can combine text and images</h2>\n<p>Nor did I know that you can use the <code>url()</code> function as a value, I also didn’t know that you can combine it with text.</p>\n<style>\n    .contentdemo4::before {\n  content: url('/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know-about-content/pin.png') \"You are here.\"\n}\n</style>\n<div class=\"contentdemo4\"></div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div::before {\n  content: url('pin.png') 'You are here.';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/xxwMLgJ?editors=1100\">example 6 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<h2>You can only replace the content of a regular element with an &lt;image&gt;</h2>\n<p>The <code>content</code> property is meant to be used with pseudo elements. You can’t use it to replace a string in an element with another string. This won’t work:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  content: 'You are here';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>But you can use it to replace a string with an image. The string is still in the <abbr title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr> but screen readers announce the filename. (You can do it, but you shouldn’t.)</p>\n<style>\n    .contentdemo5 {\n  content: url('/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know-about-content/pin.png');\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"contentdemo5\">You are here!</div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div&gt;You are here!&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  content: url('pin.png');\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/pojGrPw?editors=1100\">example 7 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<h2>There are quotes and no-quotes</h2>\n<p>Okay, now this one is really cool. Let’s say we have a quote nested in another quote.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  My mama always said,\n  &lt;q&gt;\n    Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get &lt;/q\n  &gt;.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>\n<style>\n  .contentdemoquote {\n    margin-bottom: 3rem !important;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  .contentdemoquote::before {\n    display: none;\n    transform: none !important;\n    border: none !important;\n    width: auto !important;\n    height: auto !important;\n    position: static !important;\n  }\n</style>\n<blockquote class=\"contentdemoquote\">\n  My mama always said,  \n  <q>\n    Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.\n  </q>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What you should see in the above example is that the <code>blockquote</code> has no quotes and <code>q</code> has double quotes.</p>\n<p>If we add opening and closing quotes to the <code>blockquote</code> using pseudo elements and the <code>content</code> property, the <code>blockquote</code> now displays double quotes and the <code>q</code> automatically single quotes.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">blockquote::before {\n  content: open-quote;\n}\n\nblockquote::after {\n  content: close-quote;\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  .contentdemoquote2::before {\n    content: open-quote  !important;\n    display: inline;\n  }\n  .contentdemoquote2::after {\n    content: close-quote;\n  }\n  .contentdemoquote2[lang=\"fr\"]::before {\n    content: open-quote \"\\00a0\"  !important;\n    display: inline;\n  }\n  .contentdemoquote2[lang=\"fr\"]::after {\n    content: \"\\00a0\" close-quote;\n  }\n</style>\n<blockquote class=\"contentdemoquote contentdemoquote2\">\n  My mama always said,  \n  <q>\n    Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.\n  </q>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nice! To top it all off, we can even have a combination of the two variations, <code>blockquote</code> with no quotes and <code>q</code> with single quotes.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">blockquote::before {\n  content: no-open-quote;\n}\n\nblockquote::after {\n  content: no-close-quote;\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  .contentdemoquote3::before {\n    content: no-open-quote !important;\n    display: inline;\n  }\n  .contentdemoquote3::after {\n    content: no-close-quote;\n  }\n</style>\n<blockquote class=\"contentdemoquote contentdemoquote3\">\n  My mama always said,  \n  <q>\n    Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.\n  </q>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>no-open-quote</code> and <code>no-close-quote</code> keywords don’t insert anything, but increment the quotation depth by one.</p>\n<h3>Nested quotes in different languages</h3>\n<p>Just because I was curious, here are some variations of the second example in other languages.</p>\n<h4>French</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;blockquote lang=\"fr\"&gt;\n  Maman disait toujours,\n  &lt;q&gt;\n    la vie, c'est comme une boîte de chocolats: on ne sait jamais sur quoi on va\n    tomber &lt;/q\n  &gt;.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>\n<blockquote lang=\"fr\" class=\"contentdemoquote contentdemoquote2\">\n   Maman disait toujours,  \n  <q>  \n   la vie, c'est comme une boîte de chocolats: on ne sait jamais sur quoi on va tomber  \n  </q>.\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Russian</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;blockquote lang=\"ru\"&gt;\n  Моя мама всегда говорила,\n  &lt;q&gt;\n    Жизнь как коробка шоколадных конфет: никогда не знаешь, какая начинка тебе\n    попадётся &lt;/q\n  &gt;.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code></pre>\n<blockquote lang=\"ru\" class=\"contentdemoquote contentdemoquote2\">\n  Моя мама всегда говорила,  \n  <q>  \n    Жизнь как коробка шоколадных конфет: никогда не знаешь, какая начинка тебе попадётся  \n  </q>.\n</blockquote>\n<h4>German</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;blockquote lang=\"de\"&gt;\n  Mama hat immer gesagt,\n  &lt;q&gt;\n    Das Leben ist wie eine Schachtel Pralinen.

A</p>\n<p>Let’s check out our options.</p>\n<h2>The reversed attribute in HTML</h2>\n<p>The easiest and most straightforward solution is the <code>reversed</code> attribute in HTML.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ol reversed&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;B&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>\n<style>\n  .article-list {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n  }\n  .article-list li {\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n  }\n</style>\n<ol reversed class=\"article-list\">\n  <li>C</li>\n  <li>B</li>\n  <li>A</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It reverses the order of the list marker semantically and visually; the list starts with 3. and ends with 1., and screen readers announce the list in <abbr title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr> order together with the correct number. “3 C 2 B 1 A”</p>\n<p>That’s how you do it, you can stop reading here, if you don’t need custom styling and it doesn’t bother you that the <code>reversed</code> attribute is <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=ol-reversed\">not supported in IE and old implementations of Edge</a>.<br />\nKeep reading, if you need more options, better browser support and more flexibility.</p>\n<h2>The value attribute in HTML</h2>\n<p>Another approach, which yields the same result, is using the value attribute on the list items.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li value=\"3\"&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li value=\"2\"&gt;B&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li value=\"1\"&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>\n<ol class=\"article-list\">\n  <li value=\"3\">C</li>\n  <li value=\"2\">B</li>\n  <li value=\"1\">A</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's more verbose, but we also have more control over the list. You could do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li value=\"6\"&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li value=\"4\"&gt;B&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li value=\"2\"&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>\n<ol class=\"article-list\">\n  <li value=\"6\">C</li>\n  <li value=\"4\">B</li>\n  <li value=\"2\">A</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You probably shouldn’t do this because skipping numbers may confuse your users, but it’s possible.</p>\n<h2>Custom counter()s in CSS</h2>\n<p>There aren’t many options to style standard list items and <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-marker-pseudo\">support for the <code>::marker</code> pseudo-element</a> could be better. So, if we want to apply custom styling to our list markers, custom counters in CSS are an option.<br />\nTo reverse the order of custom counters we have 2 things to do: Reset the counter to a value other than 0 and increment the counter with a negative number.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;B&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ol {\n  counter-reset: my-custom-counter 4;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\nol li {\n  counter-increment: my-custom-counter -1;\n}\n\nol li::before {\n  content: counter(my-custom-counter) '. ';\n  color: #f23c50;\n  font-size: 2.5rem;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n.article-list-custom {\n  counter-reset: my-custom-counter 4;\n  padding-left: 20px;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n.article-list-custom li {\n  counter-increment: my-custom-counter -1;\n}\n.article-list-custom li::before {\n  content: counter(my-custom-counter) \". \";\n  color: #f23c50;\n  font-size: 2.5rem;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n<ol class=\"article-list article-list-custom\">\n  <li value=\"6\">C</li>\n  <li value=\"4\">B</li>\n  <li value=\"2\">A</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If we don’t know the exact number of items, we can move the <code>counter-reset</code> property into our HTML and let our back-end programming language or our static site generator do the counting.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ol\n  style=\"counter-reset: my-custom-counter {% raw %}{{ items.length + 1 }}{% endraw %}\"\n&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;B&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ol {\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\nol li {\n  counter-increment: my-custom-counter -1;\n}\n\nol li::before {\n  content: counter(my-custom-counter) '. ';\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>How not to do it</h2>\n<p>Some articles suggested reversing the order of both the list marker and the item itself in CSS using Flexbox or similar techniques. We shouldn’t do that because it only looks correct, but the <abbr title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr> order stays the same. Changing order in CSS has no effect on <abbr title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr> order.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;B&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ol {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column-reverse;\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  .article-list-flexbox {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column-reverse;\n  }\n</style>\n<ol class=\"article-list article-list-flexbox\">\n  <li>A</li>\n  <li>B</li>\n  <li>C</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Visually we get what we wanted, but screen readers follow <abbr title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr> order and announce the list in the order “ABC” and not “CBA”. Also, if you copy and paste the list, browsers might copy it in its original order “ABC”.</p>\n<p>Before I wrap it up, here’s another incredibly creative solution I found on StackOverflow. The result is similar to the Flexbox solution, but there are even more drawbacks (e.g. it messes with scrolling).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;B&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ol {\n  transform: rotate(180deg);\n}\n\nol &gt; li {\n  transform: rotate(-180deg);\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  .article-list-transform {\n    transform: rotate(180deg);\n    padding: 0 40px 0 0;\n  }\n  .article-list-transform > li {\n    transform: rotate(-180deg);\n}\n</style>\n<ol class=\"article-list article-list-transform\">\n  <li>A</li>\n  <li>B</li>\n  <li>C</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have a lot of respect for desperate developers, but for the love of everything that’s important to you, please don’t do that.</p>\n<h2>Got something to share?</h2>\n<p>That’s it, thanks for reading. ❤️ If you know of other approaches or if you have questions, find me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo\">Twitter</a> or write me an <a href=\"mailto:manuel@matuzo.at\">e-mail</a>.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CReverse+ordered+lists%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>According to <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/\">WebAims annual accessibility analysis</a>, 98.1% of home pages of the top 1,000,000 websites have detectable WCAG 2.0 failures. Some of these sites may only have minor contrast issues or maybe just a single missing <code>id</code>, while others are highly inaccessible. However, this number is pretty damn high, considering the fact that automatic testing tools <a href=\"https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/\">only report obvious accessibility issues</a>.</p><p>Only 1.9% of the tested home pages pass automatic testing, which is fine, but it doesn’t mean that <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/\">there aren’t any barriers on these websites</a> either. True accessibility extends beyond automated tests and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG</a> regulations.</p>\n<p>It's fair to say that most websites are <strong>only accessible to some</strong>.</p>\n<p>98.1% sounds bad, but for most of us it’s just a number, isn’t it? For me, as someone whose job it is to help others build accessible websites, it’s easier to imagine what the real-life effects of these failures can be. To help you get a better understanding of what this high percentage means for users and their daily experiences on the web, I created a little experiment.</p>\n<p>My partner is an architect, and she sparked my interest in modern architecture. That’s why I built a web page about an architectural movement in Europe, and for my experiment I would like you to open the page and read it. Once you’re finished, try to summarise what you’ve just learned, rate your experience and then please come back to the article.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdpn.io/matuzo/debug/LYGxLLJ\">The experiment.</a></p>\n<p>Impressive stuff, right? I hope that you could access most of the information without using DevTools. I did everything I can to make it as accessible as possible. If you had trouble understanding what the page was about, please note that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our developers (me) spent countless hours optimising the accessibility and we’re proud that <a href=\"https://web.dev/measure/\">Lighthouse</a>, <a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/\">Wave</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\">Axe</a> don’t throw any errors.<br />\nIt’s <strong>100% accessible</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>It’s your choice how you access the page</strong>, but it’s optimised for desktop screen readers. You will have the best experience if you don’t use a mouse. You can <a href=\"https://www.nvaccess.org/download/\">download NVDA for free</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1273332642113617921\">This is an early version of the web page</a> and we’re exploring ways to make these types of pages accessible to everyone.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, <strong>we don’t have the budget</strong> to optimise it for non-screen reader users. The money is not worth spending on this niche market.</li>\n<li><strong>Why would people using a mouse want to access a website</strong> about expressionist architecture anyway!?</li>\n<li>We focus on our target audience, VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA, and JAWS users, but we’re also evaluating <strong>accessibility widgets</strong> that we might add to the website for others. This improvement will allow you to click around as much as you want and optimise the website to your needs.<br />\nThis will make the website <strong><a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2015/11/be-wary-of-add-on-accessibility.html\">120% accessible</a>.</strong></li>\n<li>We’re known for top-of-the-line websites and we’re constantly exploring new technology. We’re considering using <abbr title=\"artificial intelligence\">AI</abbr> to draw images based on the information in the <code>alt</code> attribute.<br />\nBased on the <code>alt</code> text <em>“A long rectangular building. Besides looking like a ship, Het Schip resembles a bizarre art form. Its appearance is unconventional from all angles. The exterior consists of bright orange bricks, decked with towers and architectural elements in unconventional shapes.”</em> our <abbr title=\"artificial intelligence\">AI</abbr> super algorithms created the following image:</li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,q_90,w_800/v1592974740/articles/hetschip_comparison.jpg\" alt=\"In the upper half of the image: A photo of Het Schip.

How does that feel? Especially with my bullshit justifications. Pretty bad, right? Now imagine having a similar experience on most websites you visit. That’s not just annoying and troublesome, but it makes you angry and sad.</p>\n<p>Please remember how this experience made you feel every time you work on a new website, page, or component.

Please be aware that most of the following code samples (I’ve marked those that aren’t bad) illustrate poor and dangerous practices. I wrote them just to make a point, don’t use this code on real websites.</p>\n<h3>Labels</h3>\n<p>It’s hard to understand what a page is about, if there’s no <code>h1</code> or if it isn’t labelled properly.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;h1 aria-label=\"Expressionist architecture\"&gt;Document title&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>“Document title” is shown, but a screen reader announces “Expressionist architecture”.<br />\nNote: <code>aria-label</code> must not be used that way. You don’t need it, if there’s text content already.</p>\n<h4>Further reading</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/#headings\">Semantic Structure: Regions, Headings, and Lists</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Control hints</h3>\n<p>Screen readers provide users with instructions on how to interact with elements like links.

Applied to the <code>html</code> element, it tells screen readers the natural language of the page. A screen reader might not detect the language automatically; the <code>lang</code> attribute helps it pick the right voice profile.</p>\n<p>If you switch language within a sentence, you can use the <code>lang</code> attribute to mark a word or phrase. (That’s a good practice.)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;p&gt;There's a certain &lt;span lang=\"fr\"&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;/span&gt; in the air.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>If you don’t do that, it might cause an English voice profile pronouncing a German sentence with an English accent.

    "title": "Writing even more CSS with Accessibility in Mind, Part 1: Progressive Enhancement",
    "partialText": "<p>About 4 years ago, <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/my-accessibility-journey-what-ive-learned-so-far/\">I began to focus on web accessibility</a> professionally. I read many articles and books, watched talks, followed experts, and I also shared my knowledge at meet-ups and online. The first 3 articles I wrote were <a href=\"https://medium.com/alistapart/writing-html-with-accessibility-in-mind-a62026493412\">Writing HTML with Accessibility in Mind</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-javascript-with-accessibility-in-mind-a1f6a5f467b9\">Writing JavaScript with Accessibility in Mind</a>, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@matuzo/writing-css-with-accessibility-in-mind-8514a0007939\">Writing CSS with Accessibility in Mind</a>. I've shared the most exciting new things I've learned about creating inclusive experiences in each language.</p><p>I wrote <em>Writing CSS with Accessibility in Mind</em> in 2017 and I’ve covered topics like font size, line height, print style sheets, hiding content, contrast, DOM order vs. visual order and focus styles. 3 years have passed, CSS has evolved, and I’ve learned new things. Therefore, I’ve decided to write about <em>even more CSS with accessibility in mind</em>.</p>\n<h2>In this series</h2>\n<p>This series of articles covers 4 major topics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Progressive enhancement <em>(this article)</em></strong></li>\n<li>User preferences <em>(coming soon)</em></li>\n<li>CSS and semantics <em>(coming soon)</em></li>\n<li>Improving accessibility with CSS <em>(coming soon)</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Progressive enhancement basics</h2>\n<style>\n  .css2-pe-l-h {\n    color: #d25632; \n    font-weight:bold\n  }\n  .css2-pe-l-c {\n    color: #1b73ba; \n    font-weight:bold\n  }\n  .css2-pe-l-j {\n    color: #9b8800; \n    font-weight:bold\n  }\n</style>\n<p>I strongly believe in progressive enhancement because it focuses on content and enhances experiences layer by layer. We start with a basic but resilient foundation that works in most browsers: a well structured and semantic <span class=\"css2-pe-l-h\">HTML document</span>. We enhance it with design and visual improvements by adding <span class=\"css2-pe-l-c\">CSS</span>. If the browser doesn’t support CSS at all or just some properties, the site is still accessible, thanks to our strong foundation. Finally, we may add <span class=\"css2-pe-l-j\">JavaScript</span> to enhance the experience even more. We should <a href=\"https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019\">be careful with JavaScript</a> because it can affect performance negatively, especially on mobile devices.</p>\n<style>\n    .css2-pe {\n      font-family: sans-serif;\n      line-height: 1.5;\n    }\n    .css2-pe ol {\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 19.2rem 0 0 3.2rem;\n      position: relative;\n      transform: rotate(0);\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n    @media (min-width: 768px) {\n      .css2-pe ol {\n        padding: 2.4rem 0 0 14.4rem;\n      }\n    }\n    .css2-pe li {\n      opacity: 0.8;\n      margin-bottom: 0;\n      position: relative;\n    }\n    .css2-pe li > * {\n      padding-bottom: 1rem !important;\n      display: inline-block;\n      font-weight: normal;\n    }\n    li::before {\n      display: block;\n      content: \"\";\n      width: 11rem;\n      height: 11rem;\n      position: fixed;\n      left: 0;\n      top: 0;\n      border-radius: 50%;\n      opacity: 0.1;\n      transition: opacity 0.3s;\n    }\n    li.css2-pe-html,\n    li.css2-pe-html span {\n      color: #d25632;\n      opacity: 1\n    }\n    .css2-pe-html::before {\n      background: #d25632;\n      width: 4.2rem;\n      height: 4.2rem;\n      z-index: 3;\n      top: 3.4rem;\n      left: 3.4rem;\n      opacity: 1;\n    }\n    .css2-pe-css::before {\n      background: #1b73ba;\n      width: 7.8rem;\n      height: 7.8rem;\n      z-index: 2;\n      top: 1.6rem;\n      left: 1.6rem;\n    }\n    .css2-pe-html {\n      z-index: 3;\n    }\n    .css2-pe-css,\n    .css2-pe-css span {\n      color:#1b73ba;\n      z-index: 2;\n    }\n    .css2-pe-js,\n    .css2-pe-js span {\n      color: #9b8800;\n      z-index: 1;\n    }\n    .css2-pe-js::before {\n      background: #f3df4f;\n    }\n    .css2-pe-html span,\n    .css2-pe--active span {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n    .css2-pe--active,\n    .css2-pe--active::before {\n      opacity: 1;\n      cursor: default;\n    }\n    s {\n      text-decoration-color: black;\n    }\n</style>\n<div class=\"css2-pe js-css2-pe\">\n  <ol>\n    <li class=\"css2-pe-html\"><span>HTML - Semantic markup</span></li>\n    <li class=\"css2-pe-css\"><span>CSS - Design and visual improvements</span></li>\n    <li class=\"css2-pe-js\"><span>JS - Enhanceed experience</span></li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n<script>\n  var css2pe = document.querySelector('.js-css2-pe').querySelectorAll('li');\n  var peHighlight = function (elem, e) {\n    for (var j = 0;

I just built it that way to illustrate progressive enhancement. If you want to learn how to create accessible toggle buttons, read <a href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/toggle-button/\">Toggle Buttons</a> by Heydon Pickering.</p>\n</div>\n<p>We've started with a basic but resilient foundation that works in most browsers and we've enhanced it feature by feature. Instead of loading multiple megabytes of polyfills, compiled JavaScript and CSS workarounds onto users, we only give browsers code they can handle without additional help. This usually results in less JavaScript and CSS, better performance and happier users. Progressive enhancement is the key to giving more people access to our content by serving code according to the capabilities of the end user’s browser and device.</p>\n<p>I’ve been following the basics of this principle for many years, but only recently I discovered how I can bring my practices up to date and use progressive enhancement together with modern CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n<h3>Rediscovering Progressive Enhancement</h3>\n<p>Nokia released an updated version of its iconic Nokia 3310 a few years ago. I bought it because it was affordable and I wanted to see how the surfing experience was in Opera Mini. You can download Opera Mini to your Android or iOS phone, too, but by default there isn’t much of a difference between Opera Mini and the default browser on these devices. Opera Mini on the Nokia 3310 runs on an operating system called Nokia Series 30+ and its function range is quite limited. If you search for almost any feature on <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/\">caniuse.com</a> and you see a red rectangle, that’s the Opera Mini we’re talking about. I’ve tested a website I’ve recently built using modern CSS and JS on the Nokia 3310 and after some minor tweaks it worked. Just like that. Guess why! Exactly, progressive enhancement.<br />\nThe fact that JavaScript is just another layer and not a dependency allows users with low-end devices to access the website.</p>\n<div class=\"css2-pe\">\n  <ol>\n    <li class=\"css2-pe-html\"><span>HTML - Semantic markup</span></li>\n    <li class=\"css2-pe-css css2-pe--active\"><span>CSS - Design and visual improvements</span></li>\n    <li class=\"css2-pe-js\"><span><s>JS - Enhanceed experience</s></span></li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n<p>You can read more about the process in <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/beauty-of-progressive-enhancement/\">The beauty of progressive enhancement</a>.</p>\n<p>HTML, CSS and JS are large layers in our progressively enhanced website, but each layer may comprise even more layers.</p>\n<h2>Progressively enhancing CSS</h2>\n<p>There are different ways in CSS to define layers and help browsers serve them accordingly.</p>\n<h3>Let CSS do its thing</h3>\n<p>CSS has progressive enhancement at its core. This is best illustrated by its error handling: <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#error-handling\">When errors occur in CSS</a>, the parser doesn’t stop, but it attempts to only skip content it can’t interpret before returning to parsing as normal.</p>\n<p>The following code won’t throw any errors, the CSS parser will just skip the line it doesn’t understand and apply a <code>#153a51</code> color and <code>#36b1bf</code> background color to all <code>div</code> elements.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  color: #153a51;\n  css-is: amazing;\n  background: #36b1bf;\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  .css2-error {\n    color: #153a51; \n    background: #36b1bf;\n    width: 10rem;\n    height: 10rem;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    font-size: 2rem;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"css2-error\">\n  CSS &lt;3\n</div>\n<p>The parser skips the second line in the declaration block because the property <code>css-is</code> doesn’t exist, but errors aren’t always mistakes. A browser like Firefox might interpret a new property without issues, while the same property looks like an error in Internet Explorer. For example: If you add the following rule to a style sheet, modern browsers apply a grid with 2 <code>150px</code> columns to each unordered list, while browsers that don’t support CSS Grid Layout just skip the Grid declarations.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul {\n  display: flex; /* Fallback for older browsers */\n  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allow items to wrap */\n  display: grid; /* Most modern browsers */\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(\n    auto-fill,\n    150px\n  ); /* Add as many 150px columns per line as possible */\n}\n\nul &gt; * {\n  border: 1px solid #36b1bf;\n  margin: 0 0.5rem;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>A modern browser first sets the <code>display</code> property to <code>flex</code> and allows wrapping of flex items, then it overwrites the first declaration and sets the <code>display</code> to <code>grid</code> and forgets about wrapping again because <code>flex-wrap</code> doesn’t work with grid items. Last, it adds grid columns with its own wrapping mechanism.</p>\n<style>\n.css2-listgrid {\n  display: flex; \n  flex-wrap: wrap; \n  list-style: none;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n.css2-listgrid--grid {\n  display: grid; \n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 150px);\n}\n.css2-listgrid > * {\n  border: 1px solid #36b1bf;\n  margin-bottom: 0 !important;\n  margin: 0 0.5rem;\n}\n</style>\n<ul class=\"css2-listgrid css2-listgrid--grid\">\n  <li>Element 1</li>\n  <li>Element 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An older browser sets <code>display</code> to <code>flex</code> and allows wrapping of flex items and skips the rest.<br />\nThe list looks a little different, but most users probably won’t even notice.</p>\n<ul class=\"css2-listgrid\">\n  <li>Element 1</li>\n  <li>Element 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Here’s another example:</strong><br />\nWe can use <code>shape-outside</code> to make a paragraph that wraps an image look more interesting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_1200/v1599629649/articles/Screen_Shot_2020-08-15_at_13.22.43.png\" alt=\"A photo of a dog from the side looking up wearing a red party hat with white dots and text that wraps around the shape of the dogs head and body.\" /></p>\n<noscript><img class=\"no-script\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_1200/v1599629649/articles/Screen_Shot_2020-08-15_at_13.22.43.png\" alt=\"A photo of a dog from the side looking up wearing a red party hat with white dots and text that wraps around the shape of the dogs head and body.\"></noscript>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;img\n  src=\"dog.jpg\"\n  width=\"400\"\n  alt=\"A dog from the side looking up wearing a red party hat with white dots\"\n/&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

I like to make sure that they only get as much code as they need to access the content and still get a decent experience. Anything extra will only be served to more capable browsers and potentially faster devices. This means I have to decide at which point I want to draw the line between full and limited functionality for certain features. There are different ways of doing that.</p>\n<p><strong>Let CSS do its thing 2</strong></p>\n<p>Again, we can let CSS do its thing. For example, if we don’t want to bother users of legacy browsers with having to download hundreds of kilobytes in font files, we can serve our fonts only in the <code>woff2</code> format (<a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#search=woff2\">see .woff2 support on caniuse.com</a>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Lobster';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  font-display: swap;\n  src: local('Lobster'), url('fonts/Lobster-Regular.woff2') format('woff2');\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-family: Lobster, sans-serif;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Since a browser like Internet Explorer doesn’t support <code>woff2</code> it won’t try to download the file and it will use the <code>sans-serif</code> fallback font. (Instead of just relying on the generic font family as a fallback, you could also use a system font similar in style and shape).</p>\n<p><strong>Feature detection in CSS</strong></p>\n<p>Another approach, often referred to as “<a href=\"https://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard\">cutting the mustard</a>”, is to check whether a browser supports a certain feature and only then, if it cuts the mustard, serve additional code.</p>\n<p>We could make a basic vertical layout and enhance it only if the browser supports custom properties. Feature detection is built into CSS in the form of the <code>@supports</code> at-rule <abbr title=\"also knows as\">aka</abbr> <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports\">feature queries</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:root {\n  --display: flex;\n  --gap: 1rem;\n}\n\n/* Applied in all browsers */\nul {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n/* Only browsers that support custom properties */\n@supports (display: var(--supports)) {\n  ul {\n    display: var(--display);\n    gap: var(--gap);\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-featurequeries\">Most browsers support feature queries</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It’s not possible to check support for a property only, you have to provide a value for the property. Something like <code>@supports (display) {}</code> won’t work.</p>\n<p><strong>Feature detection in JS</strong></p>\n<p>I've built a large website recently with many components, some of them enhanced with JavaScript. Each component works with and without JavaScript. This is important because we only serve a critical amount of JavaScript to users of legacy browsers, which means that they will see most components in their no-JS state.</p>\n<p>We’re cutting the mustard by adding this block of Javascript to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our site.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;script type=\"module\"&gt;\n    // Add the `.js` class to the &lt;html&gt; element\n    document.documentElement.classList.add('js');\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>type=\"module\"</code> attribute and value ensures that the scripts block will be only executed, if the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module\">browsers supports JavaScript modules</a>. What’s great about this is that even with the attribute in place we don’t actually have to use JavaScript modules, we can write our JavaScript as usual.</p>\n<p>If the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element contains the class <code>js</code>, we know that it’s a modern browser because it supports JavaScript modules. This allows us to style components accordingly.</p>\n<p>In an accordion component, for example, the content is visible by default.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"accordion\"&gt;\n    &lt;h3 class=\"accordion__heading\"&gt;Accordion Heading&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"accordion__panel\"&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        Accordion panel content visibile by default and only hidden, if the\n        `.js` class is present.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\n<style>\n.css2-pe-example {\n  width: 85%;\n  padding: 2rem;\n  border: 5px solid #36b1bf;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n.css2-pe-example .accordion__heading {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n.css2-pe-example .accordion__panel--js {\n  display: none;\n}\n.css2-pe-example .accordion__panel--visible {\n  display: block;\n}\n.accordion__heading button {\n  appearance: none;\n  border: none;\n  padding: none;\n  font-size: inherit;\n  font-family: inherit;\n  padding: 0;\n  color: inherit;\n  font-weight: inherit;\n}\n</style>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"css2-pe-example\">\n    <div class=\"accordion\">\n      <h3 class=\"accordion__heading\">Accordion Heading</h3>\n      <div class=\"accordion__panel\">\n        <p>Accordion panel content visibile by default and only hidden, if the `.js` class is present.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>We hide the content (<code>.accordion__panel</code>) and add attributes, events, etc. only if the browsers cuts the mustard.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.js .accordion__panel {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n.js .accordion__panel--visible {\n  display: block;\n}\n\n.accordion__heading button {\n  appearance: none;\n  border: none;\n  padding: none;\n  font-size: inherit;\n  font-family: inherit;\n  padding: 0;\n  color: inherit;\n  font-weight: inherit;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>We replace the text content within the heading with a button and add a click event to the button that toggles the visibility of the panel.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Select elements\nconst accordion = document.querySelector('.js-accordion');\nconst heading = accordion.querySelector('h3');\nconst panel = accordion.querySelector('div');\nconst btn = document.createElement('button');\n\n// The panel is hidden by default, so set aria-expanded to false\nbtn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', false);\n// Associate the button with the panel (works only with some screen readers)\nbtn.setAttribute('aria-controls', 'panel_1');\npanel.id = 'panel_1';\n\n// Event that toggles aria-expanded and the panel visibility\nbtn.addEventListener('click', (e) =&gt; {\n  const state = btn.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true' ? false : true;\n  btn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', state);\n  panel.classList.toggle('accordion__panel--visible');\n});\n\n// Replace text in heading with the button\nbtn.textContent = heading.textContent;\nheading.textContent = '';\nheading.appendChild(btn);</code></pre>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"css2-pe-example\">\n    <div class=\"accordion js-accordion\">\n      <h3 class=\"accordion__heading\">Accordion Heading</h3>\n      <div class=\"accordion__panel accordion__panel--js\">\n        <p>Accordion panel content visibile by default and only hidden, if the `.js` class is present.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<script>\n  var accordion = document.querySelector('.js-accordion')\n  var heading = accordion.querySelector('h3')\n  var panel = accordion.querySelector('div')\n  var btn = document.createElement('button');\n  btn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', false)\n  btn.setAttribute('aria-controls', 'panel_1')\n  btn.id = 'acc_1' \n  btn.textContent = heading.textContent\n  btn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {\n    var state = btn.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true' ? false : true;\n    btn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', state)\n    console.log(btn.getAttribute('aria-expanded'))\n    panel.classList.toggle('accordion__panel--visible')\n  })\n  heading.textContent = ''\n  heading.appendChild(btn)\n  panel.id = 'panel_1'\n</script>\n<p>What’s great about this approach is that we can use <abbr title=\"ECMAScript\">ES6</abbr> without having to compile it with Babel because a browser that supports JS Modules also support ES6 syntax. No JavaScript for users of legacy browsers and less JS for everyone else 🎉.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;script src=\"accordion.js\" type=\"module\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This accordion is not complete.

    "partialText": "<p>In the first article of this series, I explained how important progressive enhancement is for web accessibility. Building websites layer by layer allows for a cleaner separation of concerns and more resilient experiences. This second article is about user preferences and how to respect them when writing CSS.</p><h2>In this series</h2>\n<p>This series of articles covers 4 major topics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/writing-even-more-css-with-accessibility-in-mind-progressive-enhancement/\">Progressive enhancement</a></li>\n<li><strong>User preferences <em>(this article)</em></strong></li>\n<li>CSS and semantics <em>(coming soon)</em></li>\n<li>Improving accessibility with CSS <em>(coming soon)</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Respecting user preferences</h2>\n<p>Operating systems and browsers provide users with options to customize their browsing experience, and it’s our job to respect these preferences in our style sheets. In the following chapter, I’ll give you examples of how we can build designs according to our ideas while still respecting user preferences.</p>\n<h3>Font size</h3>\n<p>A fundamental thing we should do is respect our users’ preferred font size for running text.</p>\n<h4>Base font size</h4>\n<p>The default font size in most browsers is <code>16px</code> but it can be changed to a lower or higher value in the browser preferences.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000/v1602476047/articles/ff_settings.jpg\" alt=\"Language and Appearance settings in Firefox. Font site dropdown active. Screenshot.\">\n<figcaption>\nIn Firefox: Firefox → Preferences → Language and Appearance\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>If an user sets the default font size to <code>20px</code>, we should make sure that the size of running text doesn’t get lower than that on our website. We can do that by using relative units instead of absolute units. The problem with absolute units is that if we set the font size to <code>18px</code> on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, it overwrites the <code>20px</code> our user has chosen as their default, and that wouldn’t be nice of us.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  /* Don’t use px for font sizes (...in most cases) */\n  font-size: 18px;\n}</code></pre>\n<h5>Video demo:</h5>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" title=\"Accessible CSS demo: font-size property with an absolute value\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_leBu4I1yqc\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n<br>\n<p>If we use a relative unit like <code>rem</code>, instead, we can still define our preferred size while respecting user preferences. <code>1rem</code> is relative to the root font size, as already mentioned, <code>16px</code> in most browsers. This means that the the size of <code>1rem</code> changes with the default font size in the browser.</p>\n<p>If we want to use this unit, we have to convert <code>px</code> to <code>rem</code>. We can do that by taking the target value (<code>18px</code>) and dividing it by the default root value (<code>16px</code>):</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n  <img class=\"234\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_350/v1602477333/articles/article_css2_calc.png\" alt=\"18px/16px = 1.125rem\">\n</div>\n<p>The result is the <code>rem</code> value. If we use it instead of the absolute pixel value, the font size for users with standard settings will still equal <code>18px</code>, but the font size for users who prefer a larger base font size like <code>20px</code> will be <code>22.5px</code> (1rem = 20px, 1.125rem = 22.5px).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  font-size: 1.125rem; /* 16 * 1.125 = 18px */\n}</code></pre>\n<h5>Video demo:</h5>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" title=\"Accessible CSS demo: font-size property with a relative value\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vE_0JWb9iOA\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n<br>\n<p>It makes sense to use relative units like <code>rem</code>, <code>em</code>, or <code>%</code> because they’re relative to a parents font size when used with the <code>font-size</code> property. Other relative units like <code>vh</code> or <code>vw</code> are not suitable because they’re relative to the viewport. Even combinations of units like <code>calc(2vw + 0.5rem)</code>should be treated with caution because they might lead to unexpected results. Read <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html\">Responsive Type and Zoom</a> by Adrian Roselli for details.</p>\n<p><strong>Line lengths</strong></p>\n<p>I like to constrain the width of content container elements to improve readability by ensuring that lines don’t exceed a certain length. I use the <code>ch</code> (character) unit for that. <code>1ch</code> is as wide as the glyph 0 (zero) in the respective font and size. If we set the <code>max-width</code> to <code>80ch</code>, only approximately 80 characters will fit each line. A pleasant side effect is that when users change the default font size, the width of the content container grows with the size of the font. The relative unit <code>ch</code> makes sure that there’s always a pleasant font size to line length ratio, no matter how large the text is.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.content {\n  max-width: 80ch;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/RwaZNVa?editors=1100\">ch unit Demo on CodePen.</a></p>\n<h5>Video demo:</h5>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" title=\"Accessible CSS demo: difference between px and ch in max-width declarations.\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LR9HnV-j7Q\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n<h3>Motion and animation</h3>\n<p>Animations on the web are sometimes annoying, but they may also cause nausea, dizziness, and headaches in some users. For people with vestibular disorders it may even cause pain and make them feel so bad that they have to stop using the computer, needing time to recover. Earlier this year I read “<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/accessibility-for-vestibular/\">Accessibility for Vestibular Disorders: How My Temporary Disability Changed My Perspective</a>” by Facundo Corradini and it blew my mind because it was the first time that I read about the negative side effects of animations on the web by someone who experienced it first-hand. Facundo is a developer, and he describes which patterns and effects were especially bad and made him feel dizzy and sick.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Really, there are no words to describe just how bad a simple parallax effect, scrolljacking, or even <code>background-attachment: fixed</code> would make me feel. I would rather jump on one of those 20-G centrifuges astronauts use than look at a website with parallax scrolling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also describes how distracting animations can be when you’re having a hard time focussing itself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The extreme, conscious, focused effort it took to read would make it such that anything moving on the screen would instantly break my focus, and force me to start the paragraph all over. And I mean anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can highly recommend this article, it outlines well how important it is to use animation on the web cautiously. Now let’s see how we can do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduce or remove motion if users prefer reduced motion</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2019/05/short-note-on-prefers-reduced-motion-and-puzzled-windows-users/\">Some operating systems allow users to reduce motion</a>, and we can react to that in CSS by using the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media feature. If our users prefer less motion on the screen, we should respect that and serve CSS without or with fewer animations and transitions.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example: If you don’t have any preference for reduced motion, you should see someone moonwalking from one end of the article to the other. If you do, you should see someone moonwalking in place.</p>\n<style>\n@keyframes walk {\n  0% {\n    transform: translateX(800px);\n  }\n}\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n  .moonwalk img {\n    animation: walk 10s linear infinite;\n  }\n}\n.moonwalk {\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n.moonwalk img { border: none}\n</style>\n<div class=\"moonwalk\">\n    <picture>\n        <source srcset=\"https://assets.codepen.io/144736/moonwalk.gif\" media=\"(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)\">\n        <img class=\"p\" src=\"https://assets.codepen.io/144736/moonwalk.png\" alt=\"Someone doing the moon walk.\">\n    </picture>\n</div>\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/lassediercks/pen/MEmEyj\">Marquee Jackson</a> by Lasse Diercks.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;img\n  src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/EDZP0UCtxiRQQ/giphy.gif\"\n  alt=\"Person doing the moon walk.\"\n/&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* Define keyframe animation */\n@keyframes walk {\n  0% {\n    transform: translateX(100vw);\n  }\n}\n\n/* Apply animation */\nimg {\n  animation: walk 10s linear infinite;\n}\n\n/* Remove animation if the user prefers reduced motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  img {\n    animation: none;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>We could go one step further and replace the gif with a png by using a combination of the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media feature and the picture element.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;picture&gt;\n  &lt;source srcset=\"moonwalk.png\" media=\"(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)\" /&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"moonwalk.gif\" alt=\"Someone doing the moonwalk\" /&gt;\n&lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/NWrWeNq?editors=1100\">picture element and prefers-reduced-motion demo on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>In this example I set the <code>animation</code> property to <code>none</code> , but you don’t always have to remove motion entirely. Eric W. Bailey points out that <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-prefers-reduced-motion-the-reduced-motion-media-query/#article-header-id-5\">animation isn’t bad per se</a>, because it may help users, especially people with cognitive disabilities, understand the relationship between seemingly disparate objects. Val Head outlines even more benefits of animations in “<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/#section7\">Designing Safer Web Animation For Motion Sensitivity</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/design-reduced-motion-sensitivities/\">Designing With Reduced Motion For Motion Sensitivities</a>”.</p>\n<p><strong>Progressive enhancement applied to animation</strong></p>\n<p>It’s important to respect user preferences, but this approach, applying animation and conditionally removing it, isn’t perfect. The reduced motion media feature was introduced only a few years ago, which means that <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=prefers-reduced-motion\">users of legacy browsers will see animations no matter what</a>.</p>\n<p>Most articles recommend something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* Apply animations and transitions */\nimg {\n  animation: walk 10s linear infinite;\n}\n\ndiv {\n  transition: transform 1s ease-in;\n}\n\n/* Select all elements in the page and reduce or remove motion. */\n/* Important note: This has no effect in browsers that don’t support prefers-reduced-motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation: none !important;\n    transition: none !important;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>That’s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrick_h_lauke\">Patrick H. Lauke</a> recommends a <a href=\"https://codepen.io/patrickhlauke/pen/YzPPdeo\">defensive prefers-reduced-motion use</a> where animations only run in browsers that support the media feature and only if they have <em>not</em> expressed a preference for reduced motion.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* has no effect in browsers that don’t support prefers-reduced-motion */\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n  img {\n    animation: walk 10s linear infinite;\n  }\n\n  div {\n    transition: transform 1s ease-in;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>I like this approach because it’s more sensitive towards users and it takes progressive enhancement one step further. We start with no animation and only add this layer of enhancement if the browser supports the media feature and the user has no preference for reduced motion.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how I’ve used the media feature in a website I’ve recently built. We only animate <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior\">scrolling to anchor links</a>, if users have no preference for reduced motion.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n  html {\n    scroll-behavior: smooth;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/bGprNYo\">Smooth scrolling demo on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>Please respect your user’s motion preferences in your style sheets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using this media query could spare someone from having to unnecessarily endure a tremendous amount of pain for simply having the curiosity to click on a link or scroll down a page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>- <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericwbailey\">Eric Bailey</a></p>\n<h3>Dark Mode</h3>\n<p>Another setting some operating systems provide is the ability to switch the default theme from one that uses light colors to one that uses dark colors (<a href=\"https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2020-01-23-operating-system-and-browser-accessibility-display-modes/#toc_Dark-Mode\">Dark Mode</a>). That’s especially useful for people who want to reduce eye strain or for people who have certain photosensitive conditions.</p>\n<p>The media feature <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> allows us to react to these settings and provide users with a dark or light design accordingly.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  /* Dark text on light background */\n  color: #222222;\n  background-color: #ffffff;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  body {\n    /* Light text on dark background */\n    color: #ffffff;\n    background-color: #222222;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>I did some research and collected useful tips and tricks for working with Dark Mode.</p>\n<h4>1. Change the design according to user preference but allow users to change it back.</h4>\n<p>Some users may prefer a dark theme for the OS but light themes on the web. They should be able to pick their preferred theme. You can see how Cassie Evans does it on her website <a href=\"https://www.cassie.codes/\">cassie.codes</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"figure\">\n<a href=\"https://cassie.codes\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,q_100,w_1000/v1602564954/articles/article_css2_cassie.jpg\" alt=\"A styled switch that looks like a sun or moon depending on the mode at the top right corner on Cassie Evans website\"></a>\n<figcaption>\nComparison of light and dark mode.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>2. Try to avoid hard contrasts like <code>#FFFFFF</code> text color on a <code>#000000</code> background.</h4>\n<p>Use softer combinations like <code>#EFEFEF</code> on <code>#111111</code>, which are easier on the eyes.</p>\n<style>\n.a-up-color {\n  display: flex;\n}\n.a-up-color div {\n  max-width: 150px;\n  height: 150px;\n  width: 48%;\n  background: #000;\n  color: #fff;\n  margin-right: 2%;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n.a-up-color div + div {\n  margin-right: 0;\n  background: #111111;\n  color: #EFEFEF;\n}\n</style>\n<div class=\"a-up-color\">\n  <div>\n  #FFFFFF on #000000\n  </div>\n  <div>\n  #EFEFEF on #111111\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>3. <a href=\"https://markdotto.com/2018/11/05/css-dark-mode/\">Dim images</a> by decreasing the <code>opacity</code>.</h4>\n<p>Dark backgrounds may amplify the brightness of light images, dimming images can help with that.

Simply inverting colors might not be want you want.</h4>\n<p>Some articles recommend to simply invert colors and call it a day. While this might work on some sites, it doesn’t mean that it works well.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html,\nbody {\n  background-color: #fff;\n}\n\nbody {\n  color: #222;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  html {\n    /* Invert the colors */\n    filter: invert(100%);\n  }\n\n  img {\n    filter: invert(100%); /* Invert the colors in images back to normal */\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/ExKKMGw\">Dark Mode with filter: invert(100%) on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>The <code>filter</code> property and <code>invert</code> function reverts colors in a page.</p>\n<p>That’s not a best practice because just like you’ve picked the right combination of colors for your default theme carefully, you want to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/1151160261170126850\">hand-pick the colors for your dark theme</a>, too. However, on a component level <code>filter: invert(100%)</code> might work well, so I’d keep it in my tool set.</p>\n<h4>5. Use the <code>currentColor</code> keyword in SVGs for <code>fill</code> or <code>stroke</code> properties instead of absolute values.</h4>\n<p>In this simplified example you can see that the fill color of the SVG in the button is always the same as the text color of the button.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button&gt;\n  Sign up\n  &lt;svg height=\"50\" width=\"50\" focusable=\"false\"&gt;\n    &lt;circle cx=\"25\" cy=\"25\" r=\"20\"&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">button {\n  color: #f00;\n}\n\ncircle {\n  fill: #f00;\n}\n\nbutton:hover {\n  color: #0f0;\n}\n\nbutton:hover circle {\n  fill: #0f0;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  button {\n    color: #00f;\n  }\n\n  circle {\n    fill: #00f;\n  }\n\n  button:hover {\n    color: #f0f;\n  }\n\n  button:hover circle {\n    fill: #f0f;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n.a-up-button {\n  background: #153a51;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  border: none;\n  font-size: 2rem;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  padding: 0.3rem 0.7rem;\n}\n.a-up-button1 {\n  color: #F00;\n}\n.a-up-button1 circle {\n  fill: #F00;\n}\n.a-up-button1:hover {\n  color: #0F0;\n}\n.a-up-button1:hover circle {\n  fill: #0F0;\n}\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .a-up-button1 {\n    color: #00F\n  }\n  .a-up-button1 circle {\n    fill: #00F;\n  }\n  .a-up-button1:hover {\n    color: #F0F;\n  }\n  .a-up-button1:hover circle{\n    fill: #F0F;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n<div>\n<button class=\"a-up-button a-up-button1\" type=\"button\">\n  Sign up\n  <svg height=\"50\" width=\"50\" focusable=\"false\">\n    <circle cx=\"25\" cy=\"25\" r=\"20\">\n  </svg>\n</button>\n</div>\n<p>It works but the code is too verbose. We can reduce the number of lines and make it more dynamic by using the <code>currentColor</code> keyword. <code>currentColor</code>is relative to the <code>color</code> property of the element or its parent element, it changes with the color on hover, focus, Dark Mode, etc.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">button {\n  color: #f00;\n}\n\nbutton:hover {\n  color: #0f0;\n}\n\ncircle {\n  fill: currentColor;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  button {\n    color: #00f;\n  }\n\n  button:hover {\n    color: #f0f;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n.a-up-button2 {\n  color: #F00;\n}\n.a-up-button2:hover {\n  color: #0F0;\n}\n.a-up-button2 circle {\n  fill: currentColor;\n}\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .a-up-button2 {\n    color: #00F\n  }\n  .a-up-button2:hover {\n    color: #F0F;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n<div>\n<button class=\"a-up-button a-up-button2\" type=\"button\">\n  Sign up\n  <svg height=\"50\" width=\"50\" focusable=\"false\">\n    <circle cx=\"25\" cy=\"25\" r=\"20\">\n  </svg>\n</button>\n</div>\n<p>For the sake of completeness, here’s an example that uses custom properties and <code>currentColor</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:root {\n  --color: #f00;\n  --color_hover: #0f0;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  :root {\n    --color: #00f;\n    --color_hover: #f0f;\n  }\n}\n\nbutton {\n  color: var(--color);\n}\n\nbutton:hover {\n  color: var(--color_hover);\n}\n\ncircle {\n  fill: currentColor;\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n:root {\n  --up_color: #F00;\n  --up_color_hover: #0F0;\n}\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  :root {\n    --up_color: #00F;\n    --up_color_hover: #F0F;\n  }\n}\n.a-up-button3 {\n  color: var(--up_color);\n}\n.a-up-button3:hover {\n  color: var(--up_color_hover);\n}\n.a-up-button3 circle {\n  fill: currentColor;\n}\n</style>\n<div>\n<button class=\"a-up-button a-up-button3\" type=\"button\">\n  Sign up\n  <svg height=\"50\" width=\"50\" focusable=\"false\">\n    <circle cx=\"25\" cy=\"25\" r=\"20\">\n  </svg>\n</button>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/ExKvjWP\">currentColor demo on CodePen</a></p>\n<h4>6. Swapping images</h4>\n<p>CSS has its limitations when it comes to swaping colors or manipulating colors in images. Sometimes its necessary to swap entire images. I found this great solution on <a href=\"https://nandovieira.com/supporting-dark-mode-in-web-content\">Nando Vieras blog</a> where he uses the <code>picture</code>element and media queries to serve the right image.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;picture&gt;\n  &lt;source srcset=\"dark_logo.jpg\" media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" /&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"light_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Homepage\" /&gt;\n&lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/BazoQrz?editors=1100\">Switch images in Dark Mode demo on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>Users change browser or OS settings to improve their experiences for a reason. Please respect these decisions by writing CSS that’s flexible enough to respond to their preferences. Font size, motion, and dark colors settings are only examples, there’s even more to consider like <a href=\"https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2016/12/windows-high-contrast-mode-the-limited-utility-of-ms-high-contrast/\">High Contrast mode</a> on Windows or <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2017/11/os-high-contrast-versus-inverted-colors.html\">inverted colors</a>.</p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<p>Dark Mode is a fantastic example for a feature that's <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos//\">essential for some and useful for all</a>.

    "title": "The lang attribute: browsers telling lies, telling sweet little lies",
    "partialText": "<p>The <code>lang</code> attribute is an essential component in the basic structure of an HTML document. It’s important that we define it correctly because it affects many aspects of user experience. Unfortunately, the negative effects a missing or wrong attribute can have aren’t always evident. Austrian news site <a href=\"http://orf.at\">orf.at</a> learned that the hard way recently.</p><p>Applied to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, the <code>lang</code> attribute defines the natural language of a page. If your document is written in French, you would set it to <em>fr.</em></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;html lang=\"fr\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    …\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    …\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Search engines, screen readers, browser extensions, and other software use this information.</p>\n<h2>Why is the lang attribute so important?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aardrian\">Adrian Roselli</a> wrote about the <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2015/01/on-use-of-lang-attribute.html\">Use of the Lang Attribute</a>, so I will not repeat everything he says but I’ll give you some examples of how this attribute influences UX, and I will show you what happened recently on the most popular Austrian website in Austria.</p>\n<h3>Auto-translation</h3>\n<p>Translation tools like Google Translate may offer to translate contents of a page if the language defined in the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is not the same as the default language in the browser. It seems it doesn’t matter in which language the page is actually written, what counts for Google Translate is the value of the <code>lang</code> attribute. In the following example, Chrome gives me the option to translate the Croatian text on the page, which isn’t Croatian, to English because I set <code>lang</code> to <code>hr</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000/v1603086165/articles/croatian.png\" alt=\"Google Translate prompt offering to translate Croatian which is actually English to English\" /></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"hr\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    …\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>That makes sense and in principle it’s a useful feature but it can be problematic, if translations are not desired:</p>\n<p>Vienna went to the polls this month to elect a (new) municipal government and <a href=\"https://orf.at\">orf.at</a> published the results on their website. They split the results by district, from the 1st district “Innere Stadt” to the 23rd district “Liesing”. Soon after they’ve published the results, they received bug reports from users stating that some names of districts where wrong. When they tried to reproduce the bug, they noticed that Chrome offered to translate the page. If you just close the prompt, nothing happens, but if in the past you <a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000/v1603086165/articles/croatian2.png\">let Google Translate translate pages automatically</a>, it wouldn’t ask anymore but automatically just translate the page.</p>\n<p>The page was written in German but the natural language of the page was set to English in HTML (<code>en</code>), and that’s why Chrome users who instructed the browser to translate English to German automatically saw this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp3mem7or/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000/v1603086166/articles/luegen.jpg\" alt=\"A list of districts on orf.at. Instead of Liesing some users so Lügen\" /></p>\n<p>Google Translate changed the name of the 23rd district “Liesing” to “Lügen” (<em>to lie</em> in English) and the name of the 10th district from “Simmering” to “Sieden” (<em>to simmer</em> in English). Google Translate assumed that the authors meant to write \"lying\" (<span lang=\"de\">lügen</span> in German) and that \"Simmering\" isn’t just a name but the act of cooking liquids.</p>\n<h4>How did it happen?</h4>\n<p>First, I have that to say that it’s not a big deal. I’m just writing about it because it’s an interesting side effect of an issue that usually affects accessibility and not user experience in general.</p>\n<p>I know some devs at <a href=\"http://orf.at\">orf.at</a> and I also know that they care about quality and accessibility, so why did that still happen? Of course, because we’re all human and shit happens, but the specific problem on <a href=\"http://orf.at\">orf.at</a> was that they’re using <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli\">vue-cli</a>, which automatically creates a boilerplate structure for documents that sets the <code>lang</code> attribute to <code>en</code> by default. The devs didn’t notice it because validators and automatic accessibility testing tools just check if the attribute is present and the value valid.</p>\n<h4>Preventing this bug</h4>\n<p>So, it’s a bug that’s hard to spot, but how can we prevent it?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Frameworks and other setups that offer a boilerplate HTML structure could make picking the natural language part of the automatic or manual installation process instead of setting a default. The devs at <a href=\"http://orf.at\">orf.at</a> already created an <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/5945\">issue for vue-cli</a>.</li>\n<li>The documentation should include a section about the HTML document structure and explain why certain things are important and which side effects a wrong implementation can have.</li>\n<li>You could use something like <a href=\"https://ffoodd.github.io/a11y.css/\">a11y.css</a> to debug your document or create your own debug.css and add tests you want to run in your development environment. “Tests” sounds fancy, but it’s just a bunch of selectors that show a big red border or other visual indicators, if there’s an error.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Debugging the lang attribute</h4>\n<p>There are several things you can check.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is a <code>lang</code> attribute present? If not, show a red dotted border.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html:not([lang]) {\n  border: 10px dotted red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>You could even display an error message.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html:not([lang])::before {\n  content: 'lang attribute missing';\n  display: inline-block;\n  background: red;\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  padding: 0.3em;\n  color: #fff;\n  font-size: 1.2rem;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/project/editor/AqPqmJ#0\">Missing lang attribute demo on CodePen</a></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Is a lang attribute present but the value empty?</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html[lang=''],\nhtml[lang*=' '] {\n  border: 10px dotted red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/project/editor/AgGLRa\">Empty lang attribute demo on CodePen</a></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Does the lang attribute contain the correct value?</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html:not(:lang(en)) {\n  border: 10px dotted red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/project/editor/DNabgn\">Wrong value in lang attribute demo on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>What’s great about using the <code>lang()</code> pseudo class is that this test will work even if the value is <code>en-US</code> or <code>en-GB</code>, <abbr title=\"et cetera\">etc</abbr>.</p>\n<p>Note: That won’t work on multilingual websites and you’ll have to adjust it for every project depending on the language.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Putting it all together:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html:not([lang]),\nhtml:not(:lang(en)),\nhtml[lang=''],\nhtml[lang*=' '] {\n  border: 10px dotted red;\n}\n\nhtml:not([lang])::before,\nhtml[lang='']::before,\nhtml[lang*=' ']::before,\nhtml:not(:lang(en))::before {\n  display: inline-block;\n  background: red;\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  padding: 0.3em;\n  color: #fff;\n  font-size: 1.2rem;\n}\n\nhtml:not(:lang(en))::before {\n  content: 'wrong value for lang attribute';\n}\n\nhtml[lang='']::before,\nhtml[lang*=' ']::before {\n  content: 'lang attribute empty';\n}\n\nhtml:not([lang])::before {\n  content: 'lang attribute missing';\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/project/editor/ZyrVee\">Debugging the lang attribute on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>As already mentioned, the <code>lang</code> attribute doesn’t just affect auto-translation but many other aspects of user experience. Here are two more examples:</p>\n<h3>Screen readers</h3>\n<p>Screen readers, the software people use to read content on a page, may pick a different voice profile according to the value of the <code>lang</code> attribute. If you set it to Russian (<code>ru</code>) but the language of the page is English, it may sound like someone’s talking English with a heavy Russian accent.</p>\n<p>Steve Faulkner recorded a demo to show you the effects.</p>\n<div class=\"content__video-wrapper\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" title=\"Effect of lang attribute values on JAWS speech\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0uzxu9dQnuU\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n<h3>Quotation marks</h3>\n<p>Quotation marks may change depending on the the natural language of the page.</p>\n<p>Quotation marks on an English page look like this:</p>\n<style>\n  .contentdemoquote {\n    margin-bottom: 3rem !important;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  .contentdemoquote::before {\n    display: none;\n    transform: none !important;\n    border: none !important;\n    width: auto !important;\n    height: auto !important;\n    position: static !important;\n  }\n  .contentdemoquote::before {\n    content: open-quote  !important;\n    display: inline;\n  }\n  .contentdemoquote::after {\n    content: close-quote;\n  }\n</style>\n<blockquote class=\"contentdemoquote\" lang=\"en\">\n  Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    …\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>German:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"contentdemoquote\" lang=\"de\">\n  Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;html lang=\"de\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    …\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>French:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"contentdemoquote\" lang=\"fr\">\n  Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;html lang=\"fr\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    …\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote&gt;Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You can learn more about quotation marks in CSS in <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know-about-content/\">Here’s what I didn’t know about “content”</a>.</p>\n<h3>Others</h3>\n<p>The correct usage of the value also may affect hyphenation, <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> compliance, input fields, spell checking and the default font selection for CJK languages (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean).

It kinda has some structure, but I guess you could describe it as pretty arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Here’s a random class from the current HTMHell website.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.site-intro {\n  font-size: 2rem;\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: 700;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n  max-width: 36ch;\n  margin-left: auto;\n  margin-right: auto;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo/status/1345815183680270340\">a poll I ran on Twitter</a>, most people order by type, closely followed by alphabetical ordering. I also did a quick search and, as expected, many people have thought and written about different approaches and the pros and cons compared to others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-how-do-you-order-your-css-properties/\">Poll Results: How do you order your CSS properties?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/outside-in-ordering-css-properties-by-importance--cms-21685\">“Outside In” — Ordering CSS Properties by Importance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://9elements.com/css-rule-order/\">How to organize CSS @ 9elements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@jerrylowm/alphabetize-your-css-properties-for-crying-out-loud-780eb1852153\">Alphabetize your CSS properties, for crying out loud</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/thekashey/happy-potter-and-the-order-of-css-5ec\">Harry Potter and the Order of CSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meiert.com/en/blog/on-declaration-sorting/\">On Declaration Sorting in CSS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>My new approach</h2>\n<p>Since I don’t have a strong opinion on the topic and I haven’t tried different techniques, I will not repeat what others have done already, I’ll just share how I’ll try to write CSS on the new HTMHell website. Switching to a completely new system feels a bit too radical, so I decided to refine and structure my current approach.</p>\n<p>I’m against grouping all properties, because it’s hard to group all of them sensibly and it’s hard to remember later which properties go together. I’m also against ordering alphabetically because I want <code>bottom</code> and <code>right</code> close to <code>position</code> and <code>align-items</code> close to <code>display</code>. I want strict ordering for properties I use a lot and a loose but structured ordering for the rest. I work my way from the outside in, from the back to the front.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Box model properties</strong><br />\n(<code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>min-/max-width</code>, <code>min-/max-height</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>)</li>\n<li><strong>Background</strong><br />\n(<code>background-image</code>, <code>background-size</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Layout</strong><br />\n(<code>display</code>, <code>position</code>, <code>justify-content</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>align-items</code>, <code>align-content</code>, <code>grid-gap</code>, <code>grid-template-columns</code>, <code>flex-wrap</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Typography</strong><br />\n(<code>font-size</code>, <code>font-style</code>, <code>font-family</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>line-height</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code>, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Everything else</strong>, in alphabetical order</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here’s an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  /* box model */\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 2rem 1rem;\n  min-height: 100vh;\n\n  /* background */\n  background-image: url(../img/bg.png);\n\n  /* layout  */\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n\n  /* type */\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n  font-size: 1.2rem;\n  line-height: 1.7;\n  color: var(--color-text);\n\n  /* other, in alphabetical order */\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 2px #000;\n  transition: all 0.3s;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>If I notice that I’m using a property from the 5th group a lot, I might promote it to one of the other groups. Grouping and sorting is probably unnecessary on such a small site like the one I’m working on right now, but it’s an interesting exercise. If It works here, I might try it at work on a larger project with more people involved. If not, I’ll just keep doing whatever feels right to me. 🙃</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9COrdering+CSS+properties%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

The author adds a class to the <code>col</code> element, which does nothing with the <code>col</code> element itself, at least not visually, because the element doesn’t get rendered on the page, but it applies the styles from the class to all the cells in the column.<br />\nWhy is this interesting? Well, there are no columns in HTML tables, only rows and cells and the <code>col</code> element allows us to style columns anyway.</p>\n<style>\n   .heading-table {\n      border-collapse: collapse;\n

The <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/markup#top-elements\">div is by far the most popular element</a>, which is absolutely fine, but it's often being used in favor of other elements that would fit better. This overuse is nothing new, but the rise of JavaScript (JS) frameworks has amplified it.\n</p>\n<p>It would be a bit too easy to only blame JS frameworks, there are several reasons we use <code>div</code>s so much:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#elements\">Poor knowledge of HTML elements</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#why\">Lack of understanding why</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#css\">Insufficient CSS skills</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#defaultstyles\">Default styles</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#frameworks\">JS frameworks</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#thepage\"> We don't care enough about <em>the page</em></a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#style\">Some elements are hard to style</a>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"elements\">Poor knowledge of HTML elements</h2>\n<p>\n  It's hard to use something you don't know exists. As someone who teaches HTML, I know that universities don't put enough emphasis on teaching semantic HTML. They teach syntax, basic structure and the ~20 most important elements and attributes, and that's pretty much it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Did you know that there are 112 elements in HTML? <a href=\"twitter.com/plfstr\">Paul Foster</a> built this fantastic <a href=\"https://codepen.io/plfstr/full/zYqQeRw\">HTML memory test</a>. Try it, you'll be surprised how much you don't remember and know. (Heads up: His test lists 115 elements because it includes <code>svg</code>, <code>math</code>, and the deprecated <code>rb</code> element.)\n</p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"400\" data-slug-hash=\"zYqQeRw\" data-user=\"plfstr\" style=\"height: 400px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/plfstr/pen/zYqQeRw\">\n  HTML Tags Memory Test</a> by Paul (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/plfstr\">@plfstr</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"why\">Lack of understanding why</h2>\n<p>\n  Having spoken with many developers at workshops, meetups, and conferences, I believe that most know that semantic HTML is important, but only a few know why.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <q>For accessibility! Duh!</q>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Of course, for accessibility, but most people don't know why you need a <a href=\"https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/the-document-outline/\">sound document outline</a> or landmarks, or what the advantages of a <code>button</code> button over a <code>div</code> button are. If I don't know which consequences my choices have on users, why would I bother using <a href=\"https://htmhell.dev/18-main-divigation/\">anything else but the div</a>?\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"frameworks\">JS frameworks</h2>\n<p>\n  Some JavaScript frameworks require that you wrap components in a single element. If no semantic element fits, devs use the <code>div</code>. I believe they got used to the <code>div</code> so much that they began using it all the time. It's common to see invalid code like this:\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n  The number of wrapper divs can be reduced, though, because most frameworks don't require you anymore to wrap your components in HTML elements. <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html\">React supports fragments</a>, wrapper elements that don't add extra nodes to the DOM, and <a href=\"https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/fragments.html#overview\">Vue supports multi-root components</a> in version 3.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"css\">\n  Insufficient CSS skills\n</h2>\n<p>\n  A pattern I've noticed among students who start my beginner HTML and CSS course with previous knowledge of HTML is that they wrap almost everything in a <code>div</code>. When I ask them why, they usually say that they're adding them in case they might need them later. I know CSS pretty well and usually when I look at a design, I can tell if I will need extra elements for styling. Even if I miss something, it's much better to add some <code>div</code>s later than wrapping everything preemptively. Pro tip: Start with pen and paper and sketch out the structure of your site before you write a line of code. I usually use a combination of drawing boxes and writing Emmet pseudo code. If you make mistakes, you're making them on paper, which is easier to fix than changing actual code later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  By the way, you can get pretty far without using a single <code>div</code>. Just take a look at the source code of <a href=\"https://www.erikkroes.nl/\">Erik’s</a> website.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"defaultstyles\">\n  Default styles\n</h2>\n<blockquote>\n  divs are so much easier to style than buttons.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  That might have been true in the past, but it's not anymore. Here's what you need to remove the default styles of a button.\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">button {\n  all: initial;\n}</code></pre>\n<button type=\"button\" style=\"all:initial\" onclick=\"alert('Yes, that’s a button.')\">Look mum, no styles.</button>\n<p>If you want to reset everything, but inherit font styling, you need 2 more lines.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">button {\n  all: initial;\n  font: inherit;\n  color: inherit;\n}</code></pre>\n<button type=\"button\" style=\"all:initial; font: inherit; color: inherit\" onclick=\"alert('Yes, that’s a button.')\">Look mum, no styles.</button>\n<h2 id=\"thepage\">\n  We don't care enough about <em>the page</em>\n</h2>\n<p>\n  Many devs don't build pages anymore, they build components. I do that, too, because it makes sense as soon as your site reaches a certain level of complexity. Also, frameworks and pattern libraries think in terms of components which kind of forces you to do that, too.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The problem with working on small pieces is that it's easy to ignore the big picture. We can conceive, design, and develop components, but the end results for users is usually a whole page. A component with 2 or 3 <code>div</code>s might not look bad, but if I nest it in 5 other components, I might end up with 15 <code>div</code>s that don't do anything but increase complexity and file size.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"style\">Some elements are hard to style</h2>\n<p>Yes, some elements are hard to style. To make our designers or customers happy, we don't use the default <code>select</code> element, but we write a complex component that consists of a bunch of divs with aria roles and a lot of JS. Sometimes have to do that, but sometimes it's better to just live with the fact that you can't style <code>option</code> elements and use the native component that comes with all the functionality and accessibility by default.</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n<h2>So?! What's the point of this post?</h2>\n<p>Honestly, I don’t know. I started writing and here we are. I guess I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head. If there’s one thing you can take away from this post, it’s that while HTML might not be the most complex frontend language, it’s the most important language with the biggest impact on users. Learning how to write HTML is not as hard as learning to write JavaScript, but learning how to write it in a way that it best possibly benefits users also takes time. The least we can do is to familiarize ourselves properly with the <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#semantics\">elements and attributes</a> it provides us with.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CElement+diversity%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>2021 was wild! That’s why I’ve decided to write an “A year in review” post for the first time.</p><h2>Personal</h2>\n<p>Let me start with the most important thing that happened in 2021: Our daughter Johanna was born on May 19th. I can’t describe how beautiful the entire experience was and still is. For the first two days, I wasn’t able to look at her for longer than 5 seconds without tearing up. Everything was just so emotional, beautiful, and overwhelming.</p>\n<img alt=\"My fiance, me and 1 month old Johanna in front of a sunrise\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/a-year-in-review/3052307839-1698841493/baby.jpg\">\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, life with a baby is exhausting, especially compared to how our life was before, but the positive things outweigh the lack of sleep and the new fears you have as a parent. Watching her grow and learn new stuff every day is amazing.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: I hid some Easter eggs on HTMHell regarding my daughter. The example I’m using in <a href=\"https://www.htmhell.dev/tips/iframe-accessibility/\">Issue #1 - iframe accessibility</a> is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwuCF5lYqEE\">“Visions of Johanna” by Bob Dylan</a> and I’ve listed her as an executive producer in the credits of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52eL1CCJdi8\">my first YouTube video</a>.  </p>\n<p>Another personal highlight of 2021 was our first vacation as a family in Croatia. We enjoyed the time at the sea and camping in our van a lot!</p>\n<img alt=\"My fiance, me and 1 month old Johanna in front of a sunrise\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/a-year-in-review/669a89e90b-1698841493/baby_urlaub.jpg\">\n<h3>Conclusion personal</h3>\n<p>My personal year 2021 was overall great. I’m getting tired of the whole pandemic situation, but my fiance and I enjoyed the time she was pregnant a lot and the rest of the year as well, of course. I was always bad at work-life-balance and this year it has changed little. While I could keep most weekends work-free and I spent them with my fiance and my daughter, I didn’t have enough time and energy left for the rest of my family and my friends.</p>\n<h2>Work</h2>\n<h3>Angular and performance</h3>\n<p>In the first few months, I worked with a team of Angular devs on improving the performance of a large all-in-one productivity app. The job was challenging because most people involved were very skilled and I felt a lot of pressure to deliver visible improvements every week, but I learned a lot in these few weeks and I got to know super nice people. It was a joy to work with them.</p>\n<h3>Cats</h3>\n<p>I worked a lot with the Smashing Magazine team, which is a great honor to me because I’ve been a fan of Smashing Magazine and their work for many years. I became part of their <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/about/#smashing-magazine-s-experts-panel\">experts panel</a>, I <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/9087993/video/654497457\">gave a talk at a meetup</a> and I held a <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/manuel-matuzovic-apr/\">workshop</a>.</p>\n<h3>The City</h3>\n<p>At my day job nothing too exceptional happened. This sounds negative, but it’s actually a good thing because we had time to focus on our new design system and the pattern library. One thing worth mentioning is that I worked quite a lot with <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/\">CraftCMS</a> and twig. I like Craft because it gives me as a frontend developer a lot of freedom to build templates the way I want.</p>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<p>Other than that I did some accessibility audits, consulting for an university in Vienna, and several workshops. My favorite gig was a 2-day workshop with the designers and developers of <a href=\"https://www.sipgate.de/\">sipgate</a>. They were so interested, involved and eager to improve the accessibility of their products that it didn’t feel like work for me. I had a lot of fun and I also learned from them.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion work</h3>\n<p>Considering that I have a full-time job, that sounds like a lot, and it was. All in all, I’m happy with the quality of my work, but I was stressed out a lot this year, and I did fuck-up one or two tasks.</p>\n<h2>Side projects</h2>\n<p>I’m really happy with my side projects. I created some pretty cool and useful stuff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/matuzo/DevToolsSnippets\">DevToolsSnippets</a>, a collection of front-end debugging script snippets to be used in the Sources panel in Chrome DevTools. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buttoncheatsheet.com/\">The Button Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n<li>I started the <a href=\"https://www.htmhell.dev/newsletter/\">HTMHell newsletter</a>.</li>\n<li>I recorded the first video for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52eL1CCJdi8\">HTMHell YouTube channel</a>.</li>\n<li>HTMHell Advent Calendar</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Talks</h2>\n<p>I didn’t take part in many calls for papers, but I prepared a new talk and I presented it at 3 events. You can watch <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/654497457\">“Building The Most Inaccessible Site Possible with Manuel Matuzovic - Smashing Meets For All December 2021”</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/smashingmagazine\">Smashing Magazine</a> on Vimeo.

    "partialText": "<p>This is part 4 of my series <a href=\"/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know/\">Here’s what I didn’t know about…</a> in which I try to learn new things about CSS. This time I'm trying to find out what I didn’t know about the <code>:where()</code> pseudo-class.</p><hr>\n<p>Okay, I’ll be honest. When I heard about the <code>:where()</code> pseudo-class for the first time, I wasn’t impressed because reading a rule like the following hurt my brain. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:where(header, main, footer) p:hover {\n  color: red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>It feels like using a shorthand property instead of longhand properties; fewer lines of code, but harder to process. I didn’t get the point, but a few days ago it clicked. </p>\n<p>Here’s what I didn’t know about <code>:where()</code>:</p>\n<h2>You can use it to lower the specificity of a selector</h2>\n<p>I believe it was on <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/\">Andys</a> blog where I saw this smart rule:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul[class] {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>If a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> has no <code>class</code>, it’s probably a list in the true sense, so leave it untouched and display bullets. If the list has a class, it’s semantically still a list (<a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html\">in most browsers</a>), but it’s likely that it doesn’t look like one, so reset the styling. Yeah, I know, dangerous assumptions, but it worked well for me in the past. The only issue I had with this solution is the high specificity caused by the combination of a tag and a class selector. If I wanted to change one of the default properties using just a <code>class</code> selector, it wouldn’t work.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ul class=\"space\"&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;JS&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul[class] {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n.space {\n  /* This doesn't apply because ul[class]\n   has higher specificity than .space */\n  margin: 2rem;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Open <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/BamayaR\">the first example on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p>This is where <code>:where()</code> comes into play. No matter which selectors you pass to the pseudo-class, <code>:where()</code> will always have a specificity of 0.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">ul:where([class]) {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n.space {\n  /* This applies because .space has higher \n  specificity than ul:where([class]) */\n  margin: 2rem;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Even though the selector contains a tag, a pseudo-class and an attribute, only the tag selector adds to the specificity.</p>\n<p>Open <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/podovex\">the second example on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p>Another great example is input styling (thanks for the tip, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ckirknielsen/status/1484962960632123397\">Christopher</a>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">input:where([type=\"text\"], \n            [type=\"email\"],\n            [type=\"password\"]) {\n  border: 2px solid #000;\n}\n\n[aria-invalid] {\n  border-color: red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>or if you're a fan of the <code>:not()</code> selector:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">input:where(\n  :not(\n    [type=\"button\"], \n    [type=\"reset\"],\n    [type=\"image\"]\n  )\n) {\n  border: 2px solid #000;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Open <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/KKyKwor\">the third example on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<h2><code>:where()</code> is a forgiving selector</h2>\n<p>If a list of selectors contains an invalid selector, none of the selectors will match.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button&gt;\n  Send\n&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* The background color won't change on :hover or :focus\n because the invalid :touch pseudo-class makes the whole\nlist invalid  */\nbutton:focus,\nbutton:hover,\nbutton:touch {\n  background: red;\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  .btn1:focus,\n  .btn1:hover,\n  .btn1:touch {\n    background: red;\n  }\n  .btn2:where(:focus,\n             :hover,\n             :touch) {\n  background: red;\n}\n</style>\n<p><button type=\"button\" class=\"btn1\">\n  Send\n</button></p>\n<p>Open <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/eYeYmLq\">example 4 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p>If you use <code>:where()</code> instead, <code>:focus</code> and <code>:hover</code> will still match.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">button:where(:focus,\n             :hover,\n             :touch) {\n  background: red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p><button type=\"button\" class=\"btn2\">\n  Send\n</button></p>\n<p>Open <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/eYeYNNN\">example 4 on CodePen</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I haven’t used <code>:where()</code> in production yet, but considering that <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_where\">browsers support</a> is pretty great, I’m going to try it out soon. The only concern I still have is the cognitive overload selectors like <code>:where()</code> or <code>:not()</code> create.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CHere%E2%80%99s+what+I+didn%E2%80%99t+know+about+%3Awhere%28%29%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>Earlier this week I learned about <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#layering\">CSS Cascade Layers</a> and now I’m all hyped up because I really like the concept. I’m eager to find out how we can use them to improve and rethink the architecture of our styles.</p><p>I will not explain how CSS Cascade Layers work because Bramus and Stephanie have already done that and they did it much better than I ever could. I just want to get my feet wet and share my first impressions. If you’re new to the topic, read their articles first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/introduction-css-cascade-layers/\">Getting Started With CSS Cascade Layers</a> by Stephanie Eckles</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bram.us/2021/09/15/the-future-of-css-cascade-layers-css-at-layer/\">The Future of CSS: Cascade Layers (CSS @layer)</a> by Bramus van Damme</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I’m writing this blog post, I’m looking at a large site I’ve been working on and I’m trying to find scenarios in which cascade layers could’ve been useful.</p>\n<h2>Overly specific base styles</h2>\n<p>If you have a layer for base styles and another for your components, you don’t have to worry about selectors with high specificity in the base layer anymore.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@layer base, components;\n\n@layer base {\n  ul[class] {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    list-style-type: none;\n  }\n\n  input[type=\"text\"] {\n    border: 1px solid #000;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  .nav {\n    margin-left: 40px;\n  }\n\n  .error {\n    border: 2px dashed #F00;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Rules in <code>.nav</code> and <code>.error</code> overwrite rules in <code>ul[class]</code> and <code>input[type=\"text\"]</code> even though the specificity of the latter is higher.</p>\n<p>Try it yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/mdqJqGo\">“Base Styles with Cascade Layers” on CodePen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/LYOVOqB\">“Base Styles without Cascade Layers” on CodePen</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hint: You have to enable support for Cascade Layers in your browser, they’re still <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/css-cascade-layers\">behind a flag</a>.</p>\n<h2>Third party styles</h2>\n<p>One of the third-party tools we’re using uses highly specific selectors. In some places we’re overwriting rules and we either have to use selectors with the same specificity 🤢 or <code>!important</code> 🤮.</p>\n<p>I imagine having a dedicated layer for third party styles could make sense. Within this layer, you nest other layers, one or more for the styles you import and another one for your custom overwrites.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@layer base, third-party, components;\n\n@layer base {\n  /* Base styles */\n}\n\n@layer third-party {\n  @layer slider {\n    .slider.slider-horizontal &gt; .slider-item {\n      background: #fefefe;\n      padding: 10px;\n      border: 1px solid #000;\n    }\n  }\n  /* \n    In reality 3rd party styles would probabaly live in separate files\n    @import url(slider.css) layer(third-party); \n  */\n\n  @layer overwrites {\n    .slider-item {\n      border-color: #F00;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  /* Component styles */\n}</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/NWwqwVx\">“3rd party styles with Cascade Layers” on CodePen</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Utility classes</h2>\n<p>Having a dedicated layer for utility classes feels way more intuitive than having to apply <code>!important</code> to each rule in a utility class.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ul id=\"list\" class=\"u-df\"&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;One&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Two&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Three&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@layer base, components, utility;\n\n@layer base {\n  /* Base styles */\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  #list {\n    display: block;\n    list-style-type: none;\n    padding: 0;\n  }\n}\n\n\n@layer utility {\n  .u-df {\n    display: flex;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/JjOdMKe\">“Utility classes with Cascade Layers” on CodePen</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This all makes sense to me in theory, but I guess we’ll see how useful layers will be in reality once support gets better and more people begin experimenting. Either way, I’m really stoked about the progress happening with layers and new selectors like <code>:is()</code> and <a href=\"/blog/2022/heres-what-i-didnt-know-about-where/\">:where()</a>. Super useful stuff that will make the lives of those specialized in CSS easier. I don’t believe that it will make everyone’s lives easier because with features like these CSS becomes more powerful, but this also increases its complexity. Mastering CSS is already pretty hard, but it will take even more in the future to become really good at writing CSS.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CCascade+Layers%3A+First+Contact%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>I decided to learn more about areas of web development I don’t know a lot about. You know,…stuff like SEO and web security. I’ll share my findings here on my blog and I’ll try to do as much research as possible, but please keep in mind that I’m a noob concerning these topics.</p><p>I began watching <a href=\"https://feross.org/\">Feross Aboukhadijeh</a>’s fantastic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JJrJGZ_LjM&amp;list=PL1y1iaEtjSYiiSGVlL1cHsXN_kvJOOhu-&amp;index=1\">Web Security lecture</a>, which inspired me to learn more about web security. This first post is about Cross Site Scripting (XSS). </p>\n<h2>XSS</h2>\n<p>XSS describes the practice of injecting malicious code into an otherwise trusted website, or, in other words, injecting JavaScript into an HTML document. The point of XSS is that the attacker can execute JavaScript on a page by supplying untrusted data and do stuff they otherwise wouldn’t be able to do. For example, reading users’ cookies and sending HTTP requests with these cookies.</p>\n<p>There are two types of XSS attacks: server and client XSS.</p>\n<h3>Server XSS</h3>\n<p>Server XSS occurs when the vulnerability is in the server-side code and the browser renders and executes the HTTP response generated by the server, which includes the user supplied untrusted data. For example, this can happen when a hacker exploits the comment field in a blog post by using it to save JavaScript in the database. This JavaScript code then runs every time anyone opens the page with the “comment”.</p>\n<h3>Client XSS</h3>\n<p>Client XSS occurs when the vulnerability is in the client-side code and untrusted user supplied data is used to update the DOM (Document Object Model) with an unsafe JavaScript call. For example, hackers could send out links with malicious <code>GET</code> parameters that inject JavaScript into the DOM when the user opens the link.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the different types of XSS and more detailed definitions on the <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting\">owasp - Types of XSS</a> page.</p>\n<h2>Hack the Planet!</h2>\n<p>Okay, now let me show how this may look like in practice.</p>\n<h3>A simple PHP search form</h3>\n<p>Let’s say we have a form that allows users to search for a custom term.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;form role=\"search\" method=\"GET\"&gt;\n  &lt;label for=\"term\"&gt;Search term&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"term\" name=\"q\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;button&gt;search&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<img alt=\"A input field labelled &ldquo;Search term&rdquo; and a search button.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/web-security-basics-xss/34ed16ce46-1698950563/sec1_demo1_1.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n<p>When the user enters a term and submits the form, we show the results and a message that says “Showing results for [TERM]”.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">&lt;?php \n  if (isset($_GET['q'])):\n      echo \"&lt;p&gt;Showing results for “&lt;mark class=\\\"term\\\"&gt;\".$_GET['q'].\"&lt;/mark&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\";\n?&gt;\n  &lt;ol&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Result 1&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Result 2&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Result 3&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;</code></pre>\n<img alt=\"A Search form that has been submitted showing some dummy results for the term &ldquo;flowers&rdquo;.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/web-security-basics-xss/efb49a52c5-1698950563/sec1_demo1_2.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n<p>Since we’re using the <code>GET</code> method, the URL changes <code>/search?q=flowers</code>, too.

The browser tries to load <code>idontexist.jpg</code>, but fails because the image doesn't exist on the server. This triggers the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onerror\">onerror event</a> which fires when a resource fails to load.

I suggest you read the <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#xss-prevention-rules\">XSS Prevention Rules</a> on the owasp website. Most importantly, you should control where users can enter data and you should escape/HTML encode the data. This means turning critical characters like <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>,<code>\"</code>, and <code>'</code> into entities. You can use a package like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/escape-html\">escape-html</a> for that.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;script type=\"module\"&gt;\n  import { escapeHtml } from './escape-html.mjs';\n\n  let params = (new URL(document.location)).searchParams;\n  let q = params.get('q');\n\n  if (q) {\n    document.querySelector('[data-results]').removeAttribute('hidden')\n    document.querySelector('input').value = q\n    document.querySelector('.term').innerHTML = escapeHtml(q)\n  }\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<img alt=\"A input field labelled &ldquo;Search term&rdquo; and a search button.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/web-security-basics-xss/1f068824b4-1698950563/sec1_demo2_3.jpg\" width=\"710\">\n<p>Try it yourself in the <a href=\"https://matuzo-test1.netlify.app/search2?q=%3Cimg+src%3D%22idontexist.jpg%22+onerror%3D%22alert%28%27Acid+Burn+was+here%27%29%22%3E\">search form with escaped content demo</a>.</p>\n<h2>Alerta Alerta</h2>\n<p>Most examples of XSS you find online use <code>alert()</code> to demonstrate vulnerabilities. You can’t do much harm with <code>alert()</code>, it’s just a nice way of showing that JavaScript can be injected. There are other dangerous methods you can execute, though. I’ll show you in the next blog post how XSS can be used to steal cookies.</p>\n<p>As already mentioned, I'm pretty new to this topic.

    "title": "Analyzing pages in a particular state with Lighthouse",
    "partialText": "<p>Historically, Lighthouse has analyzed the cold pageload of a page only. Clicking the “Generate report” button reloads the page before Lighthouse runs its tests. This can be problematic when you want to run tests on parts of the UI that are only visible when the user interacts with it. For example, a fly-out navigation, a modal window, or the content in a disclosure widget.</p><p>That has changed with Lighthouse v10. A new <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-103/#lighthouse\">experimental feature in Chrome DevTools</a> allows us now to analyze the page in a particular state. Here’s an example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/images/lh-snapshot1.webp\"></p>\n<img alt=\"Browser screenshot.

First, you have to enable this feature because it’s still an experiment: Open Chrome DevTools, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, click “Experiments”, and tick the checkbox “Use Lighthouse panel with timespan and snapshot modes”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/images/lh-snapshot4.webp\"></p>\n<img alt=\"The experiments page in Chrome Dev Tools with the timespan and snapshot modes option highlighted.\" height=\"484\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/lighthouse-snapshot/7ce0ae81b4-1698950570/lh-snapshot4.webp\" width=\"751\">\n</a>\n<p>Now Reload Chrome DevTools and open Lighthouse again.

Instead of a score, it now shows how many tests of the total number of applicable tests the page has passed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/images/lh-snapshot6.webp\"></p>\n<img alt=\"Lighthouse, after it ran in snapshot mode, showing that 9 of 10 tests have passed.

    "title": "Buttons and the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon",
    "partialText": "<p>Shortly after we got our new car, a Volkswagen T5, I noticed many people seemed to have the same car. Actually, it was everywhere.</p><p>It felt like everyone had the same car. While sales of camping vans and cars that can be used for camping in fact have increased during the pandemic, there’s another reason I saw so many of them, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion\">Frequency illusion or Baader–Meinhof phenomenon</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>The Frequency illusion, also known as the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon or frequency bias, is a cognitive bias in which, after noticing something for the first time, there is a tendency to notice it more often, leading someone to believe that it has an increased frequency of occurrence.</blockquote></div>\n<p>Shortly after I started <a href=\"https://www.htmhell.dev/\">HTMHell</a> a similar thing happened. Every other website seemed to have inaccessible buttons. While this can be explained by the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, there’s actually data that confirms my feeling. According to the <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/#errors\">WebAim 1 Million report</a>, 50.1% of 1 million tested websites contained empty links and 27.2% empty buttons. </p>\n<p>So, it was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOILAZHf2pE\">more than a feeling</a>. We are terrible at labelling buttons. I understand that this can be confusing, because there are many different ways of getting the job done.<br />\nTo help with that issue, I've collected different correct and wrong ways of labelling buttons:</p>\n<h2>How to label buttons</h2>\n<style>\n  button {\n    border: 2px solid #153a51;\n    background-color: #fff;\n    font-family: inherit;\n    font-size: 1.3rem;\n    padding: 0.3em 0.6em;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    display: flex;\n    gap: 0.5rem;\n  }\n  .post  button img {\n    border: none;\n  }\n  button:where(:hover, :focus) {\n    background-color: hsl(186, 56%, 48%);\n    color: #fff;\n  }\n</style>\n<h3>Text only</h3>\n<p>The all-time classic “just using visible text” works for everyone.</p>\n<p><button type=\"button\">Tweet!</button></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;Tweet!&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Text and Icon</h3>\n<p>It’s absolutely fine if you want to add an image or icon to the button. Just make sure to hide it from assistive technology using <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code>. The text label of the button should be sufficient, we don’t need extra information.</p>\n<p>\n<button type=\"button\">\n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\">\n    <use href=\"#twitter\"></use>\n  </svg>\n  Tweet!\n</button>\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;svg aria-hidden=\"true\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\"&gt;\n    &lt;use href=\"#twitter\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n\n  Tweet!\n&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Sometimes you want to use an icon only. First, you should be really sure that people understand the purpose of the button without text, and second, label it properly. Just because there’s no text visible on screen doesn’t mean that there doesn’t have to be text in the document.<br />\nThere are different ways of creating icon-only buttons.  </p>\n<h3>Icon-only using a sr-only class</h3>\n<p>You can put text inside the button and hide it visually using a custom class.</p>\n<p>\n<button type=\"button\">\n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\">\n    <use href=\"#twitter\"></use>\n  </svg>\n  <span class=\"u-vh\">Tweet!</span>\n</button>\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"sr-only\"&gt;Tweet!&lt;/span&gt;\n\n  &lt;svg aria-hidden=\"true\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\"&gt;\n    &lt;use href=\"#twitter\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.sr-only {\n  border: 0;\n  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);\n  clip-path: inset(50%);\n  height: 1px;\n  left: 0;\n  margin: -1px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  padding: 0;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  width: 1px;\n}</code></pre>\n<h3>Icon-only using aria-label on the button</h3>\n<p>You can add a text alternative for the icon using <code>aria-label</code> on the button.</p>\n<p>\n<button aria-label=\"Tweet!\" type=\"button\">\n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\">\n    <use href=\"#twitter\"></use>\n  </svg>\n</button>\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button aria-label=\"Tweet!\" type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;svg aria-hidden=\"true\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\"&gt;\n    &lt;use href=\"#twitter\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Icon-only using aria-labelledby on the button</h3>\n<p>If the label you want to use already exists somewhere on the page, you can reference it using <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heading\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"font-size: 1.5rem\">Tweet!</h2>\n<p>\n<button aria-labelledby=\"heading\" type=\"button\">\n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\">\n    <use href=\"#twitter\"></use>\n  </svg>\n</button>\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;h2 id=\"heading\"&gt;Tweet!&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;button aria-labelledby=\"heading\" type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;svg aria-hidden=\"true\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\"&gt;\n    &lt;use href=\"#twitter\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Icon-only using title inside the svg</h3>\n<p>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element inside the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> can serve as the accessible name for the button. Unfortunately, in order for this to work properly with all screen readers and browsers, you have to label the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> using <code>aria-labelledby</code> explicitly.</p>\n<p>\n<button type=\"button\">\n  <svg aria-labelledby=\"title_twitter_h72d\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\">\n    <title id=\"title_twitter_h72d\">Tweet!</title>\n    <use href=\"#twitter\"></use>\n  </svg>\n</button>\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;svg aria-labelledby=\"title_twitter_h72d\" width=\"28\" height=\"28\"&gt;\n    &lt;title id=\"title_twitter_h72d\"&gt;Tweet!&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;use href=\"#twitter\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Icon-only using alt attribute</h3>\n<p>If you’re using an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element instead of <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>, then the <code>alt</code> attribute serves as the accessible name of the button.</p>\n<p>\n<button type=\"button\">\n  <img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/button-baader/6ed255792d-1698950567/twitter.png\" width=\"28 alt=Tweet!\">\n</button>  \n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"/images/twitter.png\" alt=\"Tweet!\" width=\"28\"&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;  </code></pre>\n<h3>Icon-only using background-image</h3>\n<p>If you’re using a background image, the best option is to add visually hidden text to the button. <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code> would work, too.</p>\n<style>\n  .bgimg {\n    background: url(/blog/2022/button-baader/twitter.png);\n    width: 3.57rem;\n    height: 2.8rem;\n    background-size: 56%;\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-position: center;\n  }\n</style>\n<p>\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"bgimg\">\n  <span class=\"u-vh\">Tweet!</span>\n</button>  \n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button type=\"button\"&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"sr-only\"&gt;Tweet!&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/button&gt;  </code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">button {\n  background: url(/images/twitter.png) no-repeat center;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>How not to label buttons</h2>\n<p>Here are some of the wrong solutions I see often.

Okay, let's have a look at the rules to get an idea of what could've caused this ban. You break the rules if your tweets contain content related to anything in this list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Violence</li>\n<li>Terrorism/violent extremism</li>\n<li>Child sexual exploitation</li>\n<li>Abuse/harassment</li>\n<li>Hateful conduct</li>\n<li>Perpetrators of violent attacks</li>\n<li>Suicide or self-harm</li>\n<li>Sensitive media, including graphic violence and adult content</li>\n<li>Illegal or certain regulated goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can assure you I tweeted nothing related to any of these things. Also, I didn't spam, I didn't try to manipulate elections, I didn't impersonate anyone, I didn't share synthetic or manipulated media, and I did not violate others’ intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>So, what happened? I have absolutely no idea! Here's a rough outline of the events:</p>\n<style>\n  ol li + li {\n    margin-top: 1.5rem;\n  }\n</style>\n<ol>\n<li>\n  <p><strong>21.10.

I told them that I got shadowbanned for no reason and I asked them to look into the matter.   \n  Being shadowbanned means that I can still like, comment, and tweet, but people don't see my content. Also, people can't search for my content on Twitter. For me, everything looks fine, but in reality I'm not reaching anyone.

    "partialText": "<p>When I wrote about the <a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day20/\">scrollbar-gutter property</a>, my first thought was “omg! I'll put this in my reset stylesheet and use it on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> by default”. I wanted to do that in order to prevent the page from “jumping” when switching from a long to a short page, a page with overflow to one without.</p><p>Here's a quick demo to illustrate the issue. </p>\n<figure>\n<figure class=\"video\"><video controls><source src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/100daysof-day25/73a311c520-1698950570/scrollbar-gutter.mov\" type=\"video/quicktime\"></video></figure>\n<figcaption>When switching from a page with a scrollbar to a page without, you can see how the whole page shifts to the left because the scrollbar takes up space on longer pages.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So I tried this…</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  scrollbar-gutter: stable;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>…and it didn't work.</p>\n<p>I looked at the spec and there it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\nHowever, unlike the overflow property, the user agent must not propagate scrollbar-gutter from the HTML body element.\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, <code>overflow</code> on the <code>body</code> is propagated to the viewport, which absolutely makes sense. Just try to set a width on the body with a lot of content, you'll see how the width changes, but the scrollbar is still on the inline end of the viewport.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/100daysof-day25/b7fdebf44f-1698950568/scrollbar-gutter1.png\">\n<p>If I understand correctly, <code>scrollbar-gutter</code> has no effect on the body because <code>overflow</code> is propagated to the viewport, but <code>scrollbar-gutter</code> isn't. If there's no overflow, then there's no scrollbar gutter. It kinda makes sense to me. (Please correct me if I'm wrong. :))</p>\n<p>When I moved the declaration to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, it worked! That's because both <code>overflow</code> and <code>scrollbar-gutter</code> used on <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> are propagated to the viewport.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html {\n  scrollbar-gutter: stable;\n}</code></pre><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+25%3A+scrollbar+gutters+in+body+and+html%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>On October 23rd I got <a href=\"/blog/2022/twitter-ban/\">shadowbanned on Twitter</a>, followed by a permanent suspension on October 25th. As someone who was very active on Twitter, I was surprised, shocked, and sad that this happened. Especially because I didn’t know why it happened.</p><img alt=\"Screenshot of parts of my Twitter profile that says: Your account is permanently banned. After careful review, we determined you account broke the Twitter Rules. Your account is permanently in read-only mode, which means you can&#039;t Tweet, Retweet, or Like content. You won&#039;t be able to create new accounts. If you think we got this wrong, you can submit an appeal.\" height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/your-account-is-permanently-suspended/fe6ae352d9-1698950569/twitter_ban.jpg\" width=\"726\">\n<p>Some of you might think, <em>“Who cares, it’s just social media?!”</em>, and yeah, you’re right, it is just social media, but it was a pretty big deal. For me personally, I’ll go into detail about why later in this post, and generally because I got suspended without a clue why and with no notice. That’s something that shouldn’t happen on one of the biggest social media sites worldwide.<br />\nThis whole incident got many people thinking, and it started some interesting discussions. Most people were in disbelief at how someone who mostly posts harmless web dev related content could get suspended out of nowhere. Many talked about the importance of owning your content and the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">indie web</a>. Some were concerned about their freedom of speech, and some believed that things will get better once Elon Musk takes over. Others talked about <abbr title=\"artificial intelligence\">AI</abbr> and how dangerous algorithms can be.<br />\nI don’t want to get into these topics because there are smarter people who could do that way better than me, but I do want to summarise the thoughts that went through my head in the past couple of days.</p>\n<h2>Owning your Content</h2>\n<p>Many people pointed out that this suspension was a perfect example of how important it is to own your own content. Owning your content means that you don’t create content exclusively on a 3rd party site like Twitter or Facebook, but on your own web space and you only syndicate content to other sites. If you get suspended from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Medium, etc. and all your content only exists on these sites, it might happen that from one day to next you don’t have access to your thoughts, ideas, memories, images, demos, etc. anymore.</p>\n<p>I’m really glad that I have a personal website and that I blog there and not on Medium anymore, like I used to several years ago. I also started posting shorter posts like <a href=\"/TIL/\"><abbr title=\"Today I learned\">TILs</abbr></a> on my site, but if I’m honest, I didn’t go all the way. I still post stuff on Twitter first or even Twitter only because it’s just more convenient to post directly to Twitter than to my site and then sharing it on Twitter. Of course, this is just a matter of tooling. I just have to take the time and make it easier for myself to post to my site and <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/syndicating-posts-personal-website-twitter-mastodon\">syndicate content</a>.</p>\n<p>So, I mostly already got that right, but what I learned with this suspension is that owning your content goes beyond blog posts and notes.</p>\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<p>That’s something that surprised me: I can still see my posts, but I don’t have access to my images anymore. Most photos are somewhere on my phone, but all the other images (screenshots, code snippets, etc.) are gone now.</p>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of my suspended Twitter profile. Two posts with images, but instead of the images you only see a placeholder.\" height=\"547\" loading=\"auto\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2022/your-account-is-permanently-suspended/d5e4ea9408-1698950569/twitter_ban7.jpg\" width=\"873\">\n<h3>Messages</h3>\n<p>Being suspended on Twitter also means that you don’t have access to your messages anymore. I’ve used direct messaging quite a lot. Not just for small talk and other casual conversations, but sometimes also for discussing business, side projects, etc. Not having access to these conversations anymore sucks!<br />\nI suppose the person on the other end still has access to all messages. They could just copy and paste the important bits and shift the conversation to email, but it’s still really annoying.</p>\n<p>The lesson learned here is, once conversations get important, move them to email.</p>\n<h3>Bookmarks</h3>\n<p>This one is really bugging me. Bookmarking tweets was a feature I liked a lot. I used it to save tweets for later reference. All my “research” is gone now.</p>\n<p>Lesson learned: Save important tweets elsewhere and/or take screenshots.</p>\n<h3>Comments</h3>\n<p>Most conversations regarding the content I created happened on Twitter or via e-mail. Believe it or not, but one of my favourite things about Twitter was that people could give me direct feedback on my posts or point out mistakes.</p>\n<p>It’s personal preference whether you want to enable people to comment on your blog posts, but I’ll definitely add a comment section to my blog.</p>\n<h3>Logins</h3>\n<p>A day after my suspension I got an email from keybase telling me that my previously-proven twitter identity broke.  </p>\n<p>Lesson learned: It’s probably not the best idea to use social media accounts to log into or identify with other sites.</p>\n<h2>Business</h2>\n<p>Usually when people contact me with business inquiries I ask them how they found me. Often they say that someone recommended me, but sometimes they would tell me that they followed me on Twitter and that they liked my content.</p>\n<p>Being active on Twitter and sharing content played a pretty big role for me as a freelancer. If I’m not on Twitter anymore and if I don’t post elsewhere, will I get less jobs? Yes, probably, because I believe that – at least for me – having a healthy and active online persona is essential. Do I need Twitter for that? If you would’ve had asked me 3 years ago, I would’ve said “Yes”, but now I don’t believe that anymore. I'm convinced that putting all the effort I used to put into social media into my own site will work just as well or even better.</p>\n<h2>Responsibilities</h2>\n<p>Most people were convinced that this suspension must have been a mistake because my account was pretty harmless, but some people shared ideas with me about why I could’ve been banned. Some theories were related to what I said in the past and how I said it. It surprised me that people remembered things I said because they perceived them so negatively. I know that I’m not very well known in the web dev community, but I literally <s>have</s> had thousands of followers. This means that many people read my posts and they care about what I say.</p>\n<p>I guess what I learned here is that as a somewhat public person, even with a small audience, I have certain responsibilities and before I post something overly negative, I should reconsider my words. The ultimate goal is to not be an asshole like the many other people on social media I despise so much.</p>\n<h2>Friendship</h2>\n<p>I few years ago I talked with a colleague about something, I don’t remember anymore what it was. It doesn’t really matter, but in this conversation I said something like “…and my friends on Twitter”. My colleague asked “Are so many of your friends on Twitter?” and I replied “Oh, my <abbr title=\"in real life\">IRL</abbr> friends? No. I’m talking about the friends I met online”. He then said, “But they aren’t real friends. You barely know these people and you haven’t met most of them.”. I replied that I consider them friends, but there was an uncertainty in my voice.</p>\n<p>When my account got suspended, one of the worst things was that I wasn’t able to get in touch with my friends easily anymore – yes, they/you are my friends. I missed reading their ideas, jokes, and rants. It’s true that I barely know most of them and that I’ve only met a couple of people I interact with online every day in real life, but how would you call someone who writes you an e-mail shortly after your suspension to check whether you’re okay and if there’s anything they can do to help? How would you call people who flood Twitter Support with messages demanding them to reenable my account?</p>\n<p>A site like Twitter is not just a sharing platform or a marketing tool, but also a place to hang out with friends.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It’s been a week since my suspension and I haven’t heard a word from Twitter. In the meantime Elon Musk took over and has already made some disturbing decisions and statements. Even if I get my account back, I will not use Twitter anymore, at least not how I used to. I’ve you want to stay in touch with me online, find me on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@matuzo\">Mastodon</a>.</p>\n<p>If there’s something I’ve learned from this whole thing, it’s that I must be more careful with how and where I share my content. A social media platform should not be the primary source. I’ve often advised small business owners to not just use their Facebook profile as their website, for obvious reasons. I, you probably as well, should also take my advice and do the same for my online presence. Create everything on my own website and syndicate elsewhere, because you never know what might happen to your content or profile tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Now is a good time to reclaim control over your content.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse\">Into the Personal-Website-Verse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/going-indie-securing-privacy\">Going Indie.

By using <code>!important</code> we make the first color declaration more important than the second one.</p>\n<p>Now, what about this? Which color does the text have now?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.example2 {\n  --color: red !important;\n\n  color: var(--color);\n  color: blue;\n}</code></pre>\n<details>\n  <summary>Show .example2</summary>\n  <div class=\"example2\">I'm blue!</div>\n</details>\n<p>In order to understand that, we have to look at the spec. There it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Custom properties can contain a trailing !important, but this is automatically removed from the property’s value by the CSS parser,…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aha! It's okay to use it, but it will be removed from the value by the parser, and since it's removed, the second color declaration overwrites the first one.  </p>\n<p>Why can we use it, if the CSS parser removes it anyway? Well, because the sentence continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…and makes the custom property \"important\" in the CSS cascade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Custom properties are just like ordinary properties in CSS part of the cascade and they follow its rules. If you take the following example, which color does the text have?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.example3 {\n  --color: red;\n  --color: blue;\n\n  color: var(--color);\n}</code></pre>\n<details>\n  <summary>Show .example3</summary>\n  <div class=\"example3\">I'm blue!</div>\n</details>\n<p>Why? Because declarations defined later in the document overwrite those defined earlier, if they have the same specificity. This applies to custom properties just like it does to ordinary properties.</p>\n<p>We can change the specificity in CSS by using different selectors or by making a property <code>!important</code>.<br />\nWith that in mind, can you guess which color the text has in the following example?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.example4 {\n  --color: red !important;\n  --color: blue;\n\n  color: var(--color);\n}</code></pre>\n<details>\n  <summary>Show .example4</summary>\n  <div class=\"example4\">I'm red!</div>\n</details>\n<p>I'm sure you got that one right! One last example, to conclude this topic. Which color does the text have?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.example5 {\n  --color: red !important;\n  --color: blue;\n\n  color: var(--color);\n  color: blue;\n}</code></pre>\n<details>\n  <summary>Show .example5</summary>\n  <div class=\"example5\">I'm blue!</div>\n</details>\n<p>This post is based on a chapter in an <a href=\"https://dev.to/afif/what-no-one-told-you-about-css-variables-553o\">article written bei Temani Afif</a>.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+29%3A+%21important+custom+properties%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

It's the maximum value we define because in the list of provided parameters, <code>min()</code> will always pick the smallest value. For example, <code>width: min(700px, 90%)</code> is always 700px or less, which means that the maximum width is 700px.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  width: min(90%, 700px);\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<div class=\"div min\">700px or less with no min-width</div>\n</div>\n<p>We can use the <code>max()</code> function to define a minimum value for a property. It's the minimum value we define because in the list of provided parameters, <code>max()</code> will always pick the largest value. For example, <code>width: max(300px, 90%)</code> is always 300px or more, which means that the minimum width is 300px.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  width: max(300px, 90%);\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<div class=\"div max\">300px or more with no explicit max-width</div>\n</div>\n<p>If we want to define a default value and both a minimum and maximum value, we could do this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  width: max(300px, min(90%, 700px));\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<div class=\"div minmax\">90% with 300px min-width and 700px max-width</div>\n</div>\n<p>The <code>max()</code> function picks the largest value, either <code>300px</code> or the result of the <code>min()</code> function if it's larger than <code>300px</code>. This defines the minimum width. The <code>min()</code> function picks the lowest value, either <code>700px</code> or <code>90%</code> if it's less than <code>700px</code>. This the defines the maximum width with <code>90%</code> as the default value.<br />\nSince nesting functions is super complicated and my brain still hurts from writing this paragraph, there's a handy alternative for this, <code>clamp()</code>.<br />\n<code>clamp()</code> takes three parameters, a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum value.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  width: clamp(300px, 90%, 700px);\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<div class=\"div clamp\">90% with 300px min-width and 700px max-width</div>\n</div>\n<p>The <code>width</code> of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is 90% with a minimum width of 300px and maximum width of 700px. It's basically a shorter way of writing:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  width: 90%;\n  min-width: 300px;\n  max-width: 700px;\n}</code></pre><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+32%3A+the+clamp%28%29+function%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Day 34: :is() or :where()",
    "partialText": "<p>Thoughts on when it’s better to use <code>:is()</code> over <code>:where()</code> and vice versa.</p><p>The other day, I posted this code snippet on social media, asking people whether it was readable.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">summary:where(:hover, :focus-visible)::after {\n  transform: rotate(180deg);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Some people responded they prefer <code>:is()</code> over <code>:where()</code> because it’s shorter or less typing. Others said they liked <code>:where()</code> better because grammatically it made more sense to them or because it just sounded better. </p>\n<p>These sound like valid reasons to pick one over the other, but they shouldn’t be (the main) reasons. As we already know, there is an important <a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day14/\">difference between :is() and :where()</a>. The specificity of <code>:where()</code> is always 0, while <code>:is()</code> takes on the specificity of the most specific selector in its arguments.</p>\n<p>I thought that was clear to me, but a brief discussion following my initial question made me realize that I needed to put a bit more thinking into the topic. Kilian asked me whether I find myself defaulting to <code>:is()</code> or <code>:where()</code>, and I responded “:where() because I like to keep the specificity curve as flat as possible”. Then Šime responded “But <code>summary:hover</code> <em>should</em> have a higher specificity than <code>summary</code>. That’s a good thing.”, and he's right!</p>\n<h2>The case for <code>:is()</code></h2>\n<p>In the following example, I'm defining that the background color of the <code>summary</code> should be blue and change to red on hover and focus. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">summary:hover,\nsummary:focus-visible {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n\nsummary {\n  background-color: blue;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that the declaration for the default state of the element comes later in the document, but it doesn't overwrite the styles for the hover and focus states because its specificity is lower. I guess we can agree that it would make more sense to write it the other way around, but it's a good thing that it still works that way. The <code>:hover</code> and <code>:focus-visible</code> pseudo-classes make the selector more specific, because it's their job to define styles for a specific scenario.</p>\n<style>\n  summary {\n    color: #fff;\n    padding: 0.3rem;\n  }\n  .default summary:hover,\n  .default summary:focus-visible {\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n  .default summary {\n    background-color: blue;\n  }\n  .where summary:where(:hover, :focus-visible) {\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n  .where summary {\n    background-color: blue;\n  }\n  .is summary:is(:hover, :focus-visible) {\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n  .is summary {\n    background-color: blue;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<details class=\"default\">\n  <summary>Show more info</summary>\n  <p>Here's the info</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n<p>Now, let’s do the same using <code>:where()</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">summary:where(:hover, :focus-visible) {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n\nsummary {\n  background-color: blue;\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<details class=\"where\">\n  <summary>Show more info</summary>\n  <p>Here's the info</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n<p>Now the background color is always blue because the specificity of the first and second selector is the same and the second selector, which comes later in the document, overwrites the styles of the first selector.</p>\n<p><code>:where()</code> nulls the specificity of its selectors. While it’s a good practice to keep specificity low, sometimes we need higher specific to assure that certain rules will be applied.<br />\nThis is an example where we want to maintain the specificity of the selectors, and we can do that by using <code>:is()</code>. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">summary:is(:hover, :focus-visible) {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n\nsummary {\n  background-color: blue;\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<details class=\"is\">\n  <summary>Show more info</summary>\n  <p>Here's the info</p>\n</details>\n</div>\n<h2>The case for <code>:where()</code></h2>\n<style>\n  .default input[type=\"text\"],\n  .default input[type=\"email\"],\n  .default input[type=\"url\"] {\n    background-color: #efefef;\n    border: 2px solid;\n  }\n  .default [aria-invalid=\"true\"] {\n    border-color: red;\n  }\n  .where input:where(\n  [type=\"text\"], \n  [type=\"email\"], \n  [type=\"url\"]) {\n    background-color: #efefef;\n    border: 2px solid;\n  }\n  .where [aria-invalid=\"true\"] {\n    border-color: red;\n  }\n</style>\n<p>Sometimes we need selectors with higher specificity to improve readability and comprehensibility, or to limit the elements styles will be applied to.</p>\n<p>For example, in your base styles you might have something like this.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">input[type=\"text\"],\ninput[type=\"email\"],\ninput[type=\"url\"] {\n  background-color: #efefef;\n  border: 2px solid;\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;label for=\"name\"&gt;name&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"name\"&gt;</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<div class=\"default\">\n<label for=\"name\">Name</label><br>\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"name\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Now, let's say you want to change the border color when the data provided by the user is invalid.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">[aria-invalid=\"true\"] {\n  border-color: red;\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;label for=\"name\"&gt;name&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" aria-invalid=\"true\"&gt;</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<div class=\"default\">\n<label for=\"name1\">Name</label><br>\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"name1\" aria-invalid=\"true\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The color of the border doesn't change because <code>input[type=\"text\"]</code> is more specific than <code>[aria-invalid=\"true\"]</code>. We don't need <code>input[type=\"text\"]</code> to be that specific, but the combination of tag and attribute selector makes it easier for us to understand what's going on and it rules out other elements which potentially might have a <code>type</code> attribute with these values.</p>\n<p>We can use <code>:where()</code> to lower the specificity of the selector.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">input:where(\n  [type=\"text\"], \n  [type=\"email\"], \n  [type=\"url\"]) {\n  background-color: #efefef;\n  border: 2px solid;\n}\n\n[aria-invalid=\"true\"] {\n  border-color: red;\n}</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<div class=\"where\">\n  <label for=\"name2\">Name</label><br>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"name2\" aria-invalid=\"true\" placeholder=\"\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Now <code>[aria-invalid=\"true\"]</code> (specificity of a class/attribute) overrules <code>input:where(…)</code> (specificity of an element).</p>\n<p>I will take <a href=\"https://kilianvalkhof.com/\">Kilians</a> and <a href=\"https://webplatform.news/\">Šimes</a> advice and use <code>:is()</code> by default from now on because most of the time we need our complex selector to have a certain specificity. Only in exceptional cases, it's better to use <code>:where()</code> to decrease the specificity.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+34%3A+%3Ais%28%29+or+%3Awhere%28%29%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

That's because by slotting content you're not moving it from the light DOM to the shadow DOM. The nodes physically stay where they are, they're just reflected inside the web component. This also means that global document styles still apply. By using <code>::slotted()</code> we can add additional styles, but by default these styles have lower specificity than global document styles.<br />\nThat changes if we add <code>!important</code> to the mix.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const styles = document.createElement('style')\nstyles.innerHTML = `\n  p {\n    background-color: salmon;\n  }\n\n  ::slotted(p) {\n    background-color: red !important;\n  }\n`\nthis.shadowRoot.appendChild(styles)</code></pre>\n<div class=\"sample\">\n<slot-component4>\n  <p>slotted</p>\n</slot-component4>\n</div><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+45%3A+the+specificity+of+%3A%3Aslotted%28%29+content%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

With container queries, you can now do the same but with any parent element. Instead of the viewport, you can now listen to properties and features of a containing element.</p><p>You can query all kinds of things, not just the width, height, or orientation, but for example custom properties, as well. There’s an important difference between size container features (<code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>inline-size</code>, <code>block-size</code>, <code>aspect-ratio</code>, <code>orientation</code>) and style container features (computed values). If you want to query size container features, you have to define a size container explicitly. That’s because they require special size containment in order to function. </p>\n<p>Miriam Suzanne explains it in <a href=\"https://www.oddbird.net/2022/08/18/cq-syntax/\">Use the Right Container Query Syntax</a> like that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Normally, the size of an element would be based on the size of its contents – but if we query that size, and change the contents based on the query, we have an infinite loop. Size containment breaks that loop by ensuring the size of a container is not based on the size of its contents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can create a size container using the <code>container-type</code> property. There are two options: <code>inline-size</code> (establishes size containment on the inline axis) and <code>size</code> (establishes size containment on the inline and block axis). There’s no dedicated <code>block-size</code> option and we should be careful using <code>size</code>, according to Miriam Suzanne. I don’t really understand why yet, but I’ll dig into that in a separate post.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Latest news&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Hey, I'm a card!&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* That's our size container. */\nsection {\n  width: 50%;\n  container-type: inline-size;\n}\n\n/* Default styles for the card. */\n.card {\n  background-color: yellow;\n  border: 5px solid;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>We can query the container using <code>@container</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* The background-color of the .card \nchanges to hotpink once the section\nhas a min-width of 500px */\n@container (min-width: 500px) {\n  .card {\n    background-color: hotpink;\n  }\n}\n\n/* For comparison: The border-style\nof the .card  changes to dotted once\nthe viewport has a min-width of 500px */\n@media (min-width: 500px) {\n  .card {\n    border-style: dotted;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  [data-sample] section {\n    container-type: inline-size;\n    outline: 10px solid;\n    overflow: auto;\n  }\n  [data-sample] .card {\n    background-color: yellow;\n    border: 5px solid;\n    padding: 1rem;\n    margin: 1rem;\n  }\n    [data-sample] h2 {\n      margin: 1rem;\n    }\n    [data-sample] .card h2 {\n      background: none;\n    }\n    @container (min-width: 500px) {\n      [data-sample] .card {\n        background-color: hotpink;\n      }\n    }\n    @media (min-width: 500px) {\n      [data-sample] .card {\n        border-style: dotted;\n      }\n    }\n</style>\n<p>You can grab and resize the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> by clicking and dragging it in the bottom right corner.

    "partialText": "<p>Like many others, I’ve been thinking a lot about Twitter, social media in general, and what being on a social media platform means for me.</p><p>The other day I logged into Twitter with my HTMHell account and I looked at the feed. It was full of opinions by “tech personalities” (men), funny tweets, and random videos. It felt like being on Reddit or 9gag. That’s not the reason I’m on social media. To be fair, it mostly showed recommended tweets because I only follow 3 accounts (React, Vue, and Angular. Funny, right?), but others told me that their feeds are full of NFT and crypto spam and Musk’s brain farts, too.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Twitter timeline again after a month of being on Mastodon made me realize just how fucked up Twitter is. So much superficial, attention seeking and useless crap driven by the urge for more and more engagement fueled by a harmful algorithm. This form of social media is not good for us. And it’s not just Twitter, Instagram and TikTok aren’t any better. The other day I saw a report on TV that talked about the severe psychological consequences social media has on us and our self-perception.</p>\n<p>(Too much) social media is not good for us. Yes, I know, that’s not a new insight, but I feel like I’m finally being honest with myself for the first time in terms of my behaviour on social media. Just like others constantly post photos to get attention and engagement, I did the same with other content. I feel like it’s time for me to restart. Social media is great for many reasons, but I believe I wasn’t using it correctly.</p>\n<p>By the end of the year, I will delete the HTMHell Twitter account. No, not deactivate, delete! Many say that they still want to keep their accounts in case things might get better again, but I believe they're lying to themselves. The ship has sailed, Twitter is dead.</p>\n<p>I will move my personal website to a different stack. A CMS instead of 11ty. When <a href=\"https://andy-bell.co.uk/the-daunting-prospect-of-writing-again/\">I asked Andy</a> how he made comments work on his static site, he replied, “Ah this is a WordPress site! That was the problem—I was messing around so much with tech, rather than just, y’know, writing. This setup makes it super easy for me :)”, and he’s absolutely right. I want to enable comments on my site and maybe even add a login, and I really don’t want to jump through hoops for something as easy as that just because I want to use a certain stack.</p>\n<p>I’ll reactivate the <a href=\"https://www.htmhell.dev/newsletter/\">HTMHell Newsletter</a>. I’ve started it about a year ago but quickly got bored or overwhelmed. I don’t know. Maybe I didn’t get as much engagement as on Twitter? :) Anyways, I believe newsletters are I still a nice way of sharing and retrieving information.</p>\n<p>I’ll use Mastondon to keep in touch with friends and share ideas, but I won’t promote my work as much on there. If people want to follow my work, they can visit my site or follow via RSS.</p>\n<p>And finally, I’ve deleted the Mastodon app on my smartphone. Checking the site whenever I’m in front of a computer should be enough. This means no social media in the evening and on weekends for me. Doesn’t sound too bad.</p>\n<p>Let’s see how that goes. :)</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CRestart%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

Now here comes the big revelation (at least to me) Sara writes about: There's also a dark theme.</p>\n<p>The thing is, if you change the color mode in your operating system from dark to light, the colors in the browser’s viewport stay the same (If you know of an operating system (OS)/browser where that's different, please tell me). You have to instruct the browser first about what to do. You can do that by using the <code>color-scheme</code> property.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html {\n  /* Indicates that the element can be rendered using the \n  operating system dark color scheme. */\n  color-scheme: dark;\n}</code></pre>\n<figure style=\"margin-bottom: 2.4rem\"><img src=\"https://www.htmhell.dev/images/advent2022/19/bare-html.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of two bare-HTML mini-sites, one light, one dark\" width=\"873\" height=\"838\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>Comparison of two mock plain HTML sites, one with color-scheme set to light, one set to dark. (source: HTMHell)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Note: the following results are only based on tests on macOS 13.0.1 and Android 12.</em></p>\n<p>If you set <code>color-scheme: dark</code>, the whole document will be rendered in a dark scheme, even if the color mode of the OS is light. The same goes for using <code>color-scheme: light</code> in dark mode, the document will be rendered in a light scheme.</p>\n<p>If you want to take advantage of this feature, but you still want to respect user preference, you have to provide two values.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html {\n  color-scheme: dark light;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>If the color mode in the OS is light, the color scheme of the document will be light. If the color mode is dark, the scheme will be dark. If you don't have a preference, <code>dark</code> might be used first because it comes first in the list, but I can't confirm that. On macOS at least, the document is always rendered in light mode when the color mode is “auto” in the OS, no matter the order of the values. It only changes when the operating system changes the mode automatically, as well.</p>\n<p>You can try it yourself on this page by changing the value from “normal” to <code>light</code>, <code>dark</code>, <code>light dark</code>, or <code>dark light</code> in this editable style element and adjusting the preference in your OS or in your Dev Tools settings.</p>\n<style class=\"editable-style\" contenteditable>html {\n  color-scheme: normal;\n}</style>\n<p>The property is not limited to the root element, you can also apply it to parts of your page. </p>\n<h2>light default</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;fieldset&gt;\n  &lt;legend&gt;Pick a language&lt;/legend&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang\" id=\"css\"&gt; \n  &lt;label for=\"css\"&gt;CSS&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n  &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang\" id=\"html\"&gt;\n  &lt;label for=\"html\"&gt;HTML&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n  &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang\" id=\"js\"&gt;\n  &lt;label for=\"js\"&gt;JS&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/fieldset&gt;</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"light default\">\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Pick a language</legend>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang\" id=\"css\"> \n  <label for=\"css\">CSS</label><br>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang\" id=\"html\">\n  <label for=\"html\">HTML</label><br>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang\" id=\"js\">\n  <label for=\"js\">JS</label><br>\n</fieldset>\n</div>\n<h2>light default with dark background</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">fieldset {\n  background-color: #000;\n  color: #fff;\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"light default\" style=\"background-color: #000;\">\n<fieldset style=\"background-color: #000; color: #fff;\">\n  <legend>Pick a language</legend>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang2\" id=\"css2\"> \n  <label for=\"css2\">CSS</label><br>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang2\" id=\"html2\">\n  <label for=\"html2\">HTML</label><br>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang2\" id=\"js2\">\n  <label for=\"js2\">JS</label><br>\n</fieldset>\n</div>\n<h2>dark with dark background</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">fieldset {\n  color-scheme: dark;\n  background-color: #000;\n  color: #fff;\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"dark with color-scheme: dark\" style=\"background-color: #000;\">\n<fieldset style=\"color-scheme: dark; background-color: #000; color: #fff;\">\n  <legend>Pick a language</legend>\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang3\" id=\"css3\"> \n  <label for=\"css3\">CSS</label><br>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang3\" id=\"html3\">\n  <label for=\"html3\">HTML</label><br>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"lang3\" id=\"js3\">\n  <label for=\"js3\">JS</label><br>\n</fieldset>\n</div>\n<p>I had to apply the background color manually, but you can see how the form elements look differently, optimized for dark mode.</p>\n<h2>dark on a form element</h2>\n<p>You can also apply the property to a form element directly.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">select {\n  color-scheme: dark;\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;label for=\"color2\"&gt;Favorite color&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;select id=\"color2\"&gt;\n  &lt;option&gt;Aqua&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option&gt;Fuchsia&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n<label for=\"color2\">Favorite color</label><br>\n<select id=\"color2\" style=\"color-scheme: dark\">\n  <option>Aqua</option>\n  <option>Fuchsia</option>\n</select>\n</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+61%3A+color-scheme%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>In a media query, it’s obvious what <em>width</em> means. It always refers to the width of the viewport. With size container queries it’s not that obvious.</p><pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* Kicks in when the viewport has a minimum width of 500px */\n@media (min-width: 500px) {\n  body {\n    background-color: hotpink;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p><code>width</code> in a size container query queries the width of the container's content box. Let me illustrate what that means with an example.</p>\n<p>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> is the container and the <code>.card</code> changes background color when the container has a minimum width of 500px.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Latest news&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Hey, I'm a card!&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> has an explicit width, padding, and a border.

The container query fires when the width without padding and border (<code>content-box</code>) is at least 500px, not when the total width is 500px. </p>\n<div class=\"highlight\">\n<p>You can grab and resize the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> by clicking and dragging it in the bottom right corner.

The container query still only fires when the content-box is at least 500px.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">section {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  container-type: inline-size;\n\n  width: 500px;\n  padding: 20px;\n  border: 10px solid;\n}\n\n@container (min-width: 500px) {\n  .card {\n    background-color: hotpink;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\" class=\"sample2\">\n<section>\n<h2>total width: 500px,<br>content-box: 460px</h2>\n<div class=\"card\">\n<h2>Hey, I'm a card!</h2>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n<script>\n  const sections = document.querySelectorAll('[data-sample] section');\n  const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver((entries) => {\n  for (const entry of entries) {\n    entry.target.querySelector('h2').innerHTML = \n      `total width: ${Math.round(entry.target.getBoundingClientRect().width)}px,<br>\n        content-box: ${Math.round(entry.contentRect.width)}px`\n  }\n  console.log('Size changed');\n  });\n  resizeObserver.observe(sections[0]);\n  resizeObserver.observe(sections[1]);\n</script>\n<p>So, when we talk about width in a size container query, it always refers to the size of the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-sizing/#valdef-box-sizing-content-box\">content-box</a>.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+69%3A+width+in+container+queries%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

It’s much smaller and calmer than Vienna, but nice.</p>\n<div class=\"image-grid\">\n  <img alt=\"Again our fully packed van but this time with furniture\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2023/a-year-in-review-2022/04d6c9ce03-1698950543/IMG_20220729_094633_thumb.jpg\" width=\"436\">\n  <img alt=\"First selfie of me, my fiance and our daughter in our new home\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2023/a-year-in-review-2022/7ee1118706-1698950544/IMG_20220728_155617_thumb.jpg\" width=\"436\">\n</div>\n<p>This year I ran the first part of the relay marathon at the Vienna City Marathon. I did 5:14/km at a distance of 15.5km and I added another 5 kilometers for fun, which I ran in 6:43/km. I’m pretty happy with the result and I hope I can beat it this year.</p>\n<p>What didn’t go well? I still didn’t have enough time and energy left for the rest of my family and my friends. I really want to fix that this year. Also, I have to make room for reading. I didn’t read a single book last year, and newspapers not as much as I would like to. </p>\n<p>I was able to maintain my body weight more or less, but I actually wanted to lose some weight. Today I have ~90kg. I’d love to get down to 85kg.</p>\n<p>The pandemic didn't hit me as much as other people, but I can feel how the general situation (war in Ukraine, covid, supression in Iran, increasing worldwide poverty, the rise of far right movements, climate crisis, etc.) effects me emotionally. I'm in no position to complain, though. I understand how priviledged I am.</p>\n<h2>Work</h2>\n<p>This year working for the City of Vienna was really busy. We had so much to do and a lot of internal discussions on how to do things. It was stressful, but I enjoyed it. The most notable event was our decision to switch to web components. I’ve spent a great deal of 2022 writing web components and I’ve learned a lot about JavaScript, reusability, and scalability.</p>\n<p>December 31st was the last day for me working for the City of Vienna as a regular employee. I’ve worked for almost 4 years for Wien Holding Media and the Presse- and Informationsdienst (MA 53). My original plan was to give it a shot and quit after 2 years if it gets too boring, but it never did. I had amazing colleagues, interesting tasks, a lot of freedom in many aspects, and a boss you can only wish for. Moving to Graz didn’t just mark a new personal, but also a new professional chapter in my life. I’ll keep working with the City now and then, but starting 2023 I want to focus on new tasks (by the way, if you want to work with me, <a href=\"/about-me/\">get in touch</a>. :))</p>\n<p>Besides my work for the city, I did a couple of accessibility audits, for example, for the Burgtheater in Vienna. I’ve helped an agency consult the Vienna University of Technology, and I did some workshops. Two online and one in-person workshops for Smashing Magazine and an online workshop with Shopify.</p>\n<p>Objectively speaking, you can say that I worked too much last year, but doing less makes me unhappy. It sounds silly, but I need this sometimes stressful, face-paced, always busy environment in order to feel good. After making bad experiences with doing too much of the wrong kind of work a couple of years ago, I feel pretty confident that I can now judge when it becomes too much for me.</p>\n<p>This year I want to focus more on teaching (through my blog, HTMHell and workshops) and consulting. If there’s one thing I can do to make the web a better place, it’s teaching others how to make inclusive websites.</p>\n<h2>Speaking</h2>\n<p>In 2022 I could check off so my things from my bucket list. I wrote a new talk called “<a href=\"https://noti.st/matuzo/hyO5e3/lost-in-translation\">Lost in Translation</a>” and I presented it at Beyond Tellerrand, Smashing Conf in Freiburg, Fronteers, and Paris Web. </p>\n<p>Here's a recording of my talk:</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wno1IhEBTxc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>After 2 years without conferences, it felt so great to meet some of my friends again in person and other friends I made online for the first time.</p>\n<p>In Düsseldorf, I met Stephanie Eckles, Marc Thiele, Joschi Kuphal, Matthias Ott, Niels Binder, Marco Hengstenberg, Oliver Schöndorfer, Gunnar Bittersmann, Marc Hinse, Maik, Robert Weber, Daniel Wentsch, Thomas Semmler, Reinhard Steudel, Vasilis van Gemert, and many more. In Freiburg, I met Andy Bell, Michelle Barker, Charis and Jarijn, Vitaly, Ari, Amanda, Iris, Samuel Snopko, Nathan Curtis, Harry Roberts, Barry Pollard, and many more. In Utrecht, I met Bramus van Damme, Schepp, Jewwy Qadri, Michael Hastrich, Niels Leenheer, Roudy Rabouw, Floor Drees, Erik Kroes, and many more.

I assume that most of you already knew that. Now let’s have a look at cascade layers and what happens if we use <code>!important</code> in layers.</p>\n<h2>Layers</h2>\n<p>We have two layers, each with a declaration with the same specificity. The second declaration wins because it’s in a layer defined later in the document.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@layer base {\n  h1 {\n    color: green;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  h1 {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo 3\" class=\"sample3\">\n  <h1>I'm red</h1>\n</div>\n<p>If we add un-layered styles, the color turns blue because un-layered styles have precedence over layered styles.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">h1 {\n  color: blue;\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  h1 {\n    color: green;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  h1 {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo 4\" class=\"sample4\">\n  <h1>I'm blue</h1>\n</div>\n<p>If we add <code>!important</code> to the declaration in the base layer, the color turns green.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">h1 {\n  color: blue;\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  h1 {\n    color: green !important;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  h1 {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo 5\" class=\"sample5\">\n  <h1>I'm green</h1>\n</div>\n<p>Okay, I have to stop here for a moment. All this makes sense to me. Here’s what I thought happens before I wrote this blog post:</p>\n<p>By default, our order of precedence is like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Un-layered styles (most important)</li>\n<li>components layer</li>\n<li>base layer (least important)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Demo 3 and 4 confirm that.</p>\n<p>If we add <code>!important</code> to the declaration in the base layer, our order looks like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>!important base layer (most important)</li>\n<li>Un-layered styles</li>\n<li>components layer</li>\n<li>base layer (least important)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Demo 5 confirms that.</p>\n<p>If I keep extending my logic, this would mean that if we add <code>!important</code>to the components layer, the order looks like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>!important components layer (most important)</li>\n<li>!important base layer</li>\n<li>Un-layered styles</li>\n<li>components layer </li>\n<li>base layer(least important)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s try!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">h1 {\n  color: blue;\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  h1 {\n    color: green !important;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  h1 {\n    color: red !important;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo 6\" class=\"sample6\">\n  <h1>I'm green</h1>\n</div>\n<p>Nooope, not red, still green. To explain why, let's have a look at the spec.</p>\n<blockquote>“CSS attempts to create a balance of power between author and user style sheets. By default, rules in an author’s style sheet override those in a user’s style sheet, which override those in the user-agent’s default style sheet. To balance this, a declaration can be marked important, which increases its weight in the cascade and <strong>inverts the order of precedence</strong>” <em>(emphasis mine)</em>.</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#importance\">CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 3</a></p>\n<p>This means that <code>!important</code> doesn't just increase the weight of a declaration in the cascade, but it inverts the order of precedence. So, in our first basic example <code>!important</code> doesn't just make the first declaration more important, no, it inverts the order of precedence!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">h1 {\n  color: green !important;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  color: red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>If we make the first declaration important, this…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>h1 color red (most important)</li>\n<li>h1 color green (least important)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>…becomes this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>h1 color green (most important)</li>\n<li>h1 color red (least important)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before cascade layers, this didn’t really matter, but now, with multiple layers on the author level, understanding this concept is critical. If we apply this logic to our last layer example, we get this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>!important base layer (most important)</li>\n<li>!important components layer</li>\n<li>!important un-layered styles</li>\n<li>Un-layered styles</li>\n<li>components layer </li>\n<li>base layer(least important)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, even if we add <code>!important</code> to the un-layered styles, the declaration in the base layer still wins.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">h1 {\n  color: blue !important;\n}\n\n@layer base {\n  h1 {\n    color: green !important;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  h1 {\n    color: red !important;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo 7\" class=\"sample7\">\n  <h1>I'm still green</h1>\n</div>\n<p>Got it? No? Don't worry. It took me more than an hour to understand it.

    "title": "Day 82: value processing",
    "partialText": "<p>This post differs from most of the other posts because it’s not about modern CSS, but about CSS fundamentals. When I was writing about <a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day1/\">custom properties</a> and especially about <a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day80/\">container style queries</a>, I realized that I had to understand some of the basics of the language first before I could comprehend how certain properties and rules worked.</p><p>The final value of a property in CSS is the result of a multi-step calculation. In this process, the actual value of a property can come from different sources, take on different forms, and undergo adjustments.</p>\n<h2>Declared Values</h2>\n<p>A property may have multiple declared values. Each property declaration applied to an element contributes a declared value.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">h1 {\n  color: aqua;\n}\n\n#heading {\n  color: rebeccapurple;\n}\n\n.heading {\n  color: fuchsia;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>color</code> property has 3 declared values. The cascade takes theses values and chooses a single “winning” value, the cascaded value.</p>\n<h2>Cascaded Value</h2>\n<p>The cascaded value represents the result of the cascade. It’s the declared value with the highest precedence.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">#heading {\n  color: rebeccapurple;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>Specified Value</h2>\n<p>If the cascade results in a value, the specified value equals the cascaded value. If not, the property must take their value from somewhere else. Inherited properties draw their value from their parent element. All other properties use their initial value.</p>\n<p>If we take the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> as an example, we get the following values and origins for the <code>border-bottom-color</code>, <code>border-bottom-style</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>font-family</code>, and <code>width</code> properties. (These properties are just examples).</p>\n<table>\n  <caption>h1 specified values</caption>\n<thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>property</th>\n      <th>value</th>\n      <th>origin</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>border-bottom-color</code></td>\n      <td>currentColor</td>\n      <td>initial</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>border-bottom-style</code></td>\n      <td>none</td>\n      <td>initial</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>color</code></td>\n      <td>rebeccapurple</td>\n      <td>cascaded</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>font-family</code></td>\n      <td>Depends on the user agent</td>\n      <td>inherited</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>width</code></td>\n      <td>auto</td>\n      <td>initial</td>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n</table>\n<h2>Computed value</h2>\n<p>A specified value can either be relative or absolute. Relative means relative to another value, like <code>50%</code>, <code>2em</code>, or <code>lighter</code>. Absolute is the opposite, for example, <code>200px</code>, <code>2mm</code>, or <code>bold</code>.</p>\n<p>The computed value results from resolving value dependencies, which generally means absolutizing relative values. You can find how a property value is resolved in the property definition table of the property in the specification.</p>\n<table>\n  <caption>h1 computed values</caption>\n<thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>property</th>\n      <th>specified value</th>\n      <th>computed value</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>border-bottom-color</code></td>\n      <td>currentColor</td>\n      <td>rgb(102, 51, 153)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>border-bottom-style</code></td>\n      <td>none</td>\n      <td>none</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>color</code></td>\n      <td>rebeccapurple</td>\n      <td>rgb(102, 51, 153)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>font-family</code></td>\n      <td>Depends on the user agent</td>\n      <td>Times (for example)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>width</code></td>\n      <td>auto</td>\n      <td>auto</td>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n</table>\n<h2>Used value</h2>\n<p>In the previous chapter, I said that computing values <em>generally</em> means absolutizing relative values. For example, <code>font-size: 1rem;</code> becomes <code>font-size: 16px;</code>, but that’s not true for every property. </p>\n<p><code>width: 80%;</code> stays <code>width: 80%</code>. Per definition, the computed value of the <code>width</code> property is <em>“as specified”</em>. That’s because <code>width: 80%;</code> can’t be resolved into a length without knowing the layout of the element’s ancestors.</p>\n<p>The used value takes the computed value and completes any remaining calculations to make it the absolute theoretical value used in the formatting of the document. For example, <code>width: 80%;</code> becomes <code>width: 420px</code>.</p>\n<table>\n  <caption>h1 used values</caption>\n<thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>property</th>\n      <th>computed value</th>\n      <th>used value</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>border-bottom-color</code></td>\n      <td>rgb(102, 51, 153)</td>\n      <td>rgb(102, 51, 153)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>border-bottom-style</code></td>\n      <td>none</td>\n      <td>none</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>color</code></td>\n      <td>rgb(102, 51, 153)</td>\n      <td>rgb(102, 51, 153)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>font-family</code></td>\n      <td>Times</td>\n      <td>Times</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>width</code></td>\n      <td>auto</td>\n      <td>1062.27px (for example)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n</table>\n<h2>Actual value</h2>\n<p>In principle, the <em>“used value”</em> is ready, but the user agent may need to adjust the value in order to make use of it.

    "title": "Day 83: computed values in container style queries",
    "partialText": "<p>On <a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day80/\">day 80</a>, I’ve explained that we can check whether a container has a specific property and value assigned and apply additional styles based on this condition. On <a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day82/\">day 82</a>, I’ve explained that the value of a property can come from different sources, undergo adjustments before it becomes the actual value, and take on different forms along the way. To use container style queries, it’s important to understand which value's being used in queries.</p><p>Let’s start nice and easy. We have a <code>.card</code> and the value of the <code>--bg</code> property is <code>red</code>. In a style query, we check if that’s actually the case and apply conditional style to the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> nested in the card.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;heyho&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.card {\n  --bg: red;\n}\n\n@container style(--bg: red) {\n  h1 {\n    border: 10px dotted aqua;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Result: the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> gets a beautiful dotted border.</p>\n<p>If we put the color value in its own property and query the assignment of the <code>var()</code> function to the <code>--bg</code> property, the styles will be applied, as well.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html {\n  --color-red: red;\n}\n\n.card {\n  --bg: var(--color-red);\n}\n\n@container style(--bg: var(--color-red)) {\n  h1 {\n    border: 10px dotted aqua;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Here's where it gets really interesting: If we change the query back to <code>style(--bg: red)</code>, the styles still apply.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html {\n  --color-red: red;\n}\n\n.card {\n  --bg: var(--color-red);\n}\n\n@container style(--bg: red) {\n  h1 {\n    border: 10px dotted aqua;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Even if we never assign <code>--color-red</code> to <code>--bg</code>, but they have the same value, the styles still apply.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">html {\n  --color-red: red;\n}\n\n.card {\n  --bg: red;\n}\n\n@container style(--bg: var(--color-red)) {\n  h1 {\n    border: 10px dotted aqua;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The <em>“simple”</em> explanation is that style queries compare the equality of <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/blog/2023/100daysof-day82/#computed-value\">computed values</a> and not assignments. The computed value results from resolving value dependencies, which generally means absolutizing relative values. Both sides of the query are evaluated and resolved before the comparison.</p>\n<p>So, in each example the actual comparison is something like:  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* Note: this is not valid syntax, it's just an\nillustration of the underlying comparison. */\n@container style(\"red\": \"red\") {\n  h1 {\n    border: 10px dotted aqua;\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+83%3A+computed+values+in+container+style+queries%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

I understand why a color function like <a href=\"/blog/2023/hsl-custom-properties/\"><code>hsl()</code> offers better DX than <code>rgb()</code></a>. I’ve learned that <a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day30/\">rgb(), hsl(), and hwb()</a> use colors from the sRGB color space, and <a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day23/\">lab()</a> and <a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day93/\">lch()</a> colors from the CIELAB color space. These color functions are relevant now because they support more colors and modern monitors can display them. It kinda also makes sense to me why some people say that using <a href=\"https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl#oklch-vs-oklab--lch-vs-lab\">lch() is more intuitive than lab()</a>.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t sound too bad, but as soon as I dig deeper into colors, I soon reach a point where I’m out.

    "title": "Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications",
    "partialText": "<p>Sometimes it seems like accessibility experts and other web professionals hate JavaScript. This might be true for some, but most understand that JavaScript can be useful for improving UX and even accessibility. JavaScript solutions are often more accessible than their <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2020/02/html-the-inaccessible-parts/\">pure HTML</a> or <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/css-javascript-requirements-accessible-components/\">CSS counterparts</a>.</p><p>We know <a href=\"https://www.marcozehe.de/javascript-not-enemy-accessibility/\">JavaScript is not an enemy</a>, but, admittedly, there is a certain reluctance towards building client-side rendered websites by some developers. These people are often dismissed as the “old guard” because of their seemingly irrational aversion towards modern web development. If you don’t understand where this is coming from, it might seem incomprehensible why someone would not want to build single page applications (SPA), but go for the standard way of building websites, sometimes referred to as multi page applications (MPA), instead. </p>\n<p>There has been a lot of criticism about SPAs and especially React recently. On a personal level, I can absolutely understand that. I don’t like Meta and their business model; I don’t like how React thought leaders <a href=\"https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/#what-did-they-know-and-when-did-they-know-it%3F\">sold their library as something that it’s not</a>, and I don’t like the bro culture that sparked from this whole thing. On a professional level, I understand that there are people for whom React is nothing more than a tool or a .js file. People who, you know,…just build websites for a living. Although I’m not happy about it, I also understand that JS libraries and frameworks are often the entry point to web development for new web developers. Nevertheless, there is also valid and serious professional criticism. With this post I’m not trying to convince anyone to build their websites differently, I just want to share my view and my experiences as someone who has been building websites for over 20 years, and I try to summarize reasons why some developers, including me, are wary of building SPAs. Before I give you some examples, let me say one important thing: I know that it’s possible to create accessible single page applications and I know that there are people who work with JS frameworks (because they want to or have to), and optimise the shit out of their websites because they care about their users.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A lot of the scepticism comes from the fact that some critical features of a website work fundamentally different in single page applications. </p>\n<h2>Routing</h2>\n<p>When you create 3 HTML documents, let’s call them home.html, about.html, and dashboard.html, and you link them, clicking a link the following happens: The browser navigates to the new page, the page loads, the title of the page changes in the browser’s tab, focus is on the body, and, if you’re using a screen reader, the software announces the title of the page. Of course, a lot more happens. This is a simplified and incomplete depiction of the process, but the important bit is that no matter how you’re accessing and activating the link (mouse, screen reader, touch, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/V1yoOLhx_qA\">switch device</a>, etc.), you know what happened, that something happened, and where you are. The loading process and the transition from one page to another tell you that you’ve navigated to a new page. Focus is at the beginning of the DOM, where you would expect it, and your screen reader announces the title of the page automatically.</p>\n<figure>\n<video src=\"/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/routing_default.mov\" controls></video>\n<figcaption>When I click a link, NVDA, the screen reader I'm using, announces the title of the page, for example “Dashboard - My Website”.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In a Single Page Application, you create only one HTML document and you replace the main content of the page when the user clicks a link. To achieve that, you may have to use a routing library like React Router. Compared to the process of native routing I’ve described earlier, the following happens: DOM content changes, focus is still on the link, the title in the browser tab doesn’t change, and a screen reader announces nothing. If you’re lucky, you know what happened, that something happened, and where you are. If you’re a blind screen reader user, you’ll most likely get no feedback at all.</p>\n<figure>\n<video src=\"/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/routing_spa.mov\" controls></video>\n<figcaption>When I click a link, NVDA announces nothing.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>While not intentionally, single page applications, at least in terms of page navigation, are inaccessible by design. The creators of reach router did their best to make routing accessible by managing focus, but since data loading and focus management on route transitions are coupled, it was <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/9555?sort=new\">too complicated to do it correctly</a>. Despite all their efforts, routing became completely inaccessible again, when <a href=\"https://reactrouter.com/en/main/upgrading/reach\">reach router and react router</a> merged and they stopped <q>doing not-good-enough focus management by default</q>.</p>\n<p>Custom routing and focus management done right can actually work even better than the native behaviour without JavaScript, but it must be built manually. You don’t see that in many SPAs unfortunately. I’d rather serve users with the not so great, but consistent default experience than no experience at all.<br />\nAnyway, there's a lot we can learn from SPAs and from people with accessbility in mind working with them. There’s fantastic research about that topic by Marcy Sutton (“<a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/\">What we learned from user testing of accessible client-side routing techniques with Fable Tech Labs</a>”).</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the previous demo I was using “Create React App”, one of the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#recommended-toolchains\">recommended toolchains</a> and the <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/github/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/examples/basic?file=src/main.tsx\">basic example in React Router</a>. I can imagine that there are frameworks that support accessible routing by default.</p>\n<h2>The document title</h2>\n<p>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the page is one of the most important elements in a HTML document. Users benefit from a well-formed and descriptive page title in many ways. </p>\n<p>To mitigate inaccessible routing and the missing feedback after clicking a link, screen reader users help themselves by pressing shortcuts that announce the title of the page. The page title tells them on which page they are. So even if there’s no feedback, they know they’re on a new page when the title has changed. If the title has changed! In a SPA, you usually have to implement title management manually. Again, this is something that just works in native routing. </p>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\" aria-labelledby=\"form1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"region\">\n<table>\n  <caption id=\"form1\">Screen reader shortcuts for announcing the page title</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Screen Reader</th>\n      <th>Command</th>\n      <th>Announcement</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>NVDA</td>\n      <td><kbd>Ins</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd></td>\n      <td>Page title</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>JAWS</td>\n      <td><kbd>Ins</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd></td>\n      <td>Page title</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Voice Over on macOS</td>\n      <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd></td>\n      <td>Page summary, including page title</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Voice Over on macOS</td>\n      <td><kbd>VO</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd></td>\n      <td>Page title</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>There are more reasons you'd want to change the page title. It serves as the label for bookmarked pages/favorites, and search engines use the title in their search results pages. Social media sites, chat or mail applications, and similar software use the title in link previews when no other title is specified.</p>\n<p>Before you start sending me links: I know that it's possible, I've done my research. My point is, that it's yet another thing you have to reimplement manually. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hidde.blog/accessible-page-titles-in-a-single-page-app/\">Accessible page titles in a Single Page App</a> by Hidde de Vries</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon/react-document-title\">React Document Title</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet\">React Helmet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/vue-meta\">Vue-meta</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>DOM changes</h2>\n<p>DOM changes are not specific to SPAs, but to using JavaScript in general. The thing is that reactive DOM changes are at the very core of single page applications. For every significant change you make, you have to communicate that change not just visually, but also semantically. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions\">Live regions</a>, ARIA attributes, or focus management can help with that. You won’t find any information about live regions or using <code>focus()</code> for announcing DOM changes in the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html\">official React accessibility docs</a>, the <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/accessibility.html\">Vue accessibility docs</a>, or the <a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/accessibility\">Angular docs</a>.<br />\nThe more JavaScript we add to our page, the more fragile our interface gets and the more we have to manage and communicate manually, if we want to create <a href=\"https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/#provide-comparable-experience\">equal experiences for all</a>.</p>\n<h2>JSX</h2>\n<p>JSX kinda looks like HTML, but it’s not really HTML because it’s a mix of HTML with component tags and made-up attributes (I’m talking about you <code>className</code>). I know that React doesn’t require using JSX, but many new devs learn React and JSX first (and only), because boot camps and indoctrinated communities tell them it's the only real way to build websites and they need to know React in order to get a job. This abstraction can be terrible if you don’t understand the difference between the actual standard (HTML) and the abstraction layer. We’re already <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wno1IhEBTxc\">really bad at writing native HTML</a> and a language that obfuscates the standard language doesn’t make things better.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">&lt;li className=\"item\"&gt;\n  {isPacked ? (\n    &lt;del&gt;\n      {name + ' ✔'}\n    &lt;/del&gt;\n  ) : (\n    name\n  )}\n&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Before we choose to work with any language that is not native HTML, but compiles to HTML, we should <a href=\"https://web.dev/learn/html/\">learn HTML</a> first. This doesn’t just apply to JSX, but Markdown, Pug, NunJucks, etc. Our input will be much better if we know how the output should look like.</p>\n<h2>The page context</h2>\n<p>In SPAs, you create components. A component might be part of another component, and another component until it finally ends up in the wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> of your index.html. If you look at the final document of most SPAs, the page doesn’t look like a coherent entity, but more like a dump for components that happen to form a page visually. As already mentioned, HTML is a cornerstone of any accessible website and the page structure (a sound heading outline, landmarks, DOM order, semantic HTML in general) plays an important role. </p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I also build components that are part of a system, but I also spend a good amount of time crafting pages that work well. The fact that the HTML document is something that you barely touch, because everything you need in there will be injected via JavaScript, puts the document and the page structure out of focus.<br />\nI don’t suggest that a component-based approach is wrong, not even one that is written in a JavaScript environment, quite the opposite, but just because it’s more convenient and efficient to work with a JS framework, doesn’t mean that we have to serve all that JavaScript to the client. The traditional way of serving websites entirely on the client is outdated, but I also don’t believe that concepts like hydration are much better.<br />\nIt’s worth exploring approaches that separate concerns and try to minimize the amount of JS shipped. Some notable projects are <a href=\"https://lit.dev/\">Lit</a>, <a href=\"https://astro.build/\">Astro</a>, <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/11ty/webc\">WebC</a>.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>Most SPAs probably perform well on my 3,500 Euro laptop and my 500 Euro smartphone, but a Macbook Pro and Huawai P30 are not necessarily the average device the average user uses to access the web. I’m not in the position to talk about the performance implications of client-site rendering and especially React, but there has been <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/react-criticism/\">a lot of criticism early on</a> because SPAs just don’t perform as well as thought leaders at Meta or Vercel <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741\">used to make you think</a>.</p>\n<p>I suggest you read the following articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://infrequently.org/2022/12/performance-baseline-2023/\">The Performance Inequality Gap, 2023</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/\">The Market for Lemons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/react-criticism/\">A historical reference of react criticism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://andy-bell.co.uk/speed-for-who/\">Speed for who?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complexity</h2>\n<p>Setting up a SPA from scratch is not simple, it involves many tedious steps. Even if you use one of the boilerplate setups, you’re handling a compound dependency monster that just waits to ruin your day because one tiny detail doesn’t work out of the box the way you want it. There’s so much complexity in these things that it makes some people doubt whether it’s worth the effort and if it’s not maybe smarter to spend the time working on something else, something that actually benefits users.</p>\n<p>I guess the biggest criticism here is that it feels like people who believe in the superiority of single page applications and the entire ecosystem focus more on developer experience (DX) than user experience. That sounds like a dangerous blanket statement, but after all these years, I never had the feeling that the argument “better DX leads to better UX” was ever true. It’s nothing more than a justification for the immense complexity and potentially significantly worse UX. And even if the core argument isn't DX, other arguments like scalability, maintainability, competitive ability, easier recruiting (“everyone uses React”), and cost effectiveness, in my experience, only sound good, but rarely hold up to their promises.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>I hope this didn’t come off as a rant, it’s not. I’m just trying to explain why SPAs are not the first choice or no choice at all for some people. I’m glad that this diverse landscape of tools exists because we can learn from innovation and use this knowledge to create better experiences. I’ve worked with several JS libraries and frameworks, because it pays the bills, but I’ve never used one for my own projects and I’ve never consulted a client to do so, and I probably never will. The simple reason is that I build websites most of the time, and not complex applications. There is a place and time for JS frameworks and client side rendering, but it’s usually not the right choice for the typical website.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CWhy+I%27m+not+the+biggest+fan+of+Single+Page+Applications%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

In this final post, I want to do a quick recap and give an outlook for what's coming next.</p><h2>Recap</h2>\n<p>Starting this project was one of the best and worst ideas I ever had. </p>\n<p>It was a great idea because I’m finally up to date with modern CSS. I’ve learned so so much, not just about the fancy new stuff, but also about CSS in general. Based on the feedback I’ve received, I wasn’t the only one who benefited from this project. This format, short, focused posts about a single topic, worked well for many people. That makes me happy. Thank you for reading and participating!</p>\n<p>It was a bad idea because it was so much work and it put quite a lot of pressure on me at times. Each post took me at least 1 hour to write, sometimes up to 4 hours. In some weeks, that meant spending an entire working day or more writing these posts on top of my other work. Consequently, the quality of some posts is not as good as I’d like it to be.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I’m glad that I finished it. Especially because I’m someone who tends to abandon their side projects quickly since the next more exciting project is already around the corner. </p>\n<h2>My favorite posts</h2>\n<p>I’m happy with how most posts I’ve written have turned out, but, of course, I have some favorites.</p>\n<h3>Top 3 favorite new features</h3>\n<p>I’ve covered a lot of new features in CSS, but I’m most excited about these.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2022/100daysof-day37/\">cascade layers (day37)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day56/\">container queries (day 56)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day84/\">@property (day 84)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Top 3 favorite posts</h3>\n<p>Like I said, this experiment turned out to not just focus on modern CSS, but core CSS concepts, too.

    "partialText": "<p>I know I’m late to the party, but there are a few things on my CSS wish list I haven’t seen on others, so I thought I’d share.</p><h2>Visually hidden content</h2>\n<p>I'd love to see a native implementation of visually hidden text. I’m not the biggest fan of hiding stuff only for some, but it’s inevitable sometimes.</p>\n<p>Instead of this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.visually-hidden {\n  clip-path: inset(50%);\n  height: 1px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  position: absolute;\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  width: 1px;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>I want this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.visually-hidden {\n  visibility: visually-hidden;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Or another example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.skip-link {\n  position: absolute;\n  visibility: visually-hidden;\n}\n\n.skip-link:focus-visible {\n  visibility: visible;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>Alternative text for pseudo elements</h2>\n<p>It would be great if I could exclude generated content from the accessibility tree or give it an accessible name.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">button::before {\n  content: \"c\";\n  font-family: MyIconFont;\n  alt: \"\";\n}</code></pre>\n<p>There is actually an implementation in some browsers that looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">label:has(+[required])::after {\n  content: '★' / 'required';\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Or even better:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">label:has(+[required])::after {\n  content: '★' / attr(data-label-required);\n}</code></pre>\n<h3>Related posts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/heres-what-i-didnt-know-about-content/\">Here’s what I didn’t know about “content”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/10/alternative-text-for-css-generated-content.html\">Alternative Text for CSS Generated Content</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/css-content-accepts-alternative-text/\">The CSS \"content\" property accepts alternative text</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Block links</h2>\n<p>So-called <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/block-links-cards-clickable-regions-etc.html\">block links</a> is something that’s still unsolved in CSS. Let’s say you have a card with a heading, text, image, and a link. In order to avoid accessibility issues, you only want to include a single link and you don’t want to wrap all elements in that link, but you still want the entire card to be clickable. There are different ways of doing that, but there are drawbacks to all of them. I’d basically want to have a native implementation of Heydons <a href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/cards/#thepseudocontenttrick\">pseudo-content trick</a>. </p>\n<p>Maybe something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"\" alt=\"\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;asdasd&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.card {\n  container-type: block-link;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>Bleeding backgrounds</h2>\n<p>When you define a fixed width and a background color for the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, the background fills the entire viewport and not just the body. I think that’s because the property is propagated to the viewport, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> is an exception with this behavior. Anyway, I want a similar behavior for other elements, too, so that I can make the background of an element expand in all directions.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  max-width: 960px;\n  background-color: hotpink;\n  background-bleed: inline;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>It should kinda work like this solution I stole from <a href=\"https://github.com/SelenIT\">Ilya Streltsyn</a>. I have absolutely no idea what’s going on, but it works.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  border-image: conic-gradient( hotpink 0 0) fill 1//0 50vw\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  [data-sample] div {\n    border-image: conic-gradient( hotpink 0 0) fill 1//0 50vw\n  }\n</style>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\">\n<div>\ntest\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>PS: <em>Bleeding backgrounds</em> is a fantastic name for a band.</p>\n<h2>Other wish lists</h2>\n<p>There’s more on my list, but it has been already covered by others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From Chris’ wish list: <a href=\"https://chriscoyier.net/2022/12/21/things-css-could-still-use-heading-into-2023/#animate-to-auto\">animate to auto</a></li>\n<li>From Tyler’s list: <a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/tylers-css-wish-list-for-2023/\">View Transitions API</a></li>\n<li>From Dave’s list: <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2023/01/css-wishlist-2023/\">leading-trim</a></li>\n<li>From Eric’s list: <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/02/08/css-wish-list-2023/#more-attr\">More attr()</a></li>\n<li>From Ahmad’s list: <a href=\"https://ishadeed.com/article/css-wishlist-2023/#detect-when-sticky-is-active\">sticky detection</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In the works</h2>\n<p>And then there’s other stuff already partially implemented that I can’t wait to get better support.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day84/\">@property</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day56/\">container size and style queries</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day38/\">dvh</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day6/\">has()</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day92/\">relative color syntax</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe we have no right to complain.

    "partialText": "<p>Scott O'Hara wrote a <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html\">fantastic blog post about the details and summary elements</a> last year. He explains that there are a lot of oddities and inconsistencies, and he backs his statements with <a href=\"https://codepen.io/scottohara/pen/aaJXYG\">detailed testing</a>.</p><p>To better understand the extent of these oddities and inconsistencies, I did <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/XWxNxyg?editors=1100\">my own testing</a> (not as detailed as Scott's), and here's what I found:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Announcements are very different across different screen readers/browsers. It goes from little information (“show more” in VoiceOver on iOS) to too much information (“Right pointing triangle, Show more, collapsed, summary, group” in Firefox on macOs)</li>\n<li>Removing or changing the triangle doesn’t seem to affect any screen reader/browser pairing except Firefox with all tested screen readers.</li>\n<li>Voice Over macOS Chrome/Edge/Arc, Voice Over macOS Safari, and Talkback Android Chrome provide the most consistent experience.</li>\n<li>Voice Over iOS Safari is also very consistent but in a bad way. It doesn’t announce any role or state.</li>\n<li>Details only expands in Chrome, Arc, Edge when you search with <kbd>CMD</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (find-in-page).</li>\n<li>To remove the triangle in Safari, you must set <code>::-webkit-details-marker</code> to <code>display: none</code>. <br><code>::marker</code> or <code>list-style: none;</code> don't work.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What should you do with this information?</p>\n<p>I don't know, probably test with users?! I'll just quote Scott here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your goal is to create an absolutely consistent disclosure widget behavior across browsers, i.e., ensuring that all <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>s are exposed as expand/collapse buttons, then you’d be better off creating your own using JavaScript and the necessary ARIA attributes. You’d lose out on the find-in-page functionality that the native disclosure widget provides… but depending on the type of disclosure widget you’re creating, you may actually want that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<style>\n  .nomarker summary {\n  list-style-type: none;\n}\n.nomarker2 summary::marker,\n.nomarker2 summary::-webkit-details-marker {\n  content: \"\";\n}\n.custommarker

    "title": "CSS! CSS! CSS!",
    "partialText": "<p>I just came home after three beautiful days in Amsterdam, where I gave a talk at the CSS Day conference. I’ve watched many inspirational and engaging presentations and had many interesting conversations. My biggest takeaway: <strong>The CSS community needs you!</strong></p><p>First things first: <a href=\"https://cssday.nl/2023\">CSS Day</a> is a wonderful event, and the community is lovely. If you can, consider attending it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nerdy.dev/\">Adam Argyle</a> was the MC on the first day, and after every talk, he chanted, <strong>“CSS! CSS! CSS!“</strong>. It was silly but funny. It was Adam’s way of showing appreciation for how far we’ve come with the language and how powerful it is.</p>\n<p>After the first day, I was chatting about CSS in a bar with some friends. Stephan said it’s great that browsers are shipping so many new features, but we need people to use them in real projects, share their experiences in talks and articles, and show the world what CSS is capable of.<br />\nI agree because most of us still need to understand how groundbreaking some of these additions to the language are. That can only change if we’re curious and experiment, share what we’ve learned, and discuss it, but it’s not enough to rely on people like Stephanie Eckles, Ahmad Shadeed, Michelle Barker, Adam Argyle, Bramus Van Damme, Una Kravets, or Kevin Powell to do that. Especially with CSS-Tricks dying slowly*, we need more people to give CSS a stage.<br />\nWe also agreed that we need more people to push CSS to its limits and explore what else we can get from Grid, custom properties, :has(), container queries, etc., beyond the obvious use cases.</p>\n<p>That’s where I ask you a favour: <strong>Please write more about CSS.</strong> Show us what you’ve built and how you build it. The CSS community needs more voices, ideas, and solutions.</p>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of Unas Talk. Her on the left on the right a slide that says &#039;organize a css meetup/event&#039;\" height=\"491\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2023/css-css-css/a596ee439f-1698950547/csscsscss.jpg\" width=\"873\">\n<p>That's not the only favour I have to ask you. </p>\n<p>In her talk, Una Kravets informed us that there's only 1 CSS conference. <a href=\"https://dev.events/\">dev.events</a> currently lists 53 JavaScript and 0 CSS events for the rest of the year. How is that possible?<br />\nMy friends Björn and Jan started the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/css-in-vienna/\">CSS-in-Vienna</a> meetup several years ago and I absolutely love it. Meeting with like-minded folks regularly and talking about CSS is fun, helpful, and motivating. We need more conferences and meetups that focus on CSS.</p>\n<p>The second favour I have to ask you is to <strong>organize a CSS event in your hometown</strong>!</p>\n<p>If you've written an article about CSS or if you are organizing an event, send me a link, and I'll share it!</p>\n<p><em>* I’m usually not a pessimist, but I don’t see how CSS-Tricks could get back on its feet, and I fear that it could meet a <a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/p/dont-sell-your-indie-business-to\">similar fate like scotch.io</a> which also got acquired by Digital Ocean.</em></p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CCSS%21+CSS%21+CSS%21%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Syntax podcast episode 623: “Nothing in CSS” errata",
    "partialText": "<p>I just listened to the Syntax podcast for the first time because they were discussing topics near and dear to my heart, HTML and CSS. The episode is called “Nothing in CSS - 0 vs 0px, no, none, hidden, initial and unset”, and they’re talking about all the things that can be 0, none, or hidden in CSS and HTML. Super interesting stuff, but unfortunately, they got some things wrong. The don‘t have a comment section, so I’m commenting on the episode here in case someone else gets confused by their misinformation.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I don't want to shame them; we're all humans and make mistakes, but their podcast reaches many people, and I feel like I can't keep their statements uncommented.</p>\n<h2>4:15 visibility hidden and screen readers</h2>\n<p>Wes said, as opposed to <code>display: none</code> <q><code>visibility: hidden</code> is not hidden from screen readers</q> and he suggested to add <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> to make sure these elements are hidden from screen readers.<br />\nYou don't have to add the attribute because <code>visibility: hidden</code> already removes an element from the accessibility tree.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/syntax-errata.jpg\" alt=\"Dev Tools accessibility panel showing that a visibility: hidden element is not exposed to the accessibility tree\" /></p>\n<h2>4:35 opacity: 0</h2>\n<p>Wes then continued and said, <q>If you put <code>opacity: 0</code>, [...], that's kinda the same thing as <code>visibility: hidden</code>.</q>.<br />\nNot really, they're different because an element with <code>opacity</code> set to <code>0</code> is still accessible to screen readers. Also, interactive items within an element with <code>visibility</code> set to <code>hidden</code> are not focusable. On the other hand, items within an element with <code>opacity</code> set to <code>0</code> are.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div:focus-within {\n  visibility: visible !important;\n  opacity: 1 !important; \n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;!-- div never visible because the button is not focusable --&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"visibility: hidden\"&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;nope&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- div visible when the button is focused --&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"opacity: 0\"&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;yep&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<h2>10:30 ghost spaces</h2>\n<p>Wes suggests two solutions to get around the “issue” where you have two images and want them to be in one line visually but without the <em>ghost space</em>, or how I like to call them: <em>space</em>, that gets added automatically.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Remove the space in HTML.</strong><br />\nI’d consider that a bad practice because you shouldn’t rely on the position of your tags within your document for styling.</li>\n<li><strong>Set the font size of a parent element to 0 and reset it on the element</strong><br />\nSetting the font size to 0 solely for layout purposes is also a bad practice. That can confuse anyone else who works on the same code base and mess with accessibility and inheritance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to align elements horizontally, use Flexbox.</p>\n<h2>11:45 border</h2>\n<p>Scott said that <code>border: 0</code> and <code>border: none</code> are effectively doing the same thing.<br />\nThat's not entirely true. <code>border</code> is a shorthand property, and <code>border: 0</code> sets the <code>border-width</code> property to <code>0</code> while <code>border: none</code> sets the <code>border-style</code> property to <code>none</code>.</p>\n<h2>14:10 none and 0 in color functions</h2>\n<p>Scott explains how there's no difference between using 0 or none in color functions. I'm not a color expert, but what he said sounded wrong, so I did what they should've done; I read the specs.<br />\n0 represents the amount 0, while none represents a missing color component. A <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#missing\">missing component</a> behaves as a zero value unless you interpolate it. Let me just quote the spec here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n“In the course of converting the two colors to the interpolation color space, any missing components will be replaced with the value 0.  \nThus, the first stage in interpolating two colors is to classify any missing components in the input colors, and compare them to the components of the interpolation color space. If any analogous missing components are found, they will be carried forward and re-inserted in the converted color before linear interpolation takes place.”\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n“If a color with a carried forward missing component is interpolated with another color which is not missing that component, the missing component is treated as having the other color’s component value.”\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the following example, you can see how <code>.none</code> and <code>.zero</code> are different. <code>.none</code> and <code>.value</code> are the same because <code>.none</code> uses the h color component from <code>--color-a</code>.</p>\n<style>\n.none0 {\n  display: flex;\n  min-block-size: 100px;\n  --color-a: oklch(78.3% 0.108 200);\n  --color-b-l: 39.2%;\n  --color-b-c: 0.4;\n}\n.none0 > * {\n  flex-grow: 1;\n}\n.none {\n  background-color: color-mix( in oklch, var(--color-a), oklch(var(--color-b-l) var(--color-b-c) none));\n}\n.zero {\n  background-color: color-mix( in oklch, var(--color-a), oklch(var(--color-b-l) var(--color-b-c) 0));\n}\n.value {\n  background-color: color-mix( in oklch, var(--color-a), oklch(var(--color-b-l) var(--color-b-c) 200));\n}\n</style>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.none0 {\n  --color-a: oklch(78.3% 0.108 200);\n  --color-b-l: 39.2%;\n  --color-b-c: 0.4;\n}\n\n.none {\n  background-color: color-mix( in oklch, var(--color-a), oklch(var(--color-b-l) var(--color-b-c) none));\n}\n\n.zero {\n  background-color: color-mix( in oklch, var(--color-a), oklch(var(--color-b-l) var(--color-b-c) 0));\n}\n\n.value {\n  background-color: color-mix( in oklch, var(--color-a), oklch(var(--color-b-l) var(--color-b-c) 200));\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"none0\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"none\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"zero\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"value\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<div class=\"none0\">\n  <div class=\"none\"></div>\n  <div class=\"zero\"></div>\n  <div class=\"value\"></div>\n</div>\n<h2>23:40 unset and initial</h2>\n<p>Scott explains unset and initial like that: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>unset</code> will revert to the inherited value and it will ignore anything set directly on the element itself, where <code>initial</code> will revert back to the browser default itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He explains it some more and then they summarize it by saying that <code>unset</code> inherits a value and <code>initial</code> reverts to the default browser styles. Both statements are wrong.</p>\n<p>It's true that <code>unset</code> resets a property to its inherited value, but only if the property naturally inherits from its parent. If not, it uses its initial value.</p>\n<p><code>initial</code> sets the value of the property to its <em>initial value</em>. Each property has an <em>initial value</em>, defined in the property’s definition table. For example, if you look at the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-color/#the-color-property\">color property in the specification</a>, you see that the defined initial value in the definition table is <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-color/#css-system-colors\">CanvasText</a>.<br />\n<strong>The initial value is not the default value of the property</strong> defined in the user agent (browser). For example, the default margin of the body in most (all?) browsers is <code>8px</code>, but the initial value of the margin property is <code>0</code>.</p>\n<p>I explain that in detail in <a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day63/\">Day 63: explicit defaulting with inherit, initial, unset, and revert</a>.</p>\n<h2>29:40 role=none</h2>\n<p>Scott and Wes tried to explain what <code>role=none</code> does by explaining what <code>role=button</code> does.</p>\n<p>Wes said <q>I know that this is just a regular old div and this is just ignored by screen readers…</q></p>\n<p>The div is not ignored by screen readers, it just has no semantic meaning. Screen reader users can still read the text. A div is not very different to a paragraph.<br />\nHe continues with:</p>\n<p><q>…but if I put a role equals button, it will show the browsers and screen readers ‘okay, this is something that's clickable and should be focusable‘.</q></p>\n<p>I found that statement confusing. To be clear: <code>role=button</code> doesn't add any interactivity; it only gives the element a semantic role. You need <code>tabindex=\"0\"</code> to make it focusable.</p>\n<p>They also use <code>input</code> as an example of an element where you might want to use <code>role=none</code>, but according to the spec <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#conflict_resolution_presentation_none\">user agents must ignore <code>role=none</code> and <code>role=presentation</code> on interactive elements</a>.</p>\n<h2>30:34 honeypot technique and screen readers</h2>\n<p>Scott and Wes discussed whether <code>role=none</code> would be a good fit for the honey pot technique in forms.</p>\n<p>You don't want to use <code>role=none</code> for hiding form inputs because it has no effect when applied to the element directly. Applied to a parent, it probably doesn't do what you expect. Instead, you want <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> because this removes an element from the accessibility tree, but you must not use <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> on interactive elements or elements that contain interactive elements.<br />\nLong story short: don't use either, and maybe also avoid the honeypot technique.</p>\n<h2>32:30 boolean, keyword and enumerated attributes</h2>\n<p>Wes said <q>With all HTML attributes, except for ARIA attributes, the simple existence of the attribute will make it true.</q>.  </p>\n<p>That's only true for boolean attributes in HTML, not keyword and enumerated attributes. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div contenteditable=\"false\"&gt;Not editable&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You can read more about that in Hidde's post <a href=\"https://hidde.blog/boolean-attributes-in-html-and-aria-whats-the-difference/\">Boolean attributes in HTML and ARIA: what's the difference?</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bonus</h2>\n<p>Since I'm already doing this, I thought I'd add some general comments.</p>\n<h3>4:48 visiblity: hidden transition</h3>\n<p>Scott said <q>You can't really fade-in <code>visibility: hidden</code></q>. That's true, but it is animatable, meaning you can combine it with <code>transform</code> or <code>opacity</code>.</p>\n<h3>27:55 user-scaleable: no</h3>\n<p>It's true that <code>user-scaleable: no</code> <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2022/please-stop-disabling-zoom/\">prevents users from zooming</a>, but only on some mobile browsers.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CSyntax+podcast+episode+623%3A+%E2%80%9CNothing+in+CSS%E2%80%9D+errata%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Day 101: scoping",
    "partialText": "<p>Similar to container queries or cascade layers, we have another new impactful feature in CSS: scoping.</p><p>Let's start nice and easy by reading the <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-6/#scoped-styles\">spec</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A scope is a subtree or fragment of a document, which can be used by selectors for more targeted matching. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>More targeted matching</em> sounds great. We can use the <code>@scope</code> rule to scope styles of a child to a parent selector.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n      the cascade is unavoidable\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope(.card) { \n  .content {\n    border: 5px solid red;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Okay, cool, but we could do that already, right? By combining selectors, we can scope a child to a parent.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.card .content {\n  border: 5px solid red;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The biggest difference in this simple example is that the cascade prioritizes declarations with a more proximate scoping root, regardless of specificity or source order.<br />\nThe background color will be blue in the following example because of the order of appearance.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.card .content {\n  background-color: green;\n}\n\n.wrapper .content {\n  background-color: blue;\n}\n\n/* -&gt; blue */</code></pre>\n<p>In the following example, it's green because before the order of appearance can say anything, scope proximity compares declarations that appear in style rules with different scoping roots and picks the declaration with the fewest generational or sibling-element hops between the scoping root (<code>.card</code> or <code>.wrapper</code>) and the scoped style rule subject (<code>.content</code>). In other words: the cascade prioritizes declarations with a more proximate scoping root.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (.card) {\n  .content {\n    background: green;\n  }\n}\n\n@scope (.wrapper) {\n  .content {\n    background: blue;\n  }\n}\n\n/* -&gt; green */</code></pre>\n<p>There's more to proximity than that, but we'll save that for another day.</p>\n<p>That's not everything. <code>@scope</code> allows us to define scope limits, which I'll cover on another day. That's where it gets really interesting, but before we can talk about that, here are a couple of things to note:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nSelectors within a scoped style rule can only match elements that are in scope, but this applies only to the subject (the actual selector that matches the element). Any other selector in the selector list can be out of scope.\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">  @scope(.card) { \n    /* \n      `.content` (the subject) must be in scope\n      `body` is not in scope and doesn't have to\n    */\n    body &amp; .content {\n      border: 5px solid red;\n    }\n  }</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\nSelectors within a scope block are relative to the scope.\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">  @scope(.card) { \n    /* \n      works with the markup structure at the beginning \n      of this post because it selects `.card .content` \n    */\n    .content {\n    }\n\n    /* \n      doesn't work because it selects \n      `.card .card .content` \n    */\n    .card .content {\n\n    }\n  }</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li> \n<p>Unlike Nesting, selectors within an scoped style rule do not acquire the specificity of any parent selector(s) in the <code>@scope</code> prelude.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">  @scope(.card) { \n    /* the specificity of .content is (0, 1, 0) */\n    .content {\n    }\n  }</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To try out <code>@scope</code> you have to download <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/\">Chrome Canary</a> and enable the <code>Experimental Web Platform features </code> flag in chrome://flags/.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+101%3A+scoping%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

That can also easily happen to you when you structure your CSS in layers for the first time. I can explain why.</p>\n<p>Let's say we have three layers (base, components, and utility) and three rules, one in each layer. It doesn't matter whether you have 3, 30, or 300 rules. The underlying principle I'm trying to explain applies regardless of the size of your CSS.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;\n  E-Mail\n&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"email\" class=\"form__input--error u-no-shadow\" aria-invalid=\"true\" required id=\"email\"&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@layer base {\n  input {\n    --_border-color: #000;\n\n    border: 3px solid var(--_border-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);\n   }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  .form__input--error {\n    --_border-color: #F00;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer utility {\n  .u-no-shadow {\n    box-shadow: none !important;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n  label {\n    display: block;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  input {\n    display: block;\n    padding: 0.4em;\n  }\n  @layer base {\n  .demo1 input {\n    --_border-color: #000;\n    border: 3px solid var(--_border-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);\n }\n}\n@layer components {\n  .demo1 .form__input--error {\n    --_border-color: #F00;\n  }\n}\n@layer utility {\n  .demo1 .u-no-shadow {\n    box-shadow: none !important;\n  }\n}\n.demo2   input {\n    --_border-color: #000;\n    border: 3px solid var(--_border-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);\n }\n .demo2   .form__input--error {\n    --_border-color: #F00;\n  }\n  .demo2   .u-no-shadow {\n    box-shadow: none !important;\n  }\n  .demo3 input[type=\"text\"],\n.demo3 input[type=\"email\"] {\n  --_border-color: #000;\n  border: 3px solid var(--_border-color);\n  box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);\n}\n.demo3 [aria-invalid=\"true\"] {\n  --_border-color: #F00;\n}\n.demo3 .u-no-shadow {\n  box-shadow: none;\n}\n@layer base {\n  .demo4 input[type=\"text\"],\n  .demo4 input[type=\"email\"] {\n    --_border-color: #000;\n    border: 3px solid var(--_border-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);\n  }\n}\n@layer components {\n  .demo4 [aria-invalid=\"true\"] {\n    --_border-color: #F00;\n  }\n}\n@layer utility {\n  .demo4 .u-no-shadow {\n    box-shadow: none;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n<p>You can see how the input field has a red border and no shadow.</p>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\" class=\"demo1\">\n<label for=\"email\">\n  E-Mail\n</label>\n<input type=\"email\" class=\"form__input--error u-no-shadow\" size=\"30\" required aria-invalid=\"true\" id=\"email\">\n</div>\n<p>If we remove the layers, the input field still looks the same.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">input {\n  --_border-color: #000;\n\n  border: 3px solid var(--_border-color);\n  box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);\n}\n\n.form__input--error {\n  --_border-color: #F00;\n}\n\n.u-no-shadow {\n  box-shadow: none !important;\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\" class=\"demo2\">\n<label for=\"email2\">\n  E-Mail\n</label>\n<input type=\"email\" class=\"form__input--error u-no-shadow\" size=\"30\" required aria-invalid=\"true\" id=\"email2\">\n</div>\n<p>Strange, right? Now the question arises what the actual purpose of cascade layers is.<br />\nLet's have a look at the <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-5/#layering\">spec</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Authors can create layers to represent element defaults, third-party libraries, themes, components, overrides, and other styling concerns—and are able to re-order the cascade of layers in an explicit way, <strong>without altering selectors or specificity within each layer, or relying on order of appearance to resolve conflicts across layers</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aha! Now it makes much more sense why we don’t see any difference. If you analyse the CSS, you’ll know that we’ve altered selectors and specificity so that we don’t have any conflicts with the order of appearance.</p>\n<p>We deliberately keep the specificity of our reset and base styles low to avoid issues with our component styles.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">input { }</code></pre>\n<p>We ensure that the specificity in our components is larger than in our base styles, and we keep the specificity flat (single-class selectors only).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.form__input--error { }</code></pre>\n<p>We use <code>!important</code> to ensure that certain styles will <s>always</s> most of the time have precedence over other styles.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.u-no-shadow {\n  box-shadow: none !important;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>That’s fine, but it’s a hack because we’re restricting ourselves from using one of the most valuable features in CSS: selectors.<br />\nCSS offers many practical ways of selecting elements. The complexity of the Cascade shouldn’t keep us from using them.<br />\nCascade Layers allow us to be more expressive with our selectors without worrying too much about their specificity. If we rewrite the CSS and use more explicit base styles, semantic selectors in our component styles, and no <code>!important</code> in our utilities, we get this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">input[type=\"text\"],\ninput[type=\"email\"] {\n  --_border-color: #000;\n\n  border: 3px solid var(--_border-color);\n  box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);\n}\n\n[aria-invalid=\"true\"] {\n  --_border-color: #F00;\n}\n\n.u-no-shadow {\n  box-shadow: none;\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\" class=\"demo3\">\n<label for=\"email3\">\n  E-Mail\n</label>\n<input type=\"email\" class=\"u-no-shadow\" size=\"30\" required aria-invalid=\"true\" id=\"email3\">\n</div>\n<p>We're running into specificity issues. The colour of the border should be red, and there should be no shadow.<br />\nThat's where Cascade Layers can help. Our rules are scoped to each layer, and layers defined later in the document have precedence over layers defined earlier, regardless of the selectors used.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@layer base {\n  input[type=\"text\"],\n  input[type=\"email\"] {\n    --_border-color: #000;\n\n    border: 3px solid var(--_border-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  [aria-invalid=\"true\"] {\n    --_border-color: #F00;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer utility {\n  .u-no-shadow {\n    box-shadow: none;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\" class=\"demo4\">\n<label for=\"email4\">\n  E-Mail\n</label>\n<input type=\"email\" class=\"u-no-shadow\" size=\"30\" required aria-invalid=\"true\" id=\"email4\">\n</div>\n<p>Tools like Cascade Layers and the <code>:where()</code> pseudo-class enable us to write more expressive CSS and use the language’s full range of selectors. For these tools to show their power, you can’t just drop them into your stylesheets and hope for magic to happen, you have to adapt how you think about the Cascade and how you write CSS.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CCascade+Layers+are+useless%2A%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

They use the following code for hiding links visually:\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.skip-links a:not(:focus) {\n    overflow: hidden;\n    width: 0;\n    height: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    border: 0;\n    margin: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-intro\">\nAs it turns out, links are not focusable in Safari if they have 0 dimensions.

    "title": "Pros and cons of using Shadow DOM and style encapsulation",
    "partialText": "<p>When I started to work with web components, I compared different options and decided to go with <a href=\"https://lit.dev\">lit</a>. I knew the extra performance cost would pay off quickly, and it fit into my performance budget. I’m still happy with my decision.</p><style>\n  .pro {\n    color: green;\n  }\n  .con {\n    color: red;\n  }\n</style>\n<p>I was new to web components and lit, so I had to consult the docs quite often. On the <a href=\"https://lit.dev/docs/components/shadow-dom/\">page about Shadow DOM</a> it says: </p>\n<div class=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rendering into children and not shadow DOM is generally not recommended. Your element will not have access to DOM or style scoping, and it will not be able to compose elements into its internal DOM.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>To affirm that, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM\">Using shadow DOM</a> page on MDN says:</p>\n<div class=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>An important aspect of web components is encapsulation — being able to keep the markup structure, style, and behavior hidden and separate from other code on the page so that different parts do not clash, and the code can be kept nice and clean.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>That confirmed my perception of how web components work: they go hand in hand with Shadow DOM. I thought that's the USP (unique selling point), so I used it in almost every component I built.   </p>\n<p>Nearly a year later, after fighting many problems and annoyances, I wondered whether Shadow DOM was actually that useful. So I <a href=\"https://front-end.social/@matuzo/110904820573072435\">posted this on Mastodon</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>After almost a year working with web components I'm starting to doubt the usefulness of style encapsulation and shadow DOM in general.</p>\n<p>Styling and some accessibility stuff is so much easier without…</p>\n<blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>To my surprise, many people replied that they agreed, default to light DOM, and only opt-in when it makes sense. I'm glad because it confirmed my feeling and encouraged me to rethink and restructure some of the components I built. Shadow DOM has its justification but does not always have to be the first choice.</p>\n<p>To help you make similar decisions, I summarized my pros and cons of Shadow DOM and style encapsulation. Please note that I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who, first and foremost, cares about accessibility and well-structured, semantic HTML. For me, JavaScript is an optional add-on and not the foundation of my code. That implies that I might not have to solve the same problems as others who primarily work with JS-heavy websites. That might also explain why my list of cons is longer than the list of pros.</p>\n<p>Here's a collection on CodePen with <a href=\"https://codepen.io/collection/zxJjoj\">all the demos in this post</a>.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#pro-style-encapsulation\"><span class=\"pro\">Pro:</span> Style encapsulation</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#pro-dom-encapsulation\"><span class=\"pro\">Pro:</span> DOM encapsulation</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#pro-slots\"><span class=\"pro\">Pro:</span> Slots</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-style-encapsulation\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Style “encapsulation”</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-styling-slotted-content\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Styling slotted content</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-styling-nested-slotted-content\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Styling nested slotted content</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-selecting-slotted-content\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Selecting slotted content</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-broken-references\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Broken references</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-javascript-dependency\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> JavaScript dependency</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-fouce\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> FOUCE (Flash of unstyled custom element)</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-forms-behave-differently\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Forms behave differently</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-missing-global-styles\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Missing global styles</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-debugging-a11y\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Debugging with accessibility testing tools</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"#con-debugging-a11y2\"><span class=\"con\">Con:</span> Debugging with DevTools</a>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"pro-style-encapsulation\"><span class=\"pro\">Pro:</span> Style encapsulation</h2>\n<p>When you build components that others use in environments where you have no access or control over light DOM styles, style encapsulation can be immensely helpful. You provide devs who work with your components with one or more JS files that contain all the structure and styles needed to make your custom element display and work just as you intended. If there are new versions of a component, they don't have to worry too much about the structure and the classes used because everything's neatly hidden in its own DOM. They only have to replace the JavaScript files.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://front-end.social/@dutchcelt@mastodon.social/110914690188092126\">Egor, for example, replied</a> to my post on Mastodon:</p>\n<div class=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>I almost can’t work without them when creating a library of components, and I have no access to the document(light dom) styles. I’m working on a project requiring components in React, Angular, and Blazor.  Web Components make that possible.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>In cases like that, when you work on a design system and don't know who's using your components, combined with which external stylesheets, and in which environment, style encapsulation makes a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>Here's an example: a paragraph in light DOM and one in shadow DOM of a web component. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;p&gt;\n  Hello World!\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;cus-tom&gt;\n  Hello encapsulated World!\n&lt;/cus-tom&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">p {\n  border: 4px dotted aqua;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The paragraph within the component is not affected by global styles and comes with its own styles that don't affect the outside.</p>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\" class=\"demo1\">\n<p>\n  Hello World!\n</p>\n<cus-tom>\n  Hello encapsulated World!\n</cus-tom>\n</div>\n<script>\nclass Custom1 extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n    let style = document.createElement('style');\n    style.textContent= `\n      p {\n        font-family: Comic Sans MS;\n      }\n    `\n    let content = document.createElement('p');\n    content.innerHTML = `<slot></slot>`\n    this.shadowRoot.append(style)\n    this.shadowRoot.append(content)\n  }\n}\ncustomElements.define('cus-tom', Custom1);\n</script>\n<style>\n  .demo1 p {\n    border: 4px dotted aqua;\n  }\n</style>\n<p>You only pass text to the web component and it returns a styled paragraph.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">class Custom1 extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\n    let style = document.createElement('style');\n    style.textContent= `\n      p {\n        font-family: Comic Sans MS;\n      }\n    `\n\n    let content = document.createElement('p');\n    content.innerHTML = `&lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;`\n\n    this.shadowRoot.append(style)\n    this.shadowRoot.append(content)\n  }\n}\n\ncustomElements.define('cus-tom', Custom1);</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"pro-dom-encapsulation\"><span class=\"pro\">Pro:</span> DOM encapsulation</h2>\n<p>Similar to style encapsulation, with Shadow DOM, you also get DOM encapsulation, which can be helpful.</p>\n<p>In the following demo, you can see how it says there are only three buttons on the page, but there are actually four.

    "partialText": "<p>There are different ways of selecting the scoping root inside a <code>@scope</code> rule.</p><p>When you use the <code>:scope</code> pseudo-class in a stylesheet, it matches the <code>:root</code> element.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:root {\n  border: 10px solid red;\n}\n\n:scope {\n  border-color: blue;\n}\n\n/* -&gt; 10px blue border on the &lt;html&gt; element */</code></pre>\n<p>When you use it inside a scope rule, it matches the rule's scoping root.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div class=\"wrapper\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n      the cascade is unavoidable\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (.wrapper) {\n  :scope {\n    border: 5px solid red;\n  }\n}\n\n/* -&gt; 5px red border on the .wrapper element */</code></pre>\n<p>Selectors inside a scope rule can only match elements that are in scope. Selecting <code>.content</code> within the <code>.wrapper</code> scope works:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (.wrapper) {\n  .content {\n    background: aqua;\n  }\n}\n\n/* That's like writing .wrapper .content {} */</code></pre>\n<p>Selecting <code>.wrapper .content</code> within the <code>.wrapper</code> scope doesn't work:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (.wrapper) {\n  .wrapper .content {\n    background: aqua;\n  }\n}\n\n/* That's like writing .wrapper .wrapper .content {} */</code></pre>\n<p>You can use <code>:scope</code> instead of <code>.wrapper</code>. That works because it doesn't match an element with the class <code>.wrapper</code> inside of <code>.wrapper</code>, but the scoping root itself.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (.wrapper) {\n  :scope .content {\n    background: aqua;\n  }\n}\n\n/* That's like writing .wrapper .content {} */</code></pre>\n<p>Instead of <code>:scope</code>, you can also use <code>&amp;</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (.wrapper) {\n  &amp; {\n    border: 5px solid orange;\n  }\n\n  &amp; .content {\n    background: aqua;\n  }\n}\n\n/* \n  -&gt; 5px orange border on the .wrapper element \n  and aqua background on .content.\n*/</code></pre>\n<p>There are two differences between <code>:scope</code> and <code>&amp;</code> in this context. They're only evident if you have a list of scoping roots.</p>\n<p>The first difference in specificity. <code>:scope</code> has the specificity of a pseudo-class. <code>&amp;</code> takes on the specificity of the most specific selector in the selector list of scoping roots. In the following example <code>:scope</code> overrules <code>&amp;</code> because <code>&amp;</code> has the specificity of a tag selector.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;section id=\"section\"&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;yo!&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/h2&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;yo!&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (section, p) {\n  :scope {\n    border: 10px solid green;\n  }\n\n  &amp; {\n    border: 10px solid red;\n  }\n}\n\n/* -&gt; 10px green border on section and p */</code></pre>\n<p>If you scope the section via its id instead of the tag, <code>&amp;</code> takes on the specificity of an id selector and thus overrules <code>:scope</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (#section, p) {\n  &amp; {\n    border: 10px solid red;\n  }\n\n  :scope {\n    border: 10px solid green;\n  }\n}\n\n/* -&gt; 10px red border on the section and p */</code></pre>\n<p>The second difference is that <code>:scope</code> only matches the scoping root itself. <code>&amp;</code> can match any element that is matched by the selector list. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;yo!&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/h2&gt;\n\n  &lt;p&gt;\n    &lt;span&gt;yo!&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@scope (section, p) {\n  :scope span { background: fuchsia; }\n  /* \n    section span { }\n    p span { }\n\n    -&gt; fuchsia background on span within h2 and p \n  */\n\n  :scope &amp; span { background: aqua; }\n  /* \n    section p span { }\n\n    -&gt; aqua background only on span within p \n  */\n\n  :scope :scope span { background: red }\n  /* \n    Doesn't match any element because `@scope (section, p)` only\n    defines multiple scopes, it doesn't nest them. \n  */\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Essentially, that means that <code>:scope</code> can only match a scoping root and <code>&amp;</code> can match an element in the selector list, regardless of whether it's considered a scoping root in that context. At least, that's how I interpret it. The spec is still pretty fucking hard to read.</p>\n<p>To try out <code>@scope</code> you have to download <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/\">Chrome Canary</a> and enable the <code>Experimental Web Platform features</code> flag in chrome://flags/.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+102%3A+selecting+the+scoping+root%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

There, you can zoom text only instead of the entire page.<br />\nHowever, both settings treat px and rem-based values equally.</p>\n<img alt=\"A popup showing several page settings.

There, you can change the text scaling.</p>\n<p>I did that, and nothing happened on my test page. It did work on my personal site, though,...partially (we'll talk about that later).</p>\n<img alt=\"Text scaled up to 200% in the settings, but the font size didn&#039;t change. demo on the left, settings on the right.\" height=\"562\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2023/how-browsers-zoom-text/f03db0c39a-1699006068/chrome-mobile-settings.webp\" width=\"912\">\n<p>I did some debugging, and I learned that Chrome's text scaling only kicks in when there are at least 122 characters on the page (<a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=For+fucks+sake\">FFS!</a>).</p>\n<p>Retrying the test with more than 122 characters shows that Chrome also treats rem and px-based font sizes equally.</p>\n<img alt=\"Two paragraphs saying Hello World, with Hello repeated 20 times.

It's from February 2023, and according to how they announced the feature, I would've expected it had already landed, but I don't see it on my phone (Pixel 7, Android 13, Chrome 118). </p>\n<p>You can enable it by navigating to <code>chrome://flags</code>, searching for <em>zoom</em>, and enabling <em>Accessibility Page Zoom</em>.

There, you can change the text scaling. It works like the improved text scaling feature in Chrome and treats <code>px</code> and <code>rem</code> equally.</p>\n<img alt=\"Both paragraphs scaled according to the zoom level in the settings.\" height=\"987\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2023/how-browsers-zoom-text/14d907926f-1699006068/firefox-mobile-settings.webp\" width=\"912\">\n<h2>So what?</h2>\n<p>Nothing, keep using <code>rem</code>. People will benefit from it. It's just good to know that some (most?) operating systems and browsers do their own thing. Ultimately, it doesn't matter how browsers zoom text; what matters is that users can use that feature and that you build interfaces that respect user preferences. Part of that is working with relative units like rem.</p>\n<p>One more thing: it's absolutely possible I'm wrong about some things because I don't know the ins and outs of all mobile operating systems and browsers.

    "title": "Not all automated testing tools support Shadow DOM in web components",
    "partialText": "<p>There isn't much more to say; it's all in the title.</p>\n<p>Many automated testing tools are a collection of JavaScript functions you run on a page. Most of those rely on querying the DOM. If a tool doesn't consider shadow trees, it only catches accessibility errors in the Light DOM, which may give you a wrong sense of safety and potentially affect your users.</p><style>\n  tbody td {\n    background: green;\n    color: #fff;\n  }\n  td.no {\n    background: #bf0404;\n  }\n  td.noish {\n    background: #bf8504;\n  }\n</style>\n<p>That's one more reason <a href=\"/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/\">not to rely on automated testing only</a>.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean you shouldn't use automated testing if your site contains web components. You just have to ensure that the tool you're using supports them. A good way of doing that is creating a simple component that contains some accessibility bugs caused by nodes attached to the component's Shadow DOM, like the following component.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;main&gt;\n  &lt;h1 id=\"h1\"&gt;Testing a11y bugs in web components&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n  &lt;a href=\"#el\"&gt;Jump to elem in shadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- Broken skip link --&gt;\n\n  &lt;some-bugs&gt;&lt;/some-bugs&gt;\n&lt;/main&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\nclass SomeBugs extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});\n\n    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `\n    &lt;style&gt;:host { color: #efefef }&lt;/style&gt; &lt;!-- Low contrast. --&gt;\n    &lt;h4 id=\"el\"&gt;Heading&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!-- Skipped heading. --&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"#test\"&gt; &lt;!-- Missing alt. --&gt;\n\n    &lt;button aria-labelledby=\"h1\"&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;!-- Broken ARIA reference/missing accessible name. --&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"input\"&gt; &lt;!-- Missing label. --&gt;\n      `\n  }\n}\n\ncustomElements.define('some-bugs', SomeBugs);\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>CodePen: <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/yLwYNYY?editors=1010\">Test web component containing accessibility bugs</a></p>\n<p>If you add this component to a page, testing tools should find at least five issues. I picked five popular tools: <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\">axe DevTools</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/\">Google Lighthouse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tpgi.com/arc-platform/arc-toolkit/\">ARC Toolkit</a>, <a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/extension/\">WAVE</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/verify/automated/\">IBM Equal Access (IBM EAAC)</a>, and ran them against the component.</p>\n<p>axe DevTools and Lighthouse, both based on axe-core, found all five issues.<br />\nWAVE found no problems in Shadow DOM, but reported a broken skip link in Light DOM. WAVE and ARC are the only tools that check for broken anchor links. Arguably, because it’s not an obvious accessibility issue or WCAG violation, but according to the Web Aim 1 Million report, <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/#skip\">one out of every six skip links</a> on tested sites that contained skip links were broken. They should check whether targets of anchor links exist.<br />\nIBM EA found all issues except the skipped heading, which can be considered a bad practice and not a violation, which IBM EA doesn't report anyway, regardless of the type of DOM.<br />\nARC Toolkit found all issues except the low contrast text color of the heading.</p>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\" aria-labelledby=\"form1\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"region\" style=\"width: 100%; grid-column: 4 / -4\">\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n  <caption id=\"form1\">Comparison of issues reported in different testing tools</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bug</td>\n      <th>axe</th>\n      <th>WAVE</th>\n      <th>ARC</th>\n      <th>IBM EAAC</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Detected issues</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td class=\"no\">1</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Broken label/input</th>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td class=\"no\">no</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Broken ARIA</th>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td class=\"no\">no</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Missing alt</th>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td class=\"no\">no</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Skipped heading</th>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td class=\"no\">no</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td class=\"no\">no</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Low contrast</th>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td class=\"no\">no</td>\n      <td class=\"no\">no</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">Broken anchor link</th>\n      <td class=\"noish\" aria-describedby=\"note\">no*</td>\n      <td>yes</td>\n      <td>Yes</td>\n      <td class=\"noish\" aria-describedby=\"note\">no*</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p id=\"note\">*not a direct accessibility concern, but should be checked.</p> \n<p>When I published this post, ARC didn't support Shadow DOM, but it does since early May 2024 with version 5.7.0. I'm not aware if testing Shadow DOM is on WAVE's roadmap, but in the meantime, I'd recommend not using the tool for sites that contain web components or using another tool to double-check.</p>\n<p>The same applies to HTML validators. The official <a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/\">W3C validator</a>, for example, doesn't support Shadow DOM. </p>\n<h2>Update 04.01.24</h2>\n<p>Added info about ARC's plans to support Shadow DOM in early 2024.</p>\n<h2>Update 08.01.24</h2>\n<p>Added clarification about the broken skip link bug.</p>\n<h2>Update 17.05.24</h2>\n<p>Starting with version 5.7.0, <a href=\"https://www.tpgi.com/arc-toolkit-5-7-0/\">Arc Toolkit now supports Shadow DOM</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update 19.05.25</h2>\n<p>WAVE still doesn't support Shadow DOM.</p>\n<p>The Firefox and <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/taba11y-tab-order-accessi/aocppmckdocdjkphmofnklcjhdidgmga?hl=en\">Chrome extension taba11y</a> is another tool that doesn't support Shadow DOM.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CNot+all+automated+testing+tools+support+Shadow+DOM+in+web+components%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>Following <a href=\"/blog/2023/css-wish-list\">last year</a>, I created a CSS wishlist for 2024.</p><p>Before I get into the details, I have to say that creating a wishlist almost feels wrong because there are more features in CSS today than I could have ever wished for. So, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who contributed to CSS being where it is today: spec writers, invited experts, browser developers, everyone involved in Interop 202*, dev rels, bloggers, and people who report bugs and contribute to discussions about new and existing features. Thank you very much!</p>\n<h2>Container Style Queries</h2>\n<p>We <strong>need</strong> container style queries in all browsers. They will change how we write CSS and make our stylesheets more flexible, scalable, and robust. You can read why I believe that on the <a href=\"https://12daysofweb.dev/2023/container-style-queries/\">12 Days of Web</a>, or you can watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/L668dK6wFcM?t=1411\">my talk from last year's CSS Day</a>.</p>\n<p>Current support: Chrome/Edge 111+</p>\n<h2>Scope</h2>\n<p>I understand how someone can be skeptical about the usefulness of <a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day101\">scoping</a>, but trust me, once you learn how it works and what it can do for you, you'll also be convinced it's another missing piece in the puzzle.</p>\n<p>Current support: Chrome/Edge 118+, Safari TP</p>\n<h2>Mixins</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9350\">Mixins in native CSS</a>? Yes, please!</p>\n<p>Current support: none</p>\n<h2>State Queries</h2>\n<p>State queries will allow us to query when something is in a specific state, like sticky. Here's an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkBeBxs48os&amp;t=1026s\">early demo</a> presented by Una.</p>\n<p>Current support: none</p>\n<h2>Gammut Mapping</h2>\n<p>I was disappointed to learn that <a href=\"https://front-end.social/@leaverou/111491942156530717\">there's no real gamut mapping in oklch/oklab</a>. I hope browser vendors listen to the <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9449\">feedback from developers</a> and reconsider their decision.</p>\n<h2>Animation of discrete properties</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/oNmKBGo\">transition-behavior</a> property and the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/MWLNJRj?editors=1100\">@starting-style at-rule</a> are super useful because they allow you to animate discrete properties like <code>display</code>. I'd love to see support in all browsers.</p>\n<p>Current support: Chrome/Edge 117+</p>\n<h2>Other wish lists</h2>\n<p>Here are some other 2024 CSS wish lists:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/tylers-css-wish-list-for-2024/\">Tyler Sticka</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://knowler.dev/blog/2024-css-wishlist\">Nathan Knowler</a></li>\n</ul><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CMy+CSS+wish+list+2024%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

The organizer, Marc Thiele, a lovely and special person, has a strong web dev background and affiliation. That's why many talks at his events are about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Still, there are always just as many or even more talks about typography, calligraphy, graphic design, creativity, leadership, and so much more.

He says that you could compare this with a cup that is filled with tea. When pouring milk in it this would happen:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt>replace</dt>\n  <dd>The tea gets removed, and is replaced by the milk.</dd>\n  <dt>add</dt>\n  <dd>The milk gets added to the cup, but it remains layered on top of the tea.</dd>\n  <dt>accumulate</dt>\n  <dd>The milk is added to the tea and, because they are both fluids, they mix nicely.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>“replace” is the default you’re familiar with. “add” makes sense, I guess. To understand the difference between “add” and “accumulate”, you have to animate multiple properties. To illustrate that, I’ll steal <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/css-animation-composition#demo\">another great example from my friend Bramus</a>.</p>\n<p>In the CSS code, all three animations start with <code>transform: translateX(50px) rotate(45deg)</code> and end with <code>transform: translateX(100px)</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.box {\n  transform: translateX(50px) rotate(45deg);\n\n  transform-origin: 50% 50%;\n  animation: adjust 5s linear infinite alternate;\n}\n\n@keyframes adjust {\n  to {\n    transform: translateX(100px);\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"600\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-slug-hash=\"VwGRBVX\" data-pen-title=\"CSS `animation-composition`\" data-user=\"web-dot-dev\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/VwGRBVX\">\n  CSS `animation-composition`</a> by web.dev (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev\">@web-dot-dev</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n<p>Each composition type yields a different result:</p>\n<dl>\n  <dt>replace</dt>\n  <dd><code>translateX(50px) rotate(45deg)</code> is replaced by <code>translateX(100px)</code>. The box moves from 50px to 100px and rotates back to 0deg.</dd>\n  <dt>add</dt>\n  <dd><code>translateX(50px) rotate(45deg)</code> turns into <code>translateX(50px) rotate(45deg) translateX(100px)</code>. The box moves 50px, rotates 45deg, and then moves 100px.</dd>\n  <dt>accumulate</dt>\n  <dd><code>translateX(50px) rotate(45deg)</code> turns into <code>translateX(150px) rotate(45deg)</code>. The 100px is added to the 50px, and the box moves from 50px to 150px and rotates 45deg.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>You may think that the result of using add and accumulate should be the same because the box is moved by 150px on the x-axis in both cases but the order of transform functions matters. They are applied from left to right. With <code>animation-composition: add</code>, the box moves 50px, rotates, and then moves another 100px. With <code>animation-composition: accumulate</code>, it moves 150px and then rotates. If you're curious to learn why exactly the result is different in the end, I suggest you trying reading the <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms-2/#combining-transform-lists\">transforms spec</a>.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDay+109%3A+the+animation-composition+property%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

When we went to the doctor, they told us there wasn't just one baby but two. It sounds cliche, but hearing that news made me feel a rollercoaster of emotions. It went from \"Fuck, my life is over \"to \"OMG, that's so awesome! \".<br />\nAll these thoughts became irrelevant quickly because the doctor told us that the babies shared a placenta and that we should see a specialist at the hospital. There they told us that that's not ideal but not a big issue.<br />\nThere was another problem, though. The babies' umbilical cords were connected through a fine vein, and one baby transferred blood to the other. One baby had too much red blood cells, and the other not enough. The difference wasn't significant, but they told us it could change at any time and that they needed to monitor them closely. That's why we had to go to the hospital every week for six months. They also said that in case it gets worse, we would have to make a decision: Keep both babies and risk that they die or they're both born with a chronic illness or severe disability, or cut one baby's umbilical cord while it's still in the womb and save the other. I cried so much the following weeks and thinking about it makes me tear up again. Every week for 24 weeks, we went to the hospital and waited up to three hours for the doctors to tell us whether we would have to make that decision. That was tough. We tried to stay positive and be there for each other and Hanni. Everything else was secondary.<br />\nFast forward to December, our two beautiful daughters, Olivia and Philippa, were born healthy. There were minor complications, but we were allowed to go home together after five days. Today, everything is fine. They are healthy, beautiful, funny, clever, adorable, wild,…just perfect. I'm the happiest man alive.</p>\n<div class=\"image-grid\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2025/a-year-in-review-2023/4a45fbc07e-1736722142/photo5.webp\"><img alt=\"Me in the hospital comforting my daughters minutes after they were born.\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2025/a-year-in-review-2023/05b3579330-1736722142/photo5_thumb.webp\" width=\"563\"></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2025/a-year-in-review-2023/22d6462197-1736722143/photo6.webp\"><img alt=\"Me holding both babies in baby car seats ready to go home\" height=\"1000\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2025/a-year-in-review-2023/ed6f96d787-1736722143/photo6_thumb.webp\" width=\"563\"></a>\n</div>\n<h2>Work</h2>\n<p>2023 was my first year as a full-time freelancer after working almost exclusively for the City of Vienna for four years. 2023, I still worked for the City but had significantly fewer hours.<br />\nI did some auditing and online and in-person workshops. My favorite workshop was in Hamburg with PPI. The team was great, and I fell in love with the City.

It was such an honor to get invited to speak at CSS Day. I kinda felt out of place because many of the other speakers were people I looked up to.

Generally, we don't get much sleep, but that extra load when they don't sleep all night and need a lot of attention during the day is challenging.

I'm happy and proud that I got to work for ORF and Statista.</p>\n<p>I got a new office in February. It's too big for my needs, but the location is phenomenal.

The timer starts at 0 when the page loads, and starts ticking forwards as clock time progresses. Until recently, that was the only animation timeline we had access to. With <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/scroll-driven-animations\">scroll-driven animations</a>, we get two additional timelines. One of them is connected to the scroll position of a scroll container along a particular axis. To use it, we create an animation as usual, but set the <code>animation-timeline</code> property to <code>scroll()</code>;</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@keyframes progress {\n  0% {\n    --progress: 0%;\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    --progress: 100%;\n  }\n}\n\n.back-to-top {\n  --yellow: oklch(85.33% 0.185 92.12);\n  --white: oklch(100% 0 0);\n\n  background-image: linear-gradient(var(--yellow) 0% var(--progress), var(--white) var(--progress) 100%);\n  /* ... */\n  animation: progress linear;\n  animation-timeline: scroll();\n}</code></pre>\n<p>That looks great, but it doesn't work. The problem is that we're basically trying to <a href=\"/blog/2023/100daysof-day84\">animate strings</a>. We must tell the browser first that <code>--progress</code> represents a <code>&lt;length-percentage&gt;</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@property --progress {\n  syntax: '&lt;length-percentage&gt;';\n  inherits: false;\n  initial-value: 0%;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>And, that's i…no, wait. We forgot to turn the arrow up. We register another custom property and change its value at 2%. We use the property for the rotation of the SVG.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@property --angle {\n  syntax: '&lt;angle&gt;';\n  inherits: true;\n  initial-value: -90deg;\n}\n\n@keyframes progress {\n  0% {\n    --progress: 0%;\n    --angle: 0deg;\n  }\n\n  2% {\n    --angle: -90deg;\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    --progress: 100%;\n  }\n}\n\n.back-to-top svg {\n  /* … */\n  transform: rotate(var(--angle));\n}</code></pre>\n<p><code>animation-timeline</code> is currently <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_animation-timeline\">only supported by Chromium-based browsers</a> and Firefox behind a flag. That doesn't have to bother us because the link still does what it's supposed to do. If you want to, you can use feature detection to show the yellow background color instead of white for browsers that don't support scroll-driven animations.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@supports not (animation-timeline: scroll()) {\n  .back-to-top {\n    background: var(--yellow);\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>To animate the scrolling, use <code>scroll-behavior: smooth</code>, but wrap it in a <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query to ensure it only applies to users with no preference for reduced motion.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@media(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n  html {\n    scroll-behavior: smooth;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Now, that's it. You can see the <a href=\"https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/azoMYWg\">final demo here</a>. I like how simple this solution is and how it doesn't rely on JavaScript. Yeah, CSS! ❤️</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CBuilding+a+progress-indicating+scroll-to-top+button+in+HTML+and+CSS%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "NVDA bug: anchor links broken if they point to a parent element",
    "partialText": "<p>In my <a href=\"/blog/2025/scroll-to-top-button\">last blog post</a>, I explained how to create a back-to-top button that visually indicates the scroll position. I tested it in different browsers to see if the CSS works. I didn't test with screen readers because the HTML was basic and straightforward. There wasn't anything that could go wrong, or at least I thought so.</p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;main id=\"content\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"#content\" class=\"back-to-top\"&gt;\n    Back to top\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/main&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;\n&lt;/footer&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>I posted the <a href=\"https://front-end.social/@matuzo/113922639617414500\">link to the blog post on Mastodon</a>, and <a href=\"https://front-end.social/@jscholes@dragonscave.space/113923783978965250\">James Scholes replied</a>, telling me that NVDA doesn't respond to activating the link in Chrome. The browse mode cursor just stayed at the bottom of the page. <a href=\"https://front-end.social/@cwilcox808@c.im/113924228570291163\">Curtis Wilcox suggested</a> that it may have something to do with the link being a child of the targeted element. I tested it, and he was right. When you use the cursor in NVDA and click an anchor link that points to a parent element, NVDA doesn't respond. It works fine if you use the Tab key. It also works fine if the link is outside the target. It's the same in Chrome and Firefox. I also tested it with JAWS in Chrome and VoiceOver with Safari, and there it works fine.<br />\nI <a href=\"https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/17669\">filed a bug</a>. As it turns out, that's a feature, as James Teh explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This fails because the position of the cursor and the scroll target (which is the entire container) overlap. NVDA doesn't report a scroll if the caret is already within the scroll target, I assume because that could result in double speaking and snapping of the cursor back to the scroll target if the scrolling event fires again. That said, this event really shouldn't fire multiple times. That behaviour was originally implemented back in February 2008 in <a href=\"https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/commit/4ec0dd8fcc919da238a19b792345c89db3ee7bb4\">4ec0dd8</a>. So maybe we can loosen this restriction. I'd suggest we check whether the caret overlaps the first line of the scroll target instead, which should be fairly straightforward to implement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does that mean for you? If possible, move anchor links outside their target until they fix the bug.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;main id=\"content\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/main&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"#content\" class=\"back-to-top\"&gt;\n    Back to top\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/footer&gt;</code></pre><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CNVDA+bug%3A+anchor+links+broken+if+they+point+to+a+parent+element%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>Since Trump took office on Jan. 20 this year, he and his henchman have done many things that bewildered me. I assume that most of you are following the news, so you know what I’m talking about, but here are some things I found especially cruel and disgusting.</p><ul>\n<li>Terminated diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the federal government</li>\n<li>Granted clemency to everyone charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021</li>\n<li>Required trans women to be housed in prisons for men</li>\n<li>Ordered removal of third-gender option on IDs</li>\n<li>Tried to entice federal workers to resign</li>\n<li>Removed thousands of government web pages</li>\n<li>Planned to reduce the work force at U.S.A.I.D. to 290 from more than 10,000</li>\n<li>Blamed Zelensky instead of Putin for the Ukraine war</li>\n<li>Shared an AI video of Gaza developed as a luxury resort</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is just an excerpt from a <a href=\"https://12ft.io/proxy\">long list of actions</a> that the New York Times keeps track of.  </p>\n<p>Every day, I think, <em>“What’s next, and can it get any worse?”</em>. We all know it can. When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_meeting\">Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the Oval Office</a> on Feb. 28 and got bullied by Trump, Vance, and other Trump-adoring fascists, I was speechless. I’m not deeply involved with politics, but I understood that wasn’t normal. Besides the inhuman and vile behavior Zelenskyy had to endure, what Trump did there was a punch in the gut for the Ukranian people. He showed on which side he is and may have sealed the fate of millions. </p>\n<p>For me, that was the <strong>last straw</strong>.</p>\n<p>It’s been a few days, but I can’t stop thinking about what happened. I was filled with rage and desperation when I saw the video because I knew I couldn’t do anything. Talking with friends about the meeting, I got madder and madder, and at some point, I thought, <em>“Okay, if Trump wants to make America great again, then I’ll try to do the opposite: send as little money as possible to the U.S. and only buy European products and services.”</em> I’ve calmed down and realized that’s neither possible nor productive. We must not allow this thug to separate us. Still, something changed in me. </p>\n<p>Many of you have been very considerate about digital rights, access to software, data privacy, and, generally, the political, social, and personal implications of using software and sharing data for a long time. To be honest, I was aware, but I didn’t really care enough until now. This meeting/roast at the Oval Office didn’t just make me think about Europe’s position in the world and its dependency on the United States of America but also my own relationship with the U.S. I asked myself, <em>“How much do I depend on the U.S. and especially on software from the U.S.?“</em>. I probably wouldn’t have had this thought if Pichai (Google), Zuckerberg (Meta), Bezos (Amazon), Chew (TikTok), and Cook (Apple) hadn’t attended Trump’s inauguration.</p>\n<p>Trying to abstain entriely from American software is neither realistic nor productive, but if there’s one thing I took from this event, it’s that I need to be more considerate when picking software. For me, that means going for Free and open-source software (FOSS) and European software first. (First, not only! I have American indy developer friends that I still want to support.) Also, I don’t want to use software and services from <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/american-businesses-supporting-donating-donald-trump-list-2027957\">companies that support or endorse Trump</a> (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Google, Uber, AirBnb, Paypal, X, Vercel,…), which, given my profession, will be impossible, but I want to keep it to a minimum.  I know that many think that is a useless effort, and some talk of double standards when you don't go all-in, and that's fine. You do you. I won't tell you what to do. This is a personal decision I've made.</p>\n<p>Of course, I wasn’t the only one with that epiphany. People have started sharing tips and strategies for moving from software that benefits Trump to alternatives using the hashtag <a href=\"https://front-end.social/tags/unplugtrump\">#unplugtrump</a>.

    "title": "Maybe don't use custom properties in shorthand properties",
    "partialText": "<p>I've already written about how the fact that the initial value of a custom property is a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#guaranteed-invalid\">guaranteed-invalid value</a> can lead to unexpected results. Today, I realized how that can be problematic when you use custom properties in shorthand properties.</p><h2>A quick recap</h2>\n<p>When you set a valid value for a property followed by another declaration with an invalid value, the second declaration will be ignored. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  background-color: #F00;\n  background-color: fcktrmp;\n}\n\n/* Result: #F00 background */</code></pre>\n<p>That's one of the reasons why CSS is so great. It's forgiving.</p>\n<p>When the value in the second declaration is a custom property that doesn't exist, the declaration is not ignored. Either the property’s inherited value or its initial value, depending on whether the property is inherited or not, will be used instead.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  background-color: #F00;\n  background-color: var(--not-set);\n}\n\n/* Result: transparent background */</code></pre>\n<p>You can learn more about that in <a href=\"/blog/2022/100daysof-day1\">Day 1: custom properties and fallbacks</a> and <a href=\"/blog/2023/invalid-custom-properties\">Invalid at computed-value time</a>. </p>\n<h2>Invalid custom properties in short hand properties</h2>\n<p>Okay, now that we know that undeclared custom properties are invalid, let's see what happens when we use them in shorthand properties.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-width: 20px var(--border--inline) 10px;\n}</code></pre>\n<style>\n.demo {\n  width: 5rem;\n  height: 5rem;\n  border-style: solid;\n}\n.one {\n  border-width: 20px var(--border--inline) 10px;\n}\n.two {\n    border-block-start-width: 20px;\n    border-inline-width: var(--border--inline);\n    border-block-end-width: 10px;\n}\n.three {\n  --border--inline: 30px;\n}\n.four {\n    border-style: solid;\n  border-block-start-width: 20px;\n  border-inline-width: var(--border-inline, 30px);\n  border-block-end-width: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\">\n  <div class=\"demo one\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>The <code>--border-inline</code> custom property doesn't exist, which means it's invalid. That's enough to invalidate the entire declaration.</p>\n<p>We get a different result if we don't use the shorthand property because the missing custom property only invalidates one property.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-block-start-width: 20px;\n  border-inline-width: var(--border--inline);\n  border-block-end-width: 10px;\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\">\n  <div class=\"demo two\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>For the sake of completeness, here's how it looks like when the property exists.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  --border-inline: 30px;\n\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-block-start-width: 20px;\n  border-inline-width: var(--border-inline);\n  border-block-end-width: 10px;\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\">\n  <div class=\"demo one three\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>Of course, you're also save if you provide a fallback for your custom property.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">div {\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-block-start-width: 20px;\n  border-inline-width: var(--border-inline, 30px);\n  border-block-end-width: 10px;\n}</code></pre>\n<div data-sample=\"demo\">\n  <div class=\"demo four\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>That an invalid custom property invalidates the entire declaration isn't surprising, but I didn't consider it until I saw one of my declarations break. I guess it's just good to know that, especially if you're working a lot with custom properties. So, maybe don't use custom properties in shorthand properties or use custom properties but don't use shorthand properties.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CMaybe+don%27t+use+custom+properties+in+shorthand+properties%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

When Musk started firing more people, changing the terms of services, and doing other despicable things, I didn't wish to be back anymore, but I still wanted my account back.

What I care about is that I can finally close this chapter.

    "title": "What's an interactive element?",
    "partialText": "<p>Two years ago, I wrote an <a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/focus-dialog/\">article about the dialog element</a>. I tested where focus goes when you open a modal dialog via the <code>showModal()</code> method. I tried different combinations of elements and attributes to see what happens because back in 2023, the behaviour was very inconsistent.</p><p>In one of my tests, I put the tabindex attribute on the dialog element. That's why Joy contacted me earlier this week, because she was unsure whether this was a good idea since the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/dialog#usage_notes\">page on MDN about the dialog element</a> says the following:</p>\n<img alt=\"Warning: The tabindex attribute must not be used on the dialog element. See usage notes.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2025/whats-an-interactive-element/944ece94da-1761306999/warning.png\">\n<p>And here's the usage note:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not add the tabindex property to the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element as it is not interactive and does not receive focus. The dialog's contents, including the close button contained in the dialog, can receive focus and be interactive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I recommended to ignore this warning and I also promised to give a proper, more detailed answer in a blog post.</p>\n<h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>Before I share my opinions with you, let me clarify that this post is not about MDN. MDN is one of the few websites I visit every day, and I'm a big fan. I also understand that the content is open source and a community effort. One will likely disagree with some opinions at some point.</p>\n<h2>Using tabindex on the dialog element</h2>\n<p>I couldn't stop thinking about this warning the entire week because I don't understand why the authors put so much emphasis on it. There is this big fat red warning early on the page saying that you must not use the tabindex attribute on the dialog element.</p>\n<p>I know where this is coming from. In the <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#the-dialog-element\">HTML spec for the dialog element</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tabindex attribute must not be specified on dialog elements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, technically, they’re right because the spec says that you must not use the tabindex attribute on the dialog element. I don’t understand why, though, or at least I don’t understand the phrasing, because it’s absolutely fine to use the tabindex attribute on the dialog element. It doesn’t break anything. The only reason I can think of not to use it is that it’s not necessary. The <a href=\"blog/2023/focus-dialog/\">dialog element itself already handles focus well</a>. I don’t know if I’m missing anything, but I would rephrase that to something like “It’s <em>not necessary</em> to put the tabindex attribute on the dialog element”.</p>\n<p>I'm annoyed by the prominent styling of this warning, but what's really bugging me is what they have to say in the usage note.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not add the tabindex property to the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element as it is not interactive and does not receive focus. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both statements are wrong. The dialog element does receive focus because it's an interactive element. Try it yourself.</p>\n<p><button class=\"show\">Open dialog</button></p>\n<p class=\"output\">\n  Last focused element: <output>BODY</output>\n</p>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>HTML:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;dialog&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Demo 1&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;/dialog&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>JS:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">button.addEventListener('click', e =&gt; {\n    dialog.showModal(); \n    output.textContent = document.activeElement.tagName\n});</code></pre>\n<dialog closedby=\"any\">\n  <h1>Demo 1</h2>\n  <p>Close by pressing Esc or clicking outside</p>\n</dialog>\n<script>\ndocument.querySelector('.show').addEventListener('click', e => { document.querySelector('dialog').showModal(); document.querySelector('output').textContent = document.activeElement.tagName});\n</script>\n<p>Although it sounds like I'm writing this blog post because I find these statements so horrible, I'm not. I'm writing it because I feel like there's a general misunderstanding of what an interactive element is and what focusable really means. I wasn't 100% sure either, so I did some research.</p>\n<h2>Interactive elements</h2>\n<p>The first sentence in <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus\">the section about focus in the HTML spec</a> is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An HTML user interface typically consists of multiple interactive widgets, such as form controls, scrollable regions, links, dialog boxes, browser tabs, and so forth. These widgets form a hierarchy, with some (e.g. browser tabs, dialog boxes) containing others (e.g. links, form controls).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The dialog is an interactive element that can contain other interactive elements. I could stop here because I already have the information I need, but let's keep going. Interactive elements can be focused, which makes them <strong>focusable areas</strong>.</p>\n<p>Focusable areas are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Elements that meet all the following criteria:</strong> (see <a href=\"#examples-areas\">examples below</a>)<ol>\n<li>The element's tabindex value is non-null, or the user agent determines the element to be focusable</li>\n<li>The element is either not a shadow host, or has a shadow root whose delegates focus is false;</li>\n<li>The element is not <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#concept-element-disabled\">actually disabled</a>;</li>\n<li>The element is not inert.</li>\n<li>The element is either being rendered, delegating its rendering to its children, or being used as relevant canvas fallback content.  </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The shapes of area elements in an image map</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The user-agent provided subwidgets of elements</strong><br />\nFor example, the controls in the user interface for a video element, the up and down buttons in a spin-control version of <code>&lt;input type=number&gt;</code>.<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;video controls&gt;\n&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Scrollable regions of elements</strong><br />\nA div can be an interactive element, too. You probably want your scrollable element to be a labelled semantic element, though.<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div style=\"inline-size: 10rem; overflow: auto;\"&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"inline-size: 20rem\"&gt;\n I'm overflowing\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The viewport of a document that has a non-null browsing context and is not inert.</strong><br />\nFor example, the contents of an iframe. Note: Key events routed to an iframe get immediately routed to its active document. </li>\n<li><strong>Any other element or part of an element determined by the user agent to be a focusable area, especially to aid with accessibility or to better match platform conventions. </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"examples-areas\">Examples</h3>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>The element's tabindex value is non-null:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;section tabindex=\"-1\" aria-label=\"Results\"&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>The user agent determines the element to be focusable:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;dialog&gt;&lt;/dialog&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>The element has a shadow root whose delegates focus is false</strong></p>\n<p>A normally focusable element with a shadow root won't receive focus if it delegates it. In the following example you can't focus <code>the-button</code> even though it has tabindex set to 0 because it delegates focus to the nested <code>button</code>.</p>\n<p>\n<the-button tabindex=\"0\">\n  This is my button\n</the-button>\n</p>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;the-button tabindex=\"0\"&gt;\n  This is my button\n&lt;/the-button&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>CSS</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">the-button {\n  border: 4px solid; \n  padding: 1rem;\n}</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>JS</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">class TheButton extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.attachShadow({ \n      mode: \"open\", \n      delegatesFocus: true\n    });\n\n    const button = document.createElement(\"button\");\n    button.textContent = \"Focus me\";\n\n    this.shadowRoot.append(button);\n  }\n}\n\ncustomElements.define(\"the-button\", TheButton);</code></pre>\n<style>\nthe-button {border: 4px solid; padding: 1rem;}\n</style>\n<script>\nclass TheButton extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.attachShadow({ mode: \"open\", delegatesFocus: true  });\n    const button = document.createElement(\"button\");\n    button.textContent = \"Focus me\";\n    this.shadowRoot.append(button);\n  }\n}\ncustomElements.define(\"the-button\", TheButton);\n</script>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>The element is not actually disabled</strong></p>\n<p class=\"code-label\" style=\"font-weight: normal\">That means that the <code>disabled</code> attribute is not present on the element.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button disabled&gt;This button is actually disabled&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>The element is not inert</strong></p>\n<p class=\"code-label\" style=\"font-weight: normal\">That means that the <code>inert</code> attribute is not present on the element.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button inert&gt;This button is inert&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>The element is being rendered</strong></p>\n<p class=\"code-label\" style=\"font-weight: normal\">That means that the element has any associated CSS layout boxes</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button hidden&gt;This button is not being rendered&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button style=\"display: none\"&gt;This button is not being rendered&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>The element is delegating its rendering to its children</strong></p>\n<p class=\"code-label\" style=\"font-weight: normal\">That means that the element is not being rendered but its children could be rendered.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div style=\"display: contents\"&gt;\nThis div is not being rendered, but…\n&lt;button&gt;…this button is being rendered&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<h2>Focusable elements</h2>\n<p>Most of the things I wrote in the previous chapter probably weren't new to you. You already know that interactive elements are focusable, but what does <em>focusable</em> mean?</p>\n<p>An element is focusable when it can be focused programmatically, e.g. via the <code>focus()</code> method or the <code>autofocus</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>Focusable elements can either be <strong>sequentially focusable</strong>, <strong>click focusable</strong>, both, or none of them. These two terms determine how the user agent responds to user interaction.</p>\n<h3>Sequentially focusable</h3>\n<p>Users can reach sequentially focusable elements by pressing the Tab key.</p>\n<p>With respect to platform conventions, the <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-tabindex-attribute\">specification suggests</a> that the following elements should be sequentially focusable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> that have an href attribute</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></li>\n<li><code>&lt;input&gt;</code> with the exception of <code>&lt;input type=\"hidden\"&gt;</code></li>\n<li><code>&lt;select&gt;</code> </li>\n<li><code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> </li>\n<li><code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> that are the first summary element child of a details element</li>\n<li>Editing hosts (A <code>[contenteditable]</code> element or a child HTML element of a Document whose <a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/OPMZxOq\">design mode enabled</a> is true).</li>\n<li>Navigable containers (e.g. <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>)</li>\n<li>Elements with a <code>[tabindex]</code> 0 or higher.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead of referring to these elements as sequentially focusable, you can also say <strong>tabbable</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Click focusable</h3>\n<p>Users can reach click-focusable elements by clicking them.</p>\n<style>\n.grid * {\n  all: unset;\n  border: 2px solid;\n  aspect-ratio: 1;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n  margin: 0 !important;\n}\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(10rem, 1fr));\n}\n.grid :focus {\n  background: aqua;\n}\n</style>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>HTML:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button&gt;button&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;dialog open&gt;dialog&lt;/dialog&gt;\n&lt;div tabindex=\"-1\"&gt;tabindex=-1&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>CSS:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:focus {\n  background: aqua;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>\n  Click/tab on one of the following elements to focus it.\n</p>\n<div class=\"grid\">\n  <button>button</button>\n  <dialog open>dialog</dialog>\n  <div tabindex=\"-1\">tabindex=-1</div>\n</div>\n<p>The button is sequentially and click focusable.<br />\nThe open dialog is only click focusable in Firefox (144) but also sequentially focusable in Chrome 141 and Safari 18.6 (Interesting!)<br />\nThe div with the negative tabindex is only click focusable.</p>\n<p>That means that an element can be focusable without being sequentially focusable/tabbable.</p>\n<h3>Neither sequentially focusable nor click focusable.</h3>\n<p>To make it even more complex, an element can still be programmatically focusable without being sequentially focusable or click focusable.</p>\n<p>You can't focus this input field by using Tab or clicking on it, but you can by clicking on the label or the focus button.</p>\n<p>\n  <label for=\"r\">Read only</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"r\" tabindex=\"-1\" readonly>\n</p>\n<p>\n<button class=\"focus\">Focus</button>\n</p>\n<script>\ndocument.querySelector('.focus').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  document.querySelector('#r').focus();\n})\n</script>\n<style>\n#r {\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n[for=\"r\"] { font-weight:bold; display: block;}\n</style>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>HTML:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;label for=\"r\"&gt;Read only&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"r\" tabindex=\"-1\" readonly&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>CSS:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">input {\n  pointer-events: none;\n}</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\"><strong>JS:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {\n  document.querySelector('input').focus();\n})</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Read-only input elements are tabbable by default, I only added the tabindex attribute for the purpose of this demo.</p>\n<h2>Making non-interactive elements interactive</h2>\n<p>There is one more unanswered question: Is it okay to make non-interactive elements interactive?</p>\n<p>Here's what MDN has to say about it on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/tabindex#accessibility_concerns\">the page about the tabindex attribute</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Avoid using the tabindex attribute in conjunction with non-interactive content to make something intended to be interactive focusable by keyboard input. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Considering their wrong definition of the term interactive element, this sentence doesn't make sense because it means that you're only supposed to put the tabindex attribute on sequentially focusable elements. We're not supposed to use -1 or a number greater than 0, so we're left with 0, which does not affect an already focusable element.</p>\n<p>It is perfectly acceptable to place <code>tabindex=-1</code> on a non-interactive element when it helps with accessibility. In a client-side rendered application, I may want to move users to a specific location within the page. For example, in a search widget, I could place the focus on the container that contains all search results after the user has clicked the search button.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;section tabindex=\"-1\" aria-labelledbyy=\"heading\"&gt;\n  &lt;h2 id=\"heading\"&gt;42 search results&lt;/h2&gt;\n  …\n&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The next paragraph starts with this sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interactive components authored using non-interactive elements are not listed in the accessibility tree. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sentence isn't correct, but I know what they're trying to say: Don't set tabindex on generic elements. I agree with that. If you use tabindex, use it on a labelled semantic element like I did in the previous example. Here's another example.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;h2 tabindex=\"-1\"&gt;42 search results&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Doing something like that is fine, because it makes the element programmatically focusable but not sequentially focusable. In most cases, you shouldn't turn non-interactive elements into sequentially focusable elements. In other words: Don't make a div or h2 tabbable, use a button instead.</p>\n<h2>tl;dr</h2>\n<p>Okay, wow, that escalated a bit. </p>\n<p>Long story short: Interactive elements are focusable, but focusable doesn't necessarily mean tabbable because there are also click focusable elements, which aren't tabbable but can be focused programmatically or via click.<br />\nAlso, it's perfectly acceptable to place tabindex on a non-interactive element when it helps with accessibility.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CWhat%27s+an+interactive+element%3F%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Dealbreaker bugs in native popovers",
    "partialText": "<p>One of my clients decided to write a custom popover component that uses native popovers under the hood. We built the component and were happy with it. They were about to ship it until we realised there was an accessibility bug so severe that it was a dealbreaker for us.</p><p>Popovers are floating UI elements you can show or hide by pressing a button. They come with many accessibility features built in, so you don’t have to handle most of the work. You can learn more about that in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RVxl5nZY790?si=eOHjsaMnAqtMnG3n\">“The accessibility of the popover attribute” (YouTube)</a>.</p>\n<p>All you need to use popovers is the <code>popover</code> and <code>popovertarget</code> attributes.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;button popovertarget=\"popover-html\"&gt;HTML&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;div popover id=\"popover-html\"&gt;\n  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. \n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p class=\"code-label\">\n  Try it yourself:\n</p>\n<p>\n  <button popovertarget=\"popover-html\">HTML</button>\n</p>\n<div popover id=\"popover-html\">\n  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. \n</div>\n<h2>Bugs</h2>\n<p>Popovers can contain focusable elements, such as buttons. In the following example, if you use the keyboard and focus the first button, press Enter, and press Tab again, you can see how focus jumps from the trigger to the first button inside the popover. By pressing tab repeatedly, you can move from button to button until you finally reach the next button outside the popover.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;p&gt;\n  &lt;button popovertarget=\"popover-buttons\"&gt;First Button&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Second Button&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div popover id=\"popover-buttons\"&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Focusable&lt;/button&gt;  \n  &lt;button&gt;Focusable&lt;/button&gt;  \n  &lt;button&gt;Focusable&lt;/button&gt;  \n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n  <button popovertarget=\"popover-buttons\">First Button</button>\n  <button popovertarget=\"popover-buttons\">Second Button</button>\n</p>\n<div popover id=\"popover-buttons\">\n  <button>Focusable</button>  \n  <button>Focusable</button>  \n  <button>Focusable</button>  \n</div>\n<p>That works as long as you don’t use slots or the details element inside your popovers. If you do, focus will still move from the trigger to the first button inside the popover, but if you press Enter, focus doesn’t jump to the next focusable element inside the popover; it skips all remaining elements, leaves the popover, and then jumps to the next button outside the popover. This bug is present in Chromium-based browsers and versions of Firefox lower than 145.</p>\n<p class=\"code-label\">\n  Details/Summary:\n</p>\n<p>\n  <button popovertarget=\"popover-details\">First Button</button>\n  <button popovertarget=\"popover-details\">Second Button</button>\n</p>\n<div popover id=\"popover-details\">\n  <details><summary>Focusable</summary></details>  \n  <details><summary>Not Focusable</summary></details>  \n  <details><summary>Not Focusable</summary></details>  \n</div>\n<p class=\"code-label\">\n  Web component:\n</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;p&gt;\n  &lt;button popovertarget=\"popover-buttons2\"&gt;First Button&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button popovertarget=\"popover-buttons2\"&gt;Second Button&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div popover id=\"popover-buttons2\"&gt;\n  &lt;the-buttons&gt;\n    &lt;template shadowrootmode=\"open\"&gt;\n      &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;\n        &lt;button&gt;Focusable&lt;/button&gt;  \n        &lt;button&gt;Not Focusable&lt;/button&gt;  \n        &lt;button&gt;Not Focusable&lt;/button&gt;  \n    &lt;/template&gt;\n  &lt;/the-buttons&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>\n  <button popovertarget=\"popover-buttons2\">First Button</button>\n  <button popovertarget=\"popover-buttons2\">Second Button</button>\n</p>\n<div popover id=\"popover-buttons2\">\n  <the-buttons>\n    <template shadowrootmode=\"open\">\n      <slot></slot>\n        <button>Focusable</button>  \n        <button>Not Focusable</button>  \n        <button>Not Focusable</button>  \n    </template>\n  </the-buttons>\n</div>\n<p>Unfortunately, that was a dealbreaker for us. By providing components for others to use, we have no control over how they’ll use them. Since we built our pattern library with web components, some of which use Shadow DOM and slots, people will likely also use them in popovers, making them inaccessible to many.</p>\n<p>Popovers are great, and they work well, except for these two bugs. You should definitely use them if you have control over the content inside them. If you don’t, you should consider waiting until these bugs have been resolved.</p>\n<h2>Related Bugs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/402282793?pli=1\">Set focus by tabbing to slotted content inside a custom element with popover api does not work [402282793] - Chromium</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/424764874\">Tab navigation unexpected behavior for summary/details inside popover [424764874] - Chromium</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1972609#c11\">1972609 - Tab navigation unexpected behavior for summary/details inside popover</a></li>\n</ul><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CDealbreaker+bugs+in+native+popovers%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>I recently added a rule to my <a href=\"https://fokus.dev/tools/uaplus/\">reset style sheet UA+</a> that I wanted to share with you.</p><p>When you add a popover to a page and open it, it looks similar to a dialog in terms of its styling. It's positioned at the center of the viewport.</p>\n<p><button popovertarget=\"popover-html\">HTML</button></p>\n<div id=\"popover-html\" popover class=\"prevent\">\n  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard <a href=\"#\">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. \n</div>\n<p>That's okay, but I would argue that in most cases you want your popovers aligned closely with the button that controls them. As it turns out, that's super easy to achieve in browsers that support <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Anchor_positioning\">CSS anchor positioning</a>, since popovers already have an implicit anchor. All you need to do is overwrite the margin property and position the popover. I'm wrapping the rule in a feature query to ensure the margin isn't reset in browsers that don't support CSS anchor positioning (At the time of writing, most importantly Safari).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">  @supports(position-area: end) {\n    [popover] {\n      margin: 0;\n      position-area: end span-end;\n      position-try-fallbacks: flip-block, flip-inline, flip-block flip-inline;\n    }\n  }</code></pre>\n<p>If you're in Chrome or Firefox, you should see the popover aligned and the bottom left (or right for RTL) edge of the button. </p>\n<p><button popovertarget=\"popover-html2\">HTML</button></p>\n<div id=\"popover-html2\" popover>\n  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard <a href=\"#\">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.\n</div>\n<p>You can also add <code>position-try-fallbacks: flip-block, flip-inline, flip-block flip-inline;</code>, as I did here, to tell the popover to try flipping its position along the inline and block axis if it overflows the viewport in its initial position (Thanks, Temani, for the hint).</p>\n<p>Nice and easy, and it's a much better default.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CBetter+defaults+for+popovers%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "My favourite front-end and web development conferences",
    "partialText": "<p>As someone who enjoys attending conferences, I thought it might be helpful to share a list of my favourite front-end and web development conferences.</p><h2>Smashing Conf 🇩🇪🇳🇱🇧🇪</h2>\n<p>I've been attending Smashing Conf for more than 10 years now. It's obviously one of my favourite events. It's a relatively small conference, the topics focus on web development and design, the atmosphere is fantastic, and you can learn a lot.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/freiburg-2026\">Smashing Conf</a> to learn new web development and design techniques.</p>\n<h2>Beyond Tellerrand 🇩🇪</h2>\n<p>Beyond Tellerrand is a one-of-a-kind event. It's not necessarily a web conference, but there are always several talks about web development. I would say the core topic of the event is design and creativity.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://beyondtellerrand.com/\">Beyond Tellerrand</a> to meet like-minded people and get inspired.</p>\n<h2>Fronteers Dark Mode 🇳🇱</h2>\n<p>I've never attended Fronteers Dark mode, but I did attend the original Fronteers conference, which I liked a lot. In terms of the topics and the atmosphere, it's very similar to Smashing Conf. Dark Mode is a spinoff from the original event and sounds super interesting. I definitely plan to attend it.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://www.fronteers.nl/en/conference/\">Fronteers Dark Mode</a> to learn new web development and design techniques.</p>\n<h2>CSS Day 🇳🇱</h2>\n<p>If you're into CSS, you would love CSS Day. It's two days focused on CSS with skilled and talented speakers from all around the world. What's great about CSS Day is the conversations you will have in between and after the talks, because there are so many smart and friendly people there who love CSS.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://cssday.nl/\">CSS Day</a> if you want to learn a lot about CSS. I will be there this year.</p>\n<h2>State of the Browser 🇬🇧</h2>\n<p>State of the Browser is a nice little community-driven web development conference, which I immediately fell in love with. High-quality talks, nice people, great atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/\">State of the Browser</a> to learn new web development techniques.  I will be there this year.</p>\n<h2>A-Tag 🇦🇹</h2>\n<p>A-Tag is where the Austrian web accessibility community meets every year. It's the perfect event to stay up to date on accessibility-related topics and network.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://atag.accessible-media.at/\">A-Tag</a> to learn about accessibility.</p>\n<h2>a11yTO 🇨🇦</h2>\n<p>I only attended a11yTO once, but I was blown away by the quality of this event.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://a11yto.com/\">a11yTO</a> to learn about accessibility.</p>\n<h2>ParisWeb 🇫🇷</h2>\n<p>ParisWeb is another community-driven event I was impressed by, even though most talks were in French and there were only four English-speaking speakers. Still, I could tell it's a great event.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://www.paris-web.fr/\">ParisWeb</a> to learn new web development techniques and accessibility best practices.</p>\n<h2>Potential Candidates</h2>\n<p>I have three more events I plan to attend, and I have a feeling they're going to be great.</p>\n<h3>Web Day Out 🇬🇧</h3>\n<p>Web Day Out is a new conference held in Brighton. The core idea of the event is to get you up to speed on the most powerful web platform features that you can use right now. I love that because it aligns perfectly with what I've been working on over the last couple of years: finding ways to break old habits to get the most out of CSS.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://webdayout.com/\">Web Day out</a> to learn what you can do in web browsers today.  I will be there this year. You can use <a href=\"https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out/discount/JOIN_MANUEL\">the discount code JOIN_MANUEL</a> to save 10% off the original price.</p>\n<h2>WebExpo 🇨🇿</h2>\n<p>WebExpo is a larger event, but from what I've heard, it still feels community-driven. I don't know how great it is, but I've only heard good opinions.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://webexpo.net/\">WebExpo</a> to learn new web development techniques.  I may be there this year.</p>\n<h2>FrontKon 🇨🇿</h2>\n<p>FrontKon is another event I haven't attended yet, but I heard it's great. This year, they also have more English-speaking speakers.</p>\n<p>Attend <a href=\"https://www.frontkon.dev/\">FrontKon</a> to learn new web development techniques.  I will be there this year.</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CMy+favourite+front-end+and+web+development+conferences%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Lowering the specificity of multiple rules at once",
    "partialText": "<p>You probably already knew that you can use <code>:where()</code> to lower the specificity of a single selector, but did you know that you can achieve a similar effect on multiple rules at once?</p><p>The other day, I had an Aha! moment when someone suggested something I knew existed but hadn't considered using. In my <a href=\"https://fokus.dev/tools/uaplus/\">reset style sheet UA+</a>, I used <code>:where()</code> for combined selectors to keep specificity low. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:where(abbr[title]) {\n  cursor: help;\n  text-decoration-line: underline;\n  text-decoration-style: dotted;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Someone suggested using it everywhere for consistency and to achieve the lowest possible specificity for all rules. I liked the idea and wrapped all selectors in <code>:where()</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:where(h1) {\n  font-size: 2em;\n  margin-block: 0.67em;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>This change improved usability but reduced readability.<br />\nIt was like that for a while until <a href=\"https://github.com/fokus-dev/uaplus/issues/14\">Emilio asked</a> why I didn't wrap everything in an anonymous <code>@layer</code> instead. When I read his question, I needed some time to process because the solution felt so obvious, yet I was surprised I hadn't thought of it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@layer {\n  abbr[title] {\n    cursor: help;\n    text-decoration-line: underline;\n    text-decoration-style: dotted;\n  }\n\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 2em;\n    margin-block: 0.67em;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Here are the things that went through my head when I saw Emilio's post:</p>\n<h2>Using an anonymous layer without any other cascade layers</h2>\n<p>Let's say you don't have any cascade layers in your CSS. By adding a third-party file containing all rules nested in a layer, all your rules will override the rules within that layer, since unlayered rules have precedence over layered ones.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* uaplus.css */\n@layer {\n  h1 {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n\n/* your.css */\nh1 {\n  color: blue;\n}\n\n/* Result: blue */</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, that's only the case as long as I'm not using <code>!important</code> in UA+.</p>\n<p>What's cool about this is that it doesn't even matter where or how you include the reset stylesheet. Normal unlayered rules always override normal layered rules.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">\n/* your.css */\nh1 {\n  color: blue;\n}\n\n/* uaplus.css */\n@layer {\n  h1 {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Result: blue */</code></pre>\n<h2>Using an anonymous with other cascade layers</h2>\n<p>If you are already using cascade layers, there are two things we need to take care of: order and naming. </p>\n<h3>Order</h3>\n<p>For this to work, the anonymous layer must be the first layer in the CSS, since layers defined later in the document override those defined earlier.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* uaplus.css */\n@layer {\n  h1 {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n\n/* your.css */\n@layer base {\n  h1 {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Result: blue */</code></pre>\n<p>Since a reset style sheet is something that you put at the very beginning of your CSS anyway, that shouldn't be a problem.</p>\n<h3>Naming</h3>\n<p>My layer is anonymous to avoid clashes with your layers. That's important because I can't ensure you're not using a name like “reset”, for example. Using a named layer could potentially mess with the order of your layers.</p>\n<p>In the following example, my reset stylesheet would change the order of layers from <code>first, reset, base, components</code>  to <code>reset, first, base, components</code>, if I named it <em>reset</em>. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">/* fictional-uaplus.css */\n@layer reset {\n  h1 {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n}\n\n/* your.css */\n@layer first, reset, base, components; </code></pre>\n<h2>Beyond reset stylesheets</h2>\n<p>Writing this post, I realised that this technique is not just limited to resetting stylesheets. If you have a specificity issue within a layer, you can wrap rules in an (anonymous) layer to regain control.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@layer components {\n  h1 {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n\n  @layer {\n    h1 {\n      color: red;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n/* Result: blue */</code></pre>\n<p>I really like this solution, and I hope you had a similar Aha! moment reading my post as I did reading Emilio's comment (Thanks again). :)</p><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CLowering+the+specificity+of+multiple+rules+at+once%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",

    "title": "Introduction to the new HTML element <geolocation>",
    "partialText": "<p>There is a new HTML element called <strong>geolocation</strong>. I checked it out and here's what I learned.</p><h2>The <code>&lt;geolocation&gt;</code> element</h2>\n<p>The <code>&lt;geolocation&gt;</code> element provides a button that, when activated, prompts the user for permission to access their location. Originally, it was designed as a general <code>&lt;permission&gt;</code> element, but browser vendors indicated that implementing a “one-size-fits-all” element would be too complex. The result was a single-purpose element, probably the first of several. </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;geolocation&gt;\n  &lt;strong&gt;Your browser doesn't support &amp;lt;geolocation&amp;gt;. Try Chrome 144+&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;/geolocation&gt;</code></pre>\n<style>\ndl { margin-top: 1rem; display: grid; grid-template-columns: min-content 1fr; }\ndd { margin: 0; }\ndl div { grid-column: 1 / -1; display: inherit; grid-template-columns: subgrid; gap: 1rem;}\n:granted { border: 4px solid green; }\n</style>\n<script>\nconst updateMap = e => {\n  let coords;\n  if (!('HTMLGeolocationElement' in window)) {\n    coords = e.coords;\n  } else {\n    coords = e.target.position.coords\n  }\n  const result = `<dl>\n    <div>\n    <dt>Accuracy</dt>\n    <dd>${coords.accuracy}</dd>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n    <dt>Latitude</dt>\n    <dd>${coords.latitude}</dd>\n    </div>\n    <div>    \n    <dt>Longitude</dt>\n    <dd>${coords.longitude}</dd>\n    </div>\n  </dl>`\n  e.target.nextElementSibling.innerHTML = result; \n}\n</script>\n<div>\n<geolocation id=\"geo1\">\n  <strong>Your browser doesn't support &lt;geolocation&gt;. Try Chrome 144+</strong>\n</geolocation>\n<div role=\"status\"></div>\n</div>\n<script>\nconst geo = document.querySelector('#geo1');\ngeo.addEventListener('location', updateMap)\n</script>\n<p>When a user clicks the button, three things can happen:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If they haven't granted permission yet, the browser will ask them for permission.<img alt=\"&quot;prompt in chrome: cdpn.io wants to know your location. two options: allow while visiting the site and allow this time.&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2026/geolocation-element/aa98dffcaa-1770274523/prompt1.webp\">\n</li>\n<li>If they have previously denied permission, they can undo it or keep denying. <img alt=\"&quot;prompt in chrome: you probably didn&#039;t allow location for this site. two options: continue not allowing and allow this time.&quot;\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2026/geolocation-element/8cf1ec25d6-1770274524/prompt2.webp\">\n</li>\n<li>If they have granted permission already, clicking the button again will get the current location without re-prompting. It acts like a refresh button.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Attributes</h2>\n<p>Retrieving the user's location is the core functionality of the element, but you can adjust what and how you get it.</p>\n<h3><code>accuracymode</code></h3>\n<p>Using the <code>accuracymode</code> attribute, you can enable high accuracy to get the most accurate position. The result may be more precise, but it can also result in slower response times and increased power consumption. Another factor is privacy; if you don't need the user's exact position, it's probably best to leave it at the default (<code>approximate</code>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;geolocation accuracymode=\"precise\"&gt;\n  Your browser doesn't support &amp;lt;geolocation&amp;gt;.\n&lt;/geolocation&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>When you set <code>accuracymode</code> to <code>precise</code>, the icon and button text change from a pin and “Use location” to a crosshair and “Use precise location”.</p>\n<div>\n<geolocation id=\"geo2\" accuracymode=\"precise\">\n  <strong>Your browser doesn't support &lt;geolocation&gt;. Try Chrome 144+</strong>\n</geolocation>\n<div role=\"status\"></div>\n</div>\n<script>\nconst geo2 = document.querySelector('#geo2');\ngeo2.addEventListener('location', updateMap)\n</script>\n<div class=\"highlight\">\n  <strong>Note: </strong>You may notice that <code>accuracymode=\"precise\"</code> gives you the same or even a worse result than the default setting. To see a difference, try the demo on a smartphone and outside of a building.\n</div>\n<h3><code>autolocate</code></h3>\n<p>If you set the <code>autolocate</code> attribute and the user has previously granted permission to use their location, the element will attempt to retrieve the location when it loads. That means the onlocation event will fire on page load, even if the user doesn't press the button.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;geolocation autolocate&gt;\n    &lt;strong&gt;Your browser doesn't support &amp;lt;geolocation&amp;gt;. Try Chrome 144+&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;/geolocation&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/azZGOyd\">autolocate Demo</a></p>\n<h3><code>watch</code></h3>\n<p>If you set the <code>watch</code> attribute, the element fires events continuously as the user moves. I tested this by moving from one room to another in my office, and it worked really well.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;geolocation watch&gt;\n    &lt;strong&gt;Your browser doesn't support &amp;lt;geolocation&amp;gt;. Try Chrome 144+&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;/geolocation&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/PwzaxZa\">watch Demo</a></p>\n<h2>JavaScript</h2>\n<p>To retrieve and process the user's location, you can listen for the <code>onlocation</code> event and access the read-only <code>position</code> property, which returns the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GeolocationPosition\">GeolocationPosition</a> object once available.<br />\nIt contains the <code>coords</code> property and a timestamp. The most relevant information inside the <code>coords</code> property is the latitude, longitude, and the accuracy, which denotes the position accuracy radius in meters.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const geo = document.querySelector('geolocation');\ngeo.addEventListener('location', e =&gt; {\n  console.log(e.target.position)\n})</code></pre>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<p>The geolocation element is focusable by default, and it has an implicit button role. I tested it using a keyboard and VoiceOver on macOS. Focus management worked fine in my limited test. There isn't much to say about the element's accessibility, since it's basically a button.</p>\n<p>There's one interesting factor, though: styling constraints.</p>\n<h2>Styling</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of interesting points to note about gelocations styling.</p>\n<h3>A new pseudo-class</h3>\n<p>You can use the new <code>:granted</code> pseudo-class to style the button differently when permission has been granted.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:granted {\n  border: 4px solid green;\n}</code></pre>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>While geolocation looks like a button, you can't style it like a button. There are certain styling constraints to ensure user trust and prevent deceptive design patterns.

    "partialText": "<p>When you open the accessibility settings on your smartphone and increase the font size, you will immediately notice that the system font size increases. On Android, as a Firefox user, you will also notice that websites scale. As a Chrome user, you won't see any difference because Chrome doesn't respect the font size settings for web content. As an iOS user, it's the same.</p><figure>\n<img alt=\"Three screenshots of my website. Text size increased on the OS.

This only applies to text that uses relative units. In the screenshots below, you can see that the text size defined in pixels stays the same, while the text size defined in rem and em scales relative to the system font size.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">\n&lt;div style=\"font-size: 16px;\"&gt;My pixel test&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=\"font-size: 1em;\"&gt;My em test&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"&gt;My rem test&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Text size increased on the OS. Chrome does nothing, Chrome Canary scales the text defined in em and rem. Firefox scales the entire page.\" height=\"511\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.matuzo.at/media/pages/blog/2026/text-scaling-meta-tag/89cfefe8ef-1770362893/comparison2.webp\" width=\"912\">\n<figcaption>\n<p>A comparison of Chrome, which doesn't support the meta tag yet, Chrome Canary, and Firefox.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>You may notice that Firefox also scales the text defined in px. That's because Firefox doesn't just scale the text; it performs a full-page zoom, which is something completely different. To prove that I added a border to the body that changes color at different breakpoints.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">body {\n  border-top: 20px solid var(--color, black);\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 200px) {\n  body { --color: aqua; }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 300px) {\n  body { --color: fuchsia; }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 400px) {\n  body { --color: salmon; } \n}</code></pre>\n<p>In Firefox, the border is aqua. Because of full-page scaling, it doesn't even reach the 300px breakpoint.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/dPXqPVj\">Try it yourself</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I understand why they made this an option rather than changing how browsers behaved by default, because it would break too many websites. That being said, if you want to use it, first test it properly because adding the meta tag may result in horizontal scrolling, at least that's what happened on my website. I like the fact that we have more control to respect user preferences, and I'm looking forward to the meta tag being supported by more browsers.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Josh and the rest of the team for your efforts!</p>\n<h2>Additional resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-5/#text-scale-meta\">Text-Scale meta element</a></li>\n</ul><p>My blog doesn't support comments yet, but you can reply via <a href=\"mailto:blog@matuzo.at?subject=Comment+on+%E2%80%9CA+new+meta+tag+for+respecting+text+scaling+on+mobile%E2%80%9D\">blog@matuzo.at</a>.</p>",
