    "title": "An in-depth guide to customising lists with CSS",
    "partialText": "<p>This first rule of styling lists is that they should be treated with the same reverence you would show any other text. If a list is inserted within a passage of text, treat it as a continuation and integral part of that text.</p>\n<p>For bulleted or <dfn>unordered</dfn> lists, use padding to indent each list item the equivalent distance of a line height. This will allow the bullet to sit neatly in a square of white-space.</p>\n<pre><code>ul {\n\tpadding-inline-start: 1lh;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Numbered or <dfn>ordered</dfn> lists which reach into double figures and beyond will require more space. Allocate this space in multiples and fractions of the line height.</p>\n<h2>The basics: choosing different kinds of lists</h2>\n<h3>Unordered lists</h3>\n<p>Unordered lists are given filled <strong>discs</strong> for bullets by default. As lists are further nested, browsers apply <strong>circles</strong>. These are followed by filled <strong>squares</strong> for lists nested three or more deep.</p>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/WbxmjZm\">Lists: example 0 - default nested lists</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>You can change which bullets are used through the <code>list-style-type</code> property with values of <code>disc</code>, <code>circle</code> and <code>square</code> respectively. For example, to make all unordered list items filled squares use:</p>\n<pre><code>ul li {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to use a different symbol for a bullet you can do so by specifying it in quote marks. You’re not limited to individual characters – as well as regular glyphs, you can use words and emoji.</p>\n<p>The <code>-type</code> suffix of <code>list-style-type</code> implies that the bullets are typographical. You can also use images for your list bullets. Link to your image using the <code>list-style-image</code> property.</p>\n<p>You can position the bullet in-line with your text by using <code>list-style-position: inside</code>. Use <code>outside</code> to set it back again.</p>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/VYjroYK\">Lists: example 1 - basic list-style-type</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<pre><code>ul li.point {\n\tlist-style-type: \"👉️ \";\n}\n\nul li.tool {\n\tlist-style-image: url(wrench.svg);\n}\n\nul.notes li {\n\tlist-style-type: \"Note: \";\n\tlist-style-position: inside;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Ordered lists</h3>\n<p>The default style for numbered or <dfn>ordered</dfn> lists is a decimal progression, with each number followed by a full stop. You can change the numbering system to alphabetical or Roman numerals by applying the <code>lower-latin</code>, <code>upper-latin</code>, <code>lower-roman</code>, <code>upper-roman</code> or <code>decimal</code> values of <code>list-style-type</code>. You can also select from many non-Latin numbering systems such as Greek, Devanagari, Persian and Katakana – you’ll need to use these even when the document or element has the appropriate language set.</p>\n<h3>Changing font and colour</h3>\n<p>Numbering and bullets will inherit the colour and font of your list text. While this will provide your reader with a consistent experience, you may wish to style them differently to reduce their visual impact, or otherwise distinguish them from the text.</p>\n<p>The bullets and numbering automatically displayed by browsers are known as <dfn>markers</dfn> in CSS. The good news is that these are created as <code>::marker</code> pseudo-elements which means you can style them directly. The bad news is that we are very limited in which styles we can apply. All you can change is the colour (not the background) and the font via any property beginning with <code>font-</code> such as family, weight and size. You can also animate these properties and specify directionality of the text.</p>\n<p>Despite these limitations, being able to style the colour and font of the markers accounts for a common use case that required workarounds and extra markup in the past. For example, applying these styles directly to the markers…</p>\n<pre><code>ol li::marker {\n\tcolor: gray;\n\tfont-family: sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 0.8em;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>…will reduce the visual impact of your numbering by making it grey, sans-serif and slightly smaller.</p>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/ogLoKxL\">Lists: example 2 - styling using ::marker</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>By default, list markers use tabular numerals, meaning the numbers all line up nicely. If you wanted a different effect you would need to add <code>font-variant-numeric: proportional-nums</code> to your marker styling.</p>\n<p>You might also be tempted to make your numeric markers much larger than your list text. This can be a pleasing effect, however simply changing the <code>font-size</code> of your marker to <code>3em</code> probably won’t achieve the result you’re hoping for:</p>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/vEKWoXm\">Lists: example 3 - changing font size using ::marker</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>The gotcha is that browsers align the baseline of markers with that of the first line of the list item text. Therefore a large list item number will always stick up above the list item text. And because we can’t apply any positioning or layout properties directly to the marker there’s not much you can do about it, although there are alternatives which we’ll come to later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Generating your own marker content</h2>\n<p>You can customise the generated content of the marker as it also takes the <code>content</code> property, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>ul li::marker {\n\t/* make all the bullets pointing hand emoji */\n  content: \"👉️ \";\n}\n\nol li::marker {\n\t/* follow each number by a parenthesis instead of a full stop */\n  content: counter(list-item) \") \";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/NPrwQbB\">Lists: example 4 - generated content in ::marker</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>Generating content for markers is supported by Chromium and Firefox, but not by WebKit (Safari), with no support in sight at the time of writing. Safari falls back to regular bullets or numbering which may, or may not, be acceptable to you depending on whether you consider your styling a progressive enhancement rather than crucial to the meaning of your content.</p>\n<p>So what is <code>::marker</code> good for? It’s definitely the way to go if you want to change just the colour or font of your list markers. Anything more and you’ll need a different technique. Before we get on to those we need to talk about symbols and counters.</p>\n<p>So far we have been defining what the bullets in an entire list should look like, that is to say we’re using the same symbols for all list items at the same level of nesting. However it is also possible to define a sequence of symbols for your bullets. There are a couple of ways to do this. The first is with the <code>symbols()</code> function, which you can use as a value of the <code>list-style</code> property.  For example, you could specify the classic sequence of symbols for footnotes:</p>\n<pre><code>ol {\n\tlist-style: symbols(\"*\" \"†\" \"‡\" \"§\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/blog/css-symbols-list.jpg\" alt=\"The symbols, assigned in the above code block, rendered in Firefox\" title=\"At the time of writing, this only works in Firefox. You can still &lt;a href='https://codepen.io/clagnut/pen/dPXZxRv'&gt;see the demo here though&lt;/a&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>In this case the symbols automatically double up when the end of your specified sequence is reached. You can add the <code>cyclic</code> keyword to prevent this. The default behaviour is <code>symbolic</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>ul {\n\tlist-style: symbols(cyclic \"🌑\" \"🌓\" \"🌕\" \"🌗\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/blog/css-symbols-list-2.jpg\" alt=\"The symbols, assigned in the above code block, rendered in Firefox\" title=\"At the time of writing, this only works in Firefox. You can still &lt;a href='https://codepen.io/clagnut/pen/qENVePa'&gt;see the demo here though&lt;/a&gt;\" /></p>\n<p>You can also specify that your symbols sequence is <code>numeric</code> like decimals …7 8 9 10 11… or <code>alphabetic</code> like …a b c aa ab ac ba…, or use <code>fixed</code> to revert to default numbering once your custom symbols run out – useful if you’re specifying a sequence like ① ②…⑧ ⑨.</p>\n<p><em>However,</em> the <code>symbols()</code> function is <strong>only supported in Firefox</strong>, with no interest from <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299922\">Webkit</a> or <a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/484510686\">Chromium</a> at the time of writing. In theory you can also specify a sequence of images, but this is not supported in any browser.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-counter-styles/#symbols-function\">CSS spec</a> says <q>The <code>symbols()</code> function allows a counter style to be defined inline in a property value, for when a style is used only once in a stylesheet and defining a full <code>@counter-style</code> rule would be overkill.</q>. And this brings us to some good news.</p>\n<h2>Defining your own numbering sequence</h2>\n<p>The <code>@counter-style</code> rule enables you to further specify exactly what symbols or text appear in your list markers, and in what order or combination. You can use it to replicate all the <code>symbols()</code>  and <code>::marker</code> content functionality we’ve seen so far, and cross-browser is support is good – it became <a href=\"https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/counter-style/\">Baseline Newly Available</a> in September 2023.</p>\n<p>This is how to use <code>@counter-style</code> to achieve the <code>symbols()</code> examples we looked at earlier. This will work across all modern browsers today:</p>\n<pre><code>@counter-style --footnotes {\n  system: symbolic;\n  symbols: '*' † ‡ §;\n  suffix: \" \";\n}\n\n@counter-style --moons {\n  system: cyclic;\n  symbols: 🌑 🌓 🌕 🌗;\n  suffix: \" \";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which you apply to your lists using the <code>list-style</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code>ol.footnotes { \tlist-style: --footnotes; }\nul.moons { list-style: --moons; }\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/bNeYXOz\">Lists: example 7 - @counter-style demo</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>Similarly one of the marker examples attempted to use a 👉️ for all its bullets. You can achieve that effect cross-browser like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@counter-style --point {\n  system: cyclic;\n  symbols: 👉️;\n  suffix: \" \";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/WbxXVPW\">Lists: example 8 - @counter-style example with pointing hand bullets</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>These counter style examples consist of four parts. The first is a name for the style, such as <code>--point</code>. You can call the counter styles pretty much what you want. You don’t need to prefix them with <code>--</code> although I find it good practise to do so in order to be consistent with naming custom properties. The other parts of the rule are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>system</code> which sets the algorithm used for how the counter works. This takes the same keywords as the <code>symbols()</code> function described earlier, plus <code>additive</code> and <code>extends</code> which we’ll come to later.</li>\n<li><code>symbols</code> is a space separated list of numbers or bullets (in theory this can also take images but there’s no support at the time of writing). Some characters need to be quoted such as <code>*</code>  – to be safe you could put all the characters inside quotes, but generally you don’t need to.</li>\n<li><code>suffix</code> is the character or characters inserted after the counter (a simple space in our examples so far).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For completeness, counter style rules also take the following descriptors, some of which are more niche than others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>prefix</code> is the character or characters inserted before the counter</li>\n<li><code>negative</code> sets the characters before and after a negative counter value. For example, specifying <code>negative: \"(\" \")\"</code> will wrap negative counters in parentheses, which is sometimes used in financial contexts, like “(2) (1) 0 1 2 3…”. It’s fair to say there are very few use cases for negatively numbered ordered lists, however this is still a good opportunity to specify a proper minus symbol instead of a hyphen, just in case: <code>negative: \"−\"</code>.</li>\n<li><code>pad</code> gives you a fixed-width style of numbering by repeating a character before the counter such that all counters are the same width. In reality this means zero-padded decimal numbering. So if you know that your ordered list goes up to less than a thousand, you can specify <code>pad: 3 \"0\"</code> to ensure that all counters are (at least) 3 digits wide. This will cause 1 to be shown as \"001\", 20 as \"020\", 300 as \"300\", 4000 as \"4000\", and -5 as \"-05\" (still three characters wide).</li>\n<li><code>range</code> enables you apply counter styling to specific ranges in the ordered list. For example adding <code>range: 3 5, 20 infinite</code> will only apply styles to list items with counters 3,4 ,5 and anything 20 and above. All other list items will get the default style of numbering.</li>\n<li><code>speak-as</code> describes how assistive technologies should synthesise the spoken form of a counter. Our earlier example had <code>symbols: 🌑 🌓 🌕 🌗</code>. To prevent the browser introducing each list item with something like ‘first quarter moon’, you could set <code>speak-as: bullets</code> so they are introduced like a normal unordered list. See <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/css-counter-styles-3/#counter-style-speak-as\">the spec</a> for more options. Only Safari supports this at the moment but it’s a good candidate for progressive enhancement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more examples and creative uses of <code>@counter-style</code> see <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/some-things-you-might-not-know-about-custom-counter-styles/\">Geoff Graham’s CSS Tricks article</a>.</p>\n<p>Thinking back to our other marker example, we followed the number by a closing parenthesis instead of a full stop. This is a perfect use case for the <code>extends</code> system. Instead of starting from scratch and working out how to define decimal counting in a counter style, we can ‘extend’ the existing decimal style. You might like to think of <code>extends</code> as meaning ‘modifies’. Here’s how:</p>\n<pre><code>@counter-style --decimalparen {\n  system: extends decimal;\n  suffix: \") \";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/ByzJQYX\">Lists: example 9 - @counter-style demo of 'extends' system</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>You can’t include a <code>symbols</code> descriptor when extending a counter style as that would imply  you’re defining a brand new style. You can extend any counter system from the standard list-types as well as any named custom counter styles.</p>\n<p>The space character in the suffixed <code>\") \"</code>  exposes a slight inconsistency between browsers. If you take the space away you’ll see that Chrome and Firefox position the marker flush against the list item text. However Safari always introduces a gap, which you can’t remove. Most of the time this difference is subtle and inconsequential, but once you start heavily customising your markers it can be more obvious. This is particularly true if you’re increasing the font size of your markers, but as we saw earlier that brought its own problem with the marker being aligned to the first line of text.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Creating your own marker box</h2>\n<p>The only solution to all these inconveniences is to remove the <code>::marker</code> pseudo element and create your own in such a way that you can style it to your specific purposes.</p>\n<p>Firstly remove the marker pseudo element by applying <code>list-style:none</code> to your list:</p>\n<pre><code>ol {\n\tlist-style: none;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Having done that, Safari will no longer announce your list to assistive software. To rectify this, tell browsers this really is a list by applying an ARIA role:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;ol role=\"list\"&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;First item.\n\t  &lt;ol role=\"list\"&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;li&gt;Nested item.&lt;/li&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/ol&gt;\n\t&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Second item.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now create your own placeholder for the counter by creating <code>::before</code> pseudo elements and moving them into the margin. Then use generated content to display the counter using the <code>counter()</code> function.</p>\n<pre><code>ol[role='list'] li::before {\n\tdisplay:inline-block;\n\twidth:4ch;\n\tpadding-inline-end:1ch;\n\tmargin-inline-start:-5ch;\n\ttext-align:right;\n\tfont-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* make the numbers line up nicely */\n\n\tcontent: counter(list-item) \".\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/KwMZNYa\">Lists: example 10 - generating custom list marker elements using li::before</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>The <code>counter()</code> function takes a counter name, which you can specify. In this case we’ve used  <code>list-item</code> which is a special name reserved as an <dfn>implicit counter</dfn> for the list being styled. It outputs the position of the list item.</p>\n<p>You can also output the position of all the list numbers in nested sequence, separated by a character or string. To do this use the <code>counters()</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code>ol[role='list'] li::before {\n\tcontent: counters(list-item,\".\") \":\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/MYerbMv\">Lists: example 11 - demo of counters() function for nested numbering</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>If you want your list to start at 1 and increment by 1 each time, you don’t need to do anything else provided you use <code>list-item</code> as your counter name. Otherwise you can reset or create a new counter, set its starting point (the default is 0) and increment by a defined amount for each list item:</p>\n<pre><code>ol[role='list'].mylist {\n\tlist-style: none;\n\tcounter-reset: --myList 3;\n}\n\nol[role='list'].mylist li {\n\tcounter-increment: --myList 2;\n}\n\nol[role='list'].mylist li::before {\n\tcontent: counter(--myList) \". \";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/QwEaQqw\">Lists: example 12 - counter reset and increment</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>You can use <code>counter-increment</code> with any selector meaning you can just as easily number headings in sequence:</p>\n<pre><code>h2 {\n\tcounter-increment: --h2;\n}\n\nh2::before {\n\tcontent: counter(--h2) \". \";\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/VYjyQrB\">Lists: example 13 - automatically numbering headings</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>If all you want to do is set the start number for a list or adjust an item’s value, you don’t need to use CSS, you can do it in HTML using <code>start</code> and <code>value</code>. If you want to have the list items count down instead of up you’ll need to specify that in HTML with a <code>reverse</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;ol start=\"42\"&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;First item starts at 42&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;This one is then 43&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;And we end on 44&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;This is number 1&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li value=\"42\"&gt;This is number 42&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;It follows that this is 43&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>&lt;ol reversed start=\"44\"&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Counting down from 44&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Now we're at 43&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;The final answer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/ByzJYVX\">Lists: example 14 - HTML start, value and reversed</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<h2>Tying it all together</h2>\n<p>Finally let’s use some of what we’ve learned to create this list:</p>\n<p></p><p>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/ZYOOReL\">Lists: example 15 - fancy list markers</a> by Andy Bell (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/piccalilli/\">@piccalilli</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p><p></p>\n<p>Here’s the full CSS which we’ll walk through afterwards:</p>\n<pre><code>ul[role='list'] {\n  list-style: none;\n  max-inline-size:23em;\n  padding-inline-start:2.5em;\n  line-height:1.25em;\n}\n\nul[role='list'] li {\n  margin-block-end:1lh;\n  min-block-size: 2lh;\n  position:relative;\n  text-box: trim-start cap alphabetic;\n}\n\n@counter-style --fleurons {\n  system: cyclic;\n  symbols: ❦ ✾ ✤ ❈ ✺ ❥;\n  suffix: \"\";\n  speak-as: bullets;\n}\n\nul[role='list'] li::before {\n  position:absolute;\n  inset-block-start: 0;\n  inset-inline-start: -1.25em;\n  inline-size:1em;\n  text-box: trim-start cap alphabetic;\n  text-align:end;\n  font-size:2lh;\n  line-height:1;\n  font-weight:bold;\n  color: hsl(3, 70%, 55%);\n  content: counter(list-item, --fleurons);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Breakdown</h3>\n<p>Looking at each rule individually:</p>\n<pre><code>ul[role='list'] {\n  list-style: none;\n  max-inline-size:23em;\n  padding-inline-start:2.5em;\n  line-height:1.25em;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We start by removing the default bullets, remembering to tell assistive software the list is still a list.

These will cycle round if we end up with more than six list items. We make sure they are announced  as ‘bullet’ rather than ‘rotated heavy black heart’, etc.</p>\n<pre><code>ul[role='list'] li::before {\n  position:absolute;\n  inset-block-start: 0;\n  inset-inline-start: -1.25em;\n  inline-size:1em;\n  text-box: trim-start cap alphabetic;\n  text-align:end;\n  font-size:2lh;\n  line-height:1;\n  font-weight:bold;\n  color: hsl(3, 70%, 55%);\n  content: counter(list-item, --fleurons);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally we create pseudo elements before each list item and absolutely position them off to the side, leaving a 0.25em gap. We want the bullets to nicely span two lines of text, so we make the font size <code>2lh</code>, remove any half-leading by setting the line height to <code>1</code>,  and trim the text box to the top of the capitals so it aligns with our list text. Finally we make the bullet bold and red, and write it to the page using generated content by way of the <code>list-item</code> implicit counter and our <code>--fleurons</code> counter style.</p>\n\n<p>There could be a case for using anchor positioning here, however good old fashioned absolute positioning has 100% support and provides a very simple solution to the task at hand.</p>\n\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>Phew.

    "title": "You might not need role=\"presentation\"",
    "partialText": "<p>For a brief moment in time, my main job was to assess the compliance of a selection of websites and document this in a report that was handed over to the customer. I carried out this assessment using the so-called <a href=\"https://bitvtest.de/en/tests-und-beratung/bik-bitv-test-web\">BIK BITV test</a> and, in test step <a href=\"https://bitvtest.de/pruefschritt/bitv-20-plus-web/bitv-20-plus-web-9-4-1-2-name-rolle-wert-verfuegbar\">9.4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>, I noticed time and again that <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> was used in a way that was either technically questionable or even degraded accessibility.</p>\n<p>Because I have seen this pattern so often, I'm going to to use a couple of real-life examples to find out why this is the case. The examples have been edited and shortened to make them easier to understand.</p>\n<p>I will use the code to assess what the intention for using <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> might have been and what could have been done differently. In my experience, there’s only a few real use cases for this attribute value, which we will get to later in the article.</p>\n<h2>What you might read about this attribute</h2>\n<p>We will use the specifications to take a closer look at what <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> does, how it is used in the wild, and what it should actually be used for.</p>\n<h2>The official specs</h2>\n<div><h2>FYI</h2>\n<p>Whenever you see a blockquote following a code sample in this section, it is an excerpt from the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#presentation\">specification</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#presentation\">specification</a>, you will immediately notice the prominent note right at the beginning (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In ARIA 1.1, the working group introduced none as a synonym to the presentation role, due to author confusion surrounding the intended meaning of the word \"presentation\" or \"presentational.\" Many individuals erroneously consider <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> to be synonymous with <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code>, and we believe <code>role=\"none\"</code> conveys the actual meaning more unambiguously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This gives us an initial indication of why this attribute might be used incorrectly.</p>\n<p>Authors seem to understand “presentational” as “only to be seen”; not heard. This is the behaviour of <code>aria-hidden</code>, which hides an element in the accessibility tree so that it is no longer announced when assistive technology is used. <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> only affects the role, but not an element and its content.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The intended use is when an element is used to change the look of the page but does not have all the functional, interactive, or structural relevance implied by the element type, or may be used to provide for an accessible fallback in older browsers that do not support WAI-ARIA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spoiler: they’re describing layout tables here, which we’ll get into later in the article.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An element whose content is completely presentational (like a spacer image, decorative graphic, or clearing element);</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first two examples sound like image elements. If it is a decorative <code>svg</code> element, <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> would make more sense. Whereas for an <code>img</code> element <code>alt=\"\"</code> would be more appropriate for hiding it, as this makes the intention much more obvious and it comes for free with the <code>img</code> element.</p>\n<p>“Clearing element” might refer to using an element to clear float behaviour, where you would use <code>clear: both;</code> after using <code>float: left;</code> or <code>float: right;</code>, so it wouldn’t get dragged up the flow and break the layout.</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An image that is in a container with the <code>img</code> role and where the full text alternative is available and is marked up with <code>aria-labelledby</code> and (if needed) <code>aria-describedby</code>;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be completely honest, I have never seen the following example in the wild, and it is much easier to implement — and for users to read — if you use the <code>alt</code> attribute for alternative text in an image.</p>\n<p>In the following example, the <code>hidden</code> attribute is used to hide the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element visually. However, it’s still available in the DOM, so it can be referenced using <code>aria-labelledby</code> , up there in the sibling <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, for example.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div role=\"img\" aria-labelledby=\"image-title\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"example-image.jpg\" role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n  &lt;span id=\"image-title\" hidden&gt;A beautiful sunset over the ocean&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the accessibility tree, in that context, the image is displayed correctly with the corresponding alternative text, but not the source URL. If you use <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/linter/\">axe-linter</a> in development, removing <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> will trigger an alarm that images need alternative text.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An element used as an additional markup \"hook\" for CSS [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that in CSS, you use this attribute to target an element with <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>, for example like this:</p>\n<pre><code>table[role=presentation] {\n  /* Do something */\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A layout table and/or any of its associated rows, cells, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, we’ll get into this pattern later on.</p>\n<p>The specification contains many more explanations and examples, which you are welcome to look at yourself. One of the most important sentences for me is this one: <em>“[…] the presentation role causes a given element to be treated as having no role or to be removed from the accessibility tree, but does not cause the content contained within the element to be removed from the accessibility tree.”</em></p>\n<p>The following example is not intended for use in production, but is only meant to illustrate that when using <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>, the element itself and the elements within it lose their semantic meaning, but the content is still available:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- Output: One generic element containing \ntwo generic elements with content. --&gt;\n&lt;ul role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; More Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Output: Unordered list element containing two list items. --&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; More Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The semantic HTML is still displayed in the source code, however, if you look at them in the accessibility tree, they are displayed as generic elements, so they could just as well be <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements.</p>\n<p>Enough theory, let’s have a look at some real world examples!</p>\n<h2>Questionable examples</h2>\n<p>Some of these examples won’t create any real barriers for users and I consider them not nice, but more <em>harmless</em>. Others will cause problems, because <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> has removed important semantic meaning, which can cause more issues because of nested elements.</p>\n<p>You will quickly learn that I removed this attribute in <em>all</em> of my suggested fixes, as it’s just <strong>not necessary</strong>. It was also sometimes impossible for me to guess why developers used <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> in the first place.</p>\n<h3>The “invisible” <code>iframe</code> element</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=\"...\" title role=\"presentation\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"width: 0px; height: 0px; border: 0px; display: none;\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This <code>iframe</code> element contains a single <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element for cookie logic. The intention here was most likely to hide it from assistive technology, as the CSS code suggests.</p>\n<p>However, the content is still available because only the semantic meaning was removed from the <code>iframe</code> element. In addition, a <code>title</code> attribute without content was used here, which is incorrect.</p>\n<p>Instead, the desired output could be implemented as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;iframe aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"...\" loading=\"eager\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>The list with no items</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\n\t  &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n\t  \t&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;To homepage&lt;/a&gt;\n\t  &lt;/li&gt;\n\t  &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n\t&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> is applied to a list element here is beyond me. Especially since this is a navigation element and the semantics here have to be on point. Fortunately, it can be easily fixed by removing the attribute and using <code>aria-current=\"page\"</code> for the current page.</p>\n<h3>The “hidden” image</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/shop\" aria-label=\"Shop\"&gt;\n  &lt;svg role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Shopping cart&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>As we learned from the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#presentation\">specification</a>, <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> only removes the semantics of an element, but not its content, so the content of the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element should still be available, right? As <code>aria-label</code> is present, an accessible name is provided by this attribute, but <em>not</em> the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element itself.</p>\n<p>If you would remove <code>aria-label</code>, it would have no accessible name at all, meaning <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> has completely purged the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element from the accessibility tree! 🤯</p>\n<p>The goal here was probably to hide the alternative text of the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element, which worked. However, there are several ways to solve this use case more cleanly, and I would do it this way:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/shop\"&gt;\n  &lt;svg&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Shop&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, we do not need <code>aria-label</code>, as the alternative text of the image is used as the accessible name.</p>\n<h3>Make it semantic, then undo it</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/retail\"&gt;\n  &lt;p role=\"presentation\"&gt;Search store&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is an awkward solution, but it does not present any real barriers for users, as the link text is still available. The developers probably wanted to hide the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element semantically, which is exactly what happens here. However, it could also have been done like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/retail\"&gt;\n  Search store\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Technically meh, but still working</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;div role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n  &lt;section role=\"presentation\" aria-label=\"Header\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n  &lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a very interesting case! First of all, I don't understand why you would remove the semantic meaning but still use a semantic element.</p>\n<p>In theory, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> would be a generic element with an aria-label, which is prohibited according to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#generic\">specification</a>, which would result in a failure of test step <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value\">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</a>.</p>\n<p>But because <code>aria-label</code> is present, this is ignored by the browser and the element is displayed correctly in the accessibility tree. Amazing! A technically clean solution would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;section aria-label=\"Header\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n  &lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Adding an accessible name and then removing it</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/profile\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;img alt=\"Go to profile\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"...\"&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The intention is not clear to me here either, because there are some problems due to <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element needs an accessible name, which is not available because the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element has no semantic meaning and the <code>alt</code> attribute cannot be applied to a generic element.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, these problems can be solved by removing <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>! I also removed the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements because personally, I don’t like the taste of <a href=\"https://cdn.matthewjamestaylor.com/img/gmail-div-soup.png\">div soup</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/profile\"&gt;\n  &lt;img alt=\"Go to profile\" src=\"...\"&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The alternative text is now linked to the image, and the accessible name of the link is provided by the alternative text. This one is similar to the “hidden” image example from earlier.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The few good use cases of this attribute</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of suggestions in the specs when you <em>could</em> use <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>, but I think only a few use cases could apply: <a href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/\">Tabbed interfaces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stevefrenzel.dev/posts/menu-and-navigation-the-difference/#menu-example\">menu pattern</a> and a layout table. Let’s have a closer look at a layout table, which is using a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element for page layout.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://nerdy.dev/cascading-secret-sauce\">modern CSS</a>, there’s no real need to use layout tables for websites anymore! We can produce <a href=\"https://every-layout.dev/\">flexible and robust designs by using flexbox and / or grid</a>. The one use case where <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> might come in handy <em>could</em> be email templates though.</p>\n<p>If you are forced to use layout tables for your emails, Harvard University has a great article for you on <a href=\"https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/creating-accessible-emails\">creating accessible emails</a>. The most relevant part for this article is the following sentence (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you must use tables for layout, add the attribute <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> on every table element to ensure screen readers won’t treat them as data tables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/tips/\">W3C Tips and Tricks section for tables</a>, they’re also <em>very</em> clear on the usage of layout tables (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tables should not be used for layout purposes. Use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for layout. If there are already layout tables present, don’t use structural elements (like <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>) [...], and do add <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://accessibility.umich.edu/basics/concepts-principles/tables\">University of Michigan</a> keeps it more brief but same advice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only use tables to present tabular data, not to create a visual layout. Use CSS or styling options to handle layout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://brothercake.com/Ref/presentational-tables.html\">Screen reader heuristics for presentational tables</a>, you’ll find some examples on how to use <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> in the context of a layout table.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Thanks to a detailed analysis of the specifications, we have learned what <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> does and how few use cases there actually are for this attribute. We have also seen from real-life examples how misunderstood the functionality of this attribute is among developers.</p>\n<p>The only real use cases would be tabbed interfaces, the menu pattern and email templates, but even here, one could (if possible) switch to plain text emails and avoid using <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://heydonworks.com/\">Heydon Pickering</a> for their help checking over this article and lending us their endless accessibility wisdom.</p>",
