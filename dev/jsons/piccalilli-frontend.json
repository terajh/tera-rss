    "partialText": "<p>As promised in the <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/projects/personal-site/2\">last one</a>, we'll wrap up planning today. This stuff is the more fun to do though!</p>\n<h2>The tools</h2>\n<p>I know it's what you want to see, so let's get into what I'm using for this project.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://bell.bz/uses/\">uses</a> is here too.</p>\n<h3>Planning and organising</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a></strong> for tracking what needs to be done, lists and notes</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.tldraw.com/\">tldraw</a>;</strong> for sketching/mapping</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.affinity.studio/\">Affinity</a></strong> for vectors and photoshop-like work</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://penpot.app/\">Penpot</a></strong> for UI design</li>\n<li><strong>HTML, CSS and web components</strong> for prototyping</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Website system</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Navi</strong> for the pattern library/design system (this is our internal software that we use in <a href=\"https://set.studio/\">the studio</a>)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://astro.build/\">Astro</a></strong> for the front-end framework</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sugarcube.sh/\">sugarcube</a></strong> for CSS utilities and converting design tokens to custom properties</li>\n<li><strong>HTML, CSS and web components</strong>: to make everything look good and work nicely</li>\n</ul>\n<div><h2>FYI</h2>\n<h3>Why are you not using the tool(s) I like?</h3>\n<p>My chosen \"stack\" works very well for my day-to-day work. I'm sure your favourites are great too!</p>\n<h3>No AI?</h3>\n<p>Why eat nice food when you could just eat gruel, eh?</p>\n<h3>Why Astro and not Eleventy</h3>\n<p>I <em>really</em> like Eleventy. I even wrote a <a href=\"https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/\">course about it</a> in 2020! I've found Astro to be fantastic to work with for this site and lots of client stuff in <a href=\"https://set.studio/\">the studio</a>.</p>\n<p>I'll also be using the <code>/api</code> routes, so for that reason alone, it makes sense to use Astro.</p>\n<h3>Why not Figma and Adobe Creative Suite?</h3>\n<p>Those tools are redundant (for us) with Affinity and Penpot available. I'm actively (as <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/author/jason-bradberry/\">Jason</a> will attest) trying to remove Figma from our toolset too because — <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/blog/the-open-source-design-stack/#:~:text=Figma%E2%80%99s%20aforementioned%20chokehold,always%20benefit%20us.\">as Scott outlines</a> — they're a grim company.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Existing page audit</h2>\n<p>The aim of the game here is to surface the current pages landscape.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/penpot-page-audit.jpg\" alt=\"A Penpot file that has every page type from my existing site mapped out next to each other in labelled sections\" /></p>\n<p>I like to do this process for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I like to be able to draw all over it in a sketch up plan (which I cover in <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/complete-css?utm_medium=author-promo\">Complete CSS</a> FYI) to help me work out what patterns I need to account for</li>\n<li>It's a useful method of seeing the scale of the design job I've got ahead of me</li>\n<li>I can keep referring back to this audit to make sure I've either got a pattern covered, or I've removed the need for it all together</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Map out data sources and their URL segments</h2>\n<p>I like to do this with a pen/stylus when I'm doing a project on my own, but for a client project, we'd usually use Figma/Penpot because expecting other people to read my handwriting is asking too much (as you will see).</p>\n<p>I did this part in two passes. The optimistic pass, then after a couple of days (to freshen my mind), the pragmatic pass.</p>\n<h3>Optimistic pass</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/optimistic-data-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"A hand-drawn digital flowchart mapping out website architecture and data flow\" /></p>\n<p>I can only apologise for my awful handwriting.</p>\n<p>As I covered earlier in the series, blog content comes from an existing headless WordPress system and the Bluesky/AT protocol posts (and in the future, interactions and discussion) come from the <a href=\"https://npmx.dev/package/@atproto/api\"><code>@atproto/api</code></a> client library.</p>\n<p>The original idea was to merge WordPress and AT Protocol data into a shared <code>/feed</code> route and then, based on type/source, render in different sections of the site. The music collection will always be treated as its own little ecosystem.</p>\n\nThe `[..slug]`, `[...page]` and `[...did]` parts reference [Astro dynamic routes](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes).\n\n<p>Everything in this pass is idealistic. Now let's get pragmatic.</p>\n<h3>Pragmatic pass</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/pragmatic-data-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"Another hand-drawn digital flowchart but this time, it's been simplified\" /></p>\n<p>The sections are near-enough the same, but there are less arrows. With fresh eyes, I rightly considered how stinky merging two different types could be, both technologically and creatively, so I simplified that. There's no more stream crossing, as it were.</p>\n<p>I also did exactly what I said I would need to do in the last post too: I <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/projects/personal-site/2#find-the-pain-points-and-measure-against-them:~:text=The%20list%20to%20measure%20against\">measured this idea against the list of problems I was trying to solve</a> and I couldn't in good faith tell you that point 2 — <em>\"The codebase is difficult to maintain and I’ve carried over tech debt from multiple personal sites and half-baked ideas\"</em> — would not be put at risk.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/personal-site-core-features.jpg\" alt=\"An Obsidian markdown file called &quot;core features and iterations.&quot; It lists a development roadmap across four iterations, including tasks like &quot;basic shell version of the site,&quot; &quot;look and feel design,&quot; &quot;AT protocol integration,&quot; and &quot;last.fm integration.&quot;\" /></p>\n<p>I'd also mapped out the deeper integration with the AT protocol in iteration three, so at that point — especially as this is a <em>new</em> addition to the site — I'll render individual posts and <em>hopefully</em> all of the replies and interactions.</p>\n<p>I'd also quite like to detect and give my own threads their own specific treatment too because I like to <em>go off</em> Online</p>\n<div><h2>FYI</h2>\n<p>For the home page and static pages, we're using a simple, static data system that I'll explain when we get to it in a few posts time.</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Sketching and prioritisation</h2>\n<p>Ok, the last pit stop on our planning tour is to do a bit more sketching, but this time, the focus is on content prioritisation. Aside from the blog, music-collection and posts, the three most important pages are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The home page</li>\n<li>The about page</li>\n<li>The links page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As I identified in the last post, one of the most important problems to fix is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The homepage is underwhelming and doesn’t communicate what I do well at all</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd say the same for the about page too. For too long on the web, I've leaned into reputation and social graph, but what about people who've never heard of me or seen me around? I need to make it clear to those people especially what I'm about.</p>\n<p>For the links page, I quite like the idea of a <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/\">Linktree</a>, \"link in bio\" sort of thing without all the KPI-chasing <em>weight</em>, so it's worth sketching that too.</p>\n<p>What is very important when doing this sort of work is that you do it <em>fast</em>. Your tool of choice needs to work as fast as your brain does. Sure, you can make a neater version of these guides if you need to collaborate, <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/blog/redesigning-piccalilli-the-first-part-of-the-design-process/#sprint-one\">like we did here</a>, but working fast and loose helps my brain, especially, remain in a focused state. If I'm faffing around aligning stuff and making stuff neat, it's busywork.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/priority-guide-sketch.jpg\" alt=\"A priority guide / wireframe that's also digitally done by hand\" /></p>\n<p>Maybe I should have been a doctor with this handwriting.</p>\n<p>What an absolute shambles, eh? Let me break down what's going on here. I first sketch out blocks of content in priority order, from top to bottom. Sure there's a <em>bit</em> of layout going on, but generally this is vertically ordered blocks.</p>\n<p>One thing to note here is that none of this process is designed to inspire UI design. Just content priority. </p>\n<p>After I got the priority sorted, I then went ahead, annotated with blue and commented with red. This is a me thing: I need the different colours so specific types of information stick out from each other. Mostly I'm either identifying <em>what</em> an element does, or if it's repeatable.</p>\n<p>Notice on the about page I didn't re-create the blocks of content? There's no point, when I can make a note that I have a repeat of the homepage or a variant of that. This is mostly there to remind me to consider both contexts when I come to do the actual UI design. I also want to retain the longform prose on my about page, but that is <em>less</em> important, priority-wise, so it gets pushed down.</p>\n<p>I mapped out the links page too — I'm looking forward to working this part out especially in design. In terms of prioritisation it's pretty straightforward. \"Repeat of most important\" means links like Piccalilli and Set Studio, followed by icon-based social network links. This will help me map out the Astro collections too.</p>\n<p>Lastly, because <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/blog/in-praise-of-off-screen-menus/\">I am also a big fan of a good off screen menu</a>, I'm going to give myself that creative freedom. I just needed to work out <em>what</em> went in there, aside from navigation. I've settled on links to important stuff and expanding into a sub-navigation where appropriate. For example, the sub-navigation of the music collection might free me up to simplify the music collection layout itself.</p>\n<h2>Determine an order of operations</h2>\n<p>Now I have all of this planning done and I've got my iterations worked out, I can quickly map out the order of operations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Planning (done)</li>\n<li>Sketching and priority guides (done)</li>\n<li>HTML only shell of the site with shell components\n<ul>\n<li>Aside task: creative inspiration and scrapbooking</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Creative UI design and prototyping</li>\n<li>Core build, including design system, followed by full pages</li>\n<li>Flair pass and nice touches</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You see that? We're getting into some coding in the next one: the start of getting to the website's current state (at the time of writing).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/personal-site-initial-live-version.jpg\" alt=\"My homepage looking very simple with a picture of me and some prose. There's a banner at the top explaining that this is a wireframe version of the site. \" /></p>\n<p>See you in the next one!</p>",
