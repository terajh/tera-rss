Why, I remember back when <a href=\"https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/?utm_source=the-index&amp;utm_medium=newsletter\">Paul Irish first boldly proposed the use of</a> <code>* { box-sizing: border-box }</code>, lo those many years ago.</p>\n<p>Sure, maybe the holiday has become a little commercial since then, but leave us not forget the the true meaning of the season: that time we all agreed that early Internet Explorer <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/the-revenge-of-the-ie-box-model?utm_source=the-index&amp;utm_medium=newsletter\">got one thing right</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://npmx.dev/?utm_source=the-index&amp;utm_medium=newsletter\">npmx</a></h2>\n<p>npmx is intended to serve as an improved user interface for the npm registry — not a new package manager, just a better way to browse what npm has on offer. I'm certainly not gonna argue with that; I think it looks great.</p>\n<p>Maybe just as noteworthy, though, is the <em>explosive</em> community development effort that has gone into building it over the past few weeks.

    "partialText": "<p>For a brief moment in time, my main job was to assess the compliance of a selection of websites and document this in a report that was handed over to the customer. I carried out this assessment using the so-called <a href=\"https://bitvtest.de/en/tests-und-beratung/bik-bitv-test-web\">BIK BITV test</a> and, in test step <a href=\"https://bitvtest.de/pruefschritt/bitv-20-plus-web/bitv-20-plus-web-9-4-1-2-name-rolle-wert-verfuegbar\">9.4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>, I noticed time and again that <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> was used in a way that was either technically questionable or even degraded accessibility.</p>\n<p>Because I have seen this pattern so often, I'm going to to use a couple of real-life examples to find out why this is the case. The examples have been edited and shortened to make them easier to understand.</p>\n<p>I will use the code to assess what the intention for using <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> might have been and what could have been done differently. In my experience, there’s only a few real use cases for this attribute value, which we will get to later in the article.</p>\n<h2>What you might read about this attribute</h2>\n<p>We will use the specifications to take a closer look at what <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> does, how it is used in the wild, and what it should actually be used for.</p>\n<h2>The official specs</h2>\n<div><h2>FYI</h2>\n<p>Whenever you see a blockquote following a code sample in this section, it is an excerpt from the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#presentation\">specification</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#presentation\">specification</a>, you will immediately notice the prominent note right at the beginning (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In ARIA 1.1, the working group introduced none as a synonym to the presentation role, due to author confusion surrounding the intended meaning of the word \"presentation\" or \"presentational.\" Many individuals erroneously consider <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> to be synonymous with <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code>, and we believe <code>role=\"none\"</code> conveys the actual meaning more unambiguously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This gives us an initial indication of why this attribute might be used incorrectly.</p>\n<p>Authors seem to understand “presentational” as “only to be seen”; not heard. This is the behaviour of <code>aria-hidden</code>, which hides an element in the accessibility tree so that it is no longer announced when assistive technology is used. <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> only affects the role, but not an element and its content.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The intended use is when an element is used to change the look of the page but does not have all the functional, interactive, or structural relevance implied by the element type, or may be used to provide for an accessible fallback in older browsers that do not support WAI-ARIA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spoiler: they’re describing layout tables here, which we’ll get into later in the article.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An element whose content is completely presentational (like a spacer image, decorative graphic, or clearing element);</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first two examples sound like image elements. If it is a decorative <code>svg</code> element, <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> would make more sense. Whereas for an <code>img</code> element <code>alt=\"\"</code> would be more appropriate for hiding it, as this makes the intention much more obvious and it comes for free with the <code>img</code> element.</p>\n<p>“Clearing element” might refer to using an element to clear float behaviour, where you would use <code>clear: both;</code> after using <code>float: left;</code> or <code>float: right;</code>, so it wouldn’t get dragged up the flow and break the layout.</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An image that is in a container with the <code>img</code> role and where the full text alternative is available and is marked up with <code>aria-labelledby</code> and (if needed) <code>aria-describedby</code>;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be completely honest, I have never seen the following example in the wild, and it is much easier to implement — and for users to read — if you use the <code>alt</code> attribute for alternative text in an image.</p>\n<p>In the following example, the <code>hidden</code> attribute is used to hide the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element visually. However, it’s still available in the DOM, so it can be referenced using <code>aria-labelledby</code> , up there in the sibling <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, for example.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div role=\"img\" aria-labelledby=\"image-title\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"example-image.jpg\" role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n  &lt;span id=\"image-title\" hidden&gt;A beautiful sunset over the ocean&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the accessibility tree, in that context, the image is displayed correctly with the corresponding alternative text, but not the source URL. If you use <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/linter/\">axe-linter</a> in development, removing <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> will trigger an alarm that images need alternative text.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An element used as an additional markup \"hook\" for CSS [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that in CSS, you use this attribute to target an element with <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>, for example like this:</p>\n<pre><code>table[role=presentation] {\n  /* Do something */\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A layout table and/or any of its associated rows, cells, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, we’ll get into this pattern later on.</p>\n<p>The specification contains many more explanations and examples, which you are welcome to look at yourself. One of the most important sentences for me is this one: <em>“[…] the presentation role causes a given element to be treated as having no role or to be removed from the accessibility tree, but does not cause the content contained within the element to be removed from the accessibility tree.”</em></p>\n<p>The following example is not intended for use in production, but is only meant to illustrate that when using <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>, the element itself and the elements within it lose their semantic meaning, but the content is still available:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- Output: One generic element containing \ntwo generic elements with content. --&gt;\n&lt;ul role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; More Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Output: Unordered list element containing two list items. --&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; More Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The semantic HTML is still displayed in the source code, however, if you look at them in the accessibility tree, they are displayed as generic elements, so they could just as well be <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements.</p>\n<p>Enough theory, let’s have a look at some real world examples!</p>\n<h2>Questionable examples</h2>\n<p>Some of these examples won’t create any real barriers for users and I consider them not nice, but more <em>harmless</em>. Others will cause problems, because <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> has removed important semantic meaning, which can cause more issues because of nested elements.</p>\n<p>You will quickly learn that I removed this attribute in <em>all</em> of my suggested fixes, as it’s just <strong>not necessary</strong>. It was also sometimes impossible for me to guess why developers used <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> in the first place.</p>\n<h3>The “invisible” <code>iframe</code> element</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=\"...\" title role=\"presentation\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"width: 0px; height: 0px; border: 0px; display: none;\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This <code>iframe</code> element contains a single <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element for cookie logic. The intention here was most likely to hide it from assistive technology, as the CSS code suggests.</p>\n<p>However, the content is still available because only the semantic meaning was removed from the <code>iframe</code> element. In addition, a <code>title</code> attribute without content was used here, which is incorrect.</p>\n<p>Instead, the desired output could be implemented as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;iframe aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"...\" loading=\"eager\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>The list with no items</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;\n\t&lt;ul&gt;\n\t  &lt;li role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n\t  \t&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;To homepage&lt;/a&gt;\n\t  &lt;/li&gt;\n\t  &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n\t&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> is applied to a list element here is beyond me. Especially since this is a navigation element and the semantics here have to be on point. Fortunately, it can be easily fixed by removing the attribute and using <code>aria-current=\"page\"</code> for the current page.</p>\n<h3>The “hidden” image</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/shop\" aria-label=\"Shop\"&gt;\n  &lt;svg role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Shopping cart&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>As we learned from the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#presentation\">specification</a>, <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> only removes the semantics of an element, but not its content, so the content of the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element should still be available, right? As <code>aria-label</code> is present, an accessible name is provided by this attribute, but <em>not</em> the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element itself.</p>\n<p>If you would remove <code>aria-label</code>, it would have no accessible name at all, meaning <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> has completely purged the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element from the accessibility tree! 🤯</p>\n<p>The goal here was probably to hide the alternative text of the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element, which worked. However, there are several ways to solve this use case more cleanly, and I would do it this way:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/shop\"&gt;\n  &lt;svg&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Shop&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n  &lt;/svg&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, we do not need <code>aria-label</code>, as the alternative text of the image is used as the accessible name.</p>\n<h3>Make it semantic, then undo it</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/retail\"&gt;\n  &lt;p role=\"presentation\"&gt;Search store&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is an awkward solution, but it does not present any real barriers for users, as the link text is still available. The developers probably wanted to hide the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element semantically, which is exactly what happens here. However, it could also have been done like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/retail\"&gt;\n  Search store\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Technically meh, but still working</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;div role=\"presentation\"&gt;\n  &lt;section role=\"presentation\" aria-label=\"Header\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n  &lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a very interesting case! First of all, I don't understand why you would remove the semantic meaning but still use a semantic element.</p>\n<p>In theory, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> would be a generic element with an aria-label, which is prohibited according to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#generic\">specification</a>, which would result in a failure of test step <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value\">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</a>.</p>\n<p>But because <code>aria-label</code> is present, this is ignored by the browser and the element is displayed correctly in the accessibility tree. Amazing! A technically clean solution would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;section aria-label=\"Header\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- More code  --&gt;\n  &lt;/section&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Adding an accessible name and then removing it</h3>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/profile\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;img alt=\"Go to profile\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"...\"&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The intention is not clear to me here either, because there are some problems due to <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element needs an accessible name, which is not available because the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element has no semantic meaning and the <code>alt</code> attribute cannot be applied to a generic element.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, these problems can be solved by removing <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>! I also removed the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements because personally, I don’t like the taste of <a href=\"https://cdn.matthewjamestaylor.com/img/gmail-div-soup.png\">div soup</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"/profile\"&gt;\n  &lt;img alt=\"Go to profile\" src=\"...\"&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The alternative text is now linked to the image, and the accessible name of the link is provided by the alternative text. This one is similar to the “hidden” image example from earlier.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The few good use cases of this attribute</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of suggestions in the specs when you <em>could</em> use <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>, but I think only a few use cases could apply: <a href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/\">Tabbed interfaces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stevefrenzel.dev/posts/menu-and-navigation-the-difference/#menu-example\">menu pattern</a> and a layout table. Let’s have a closer look at a layout table, which is using a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element for page layout.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://nerdy.dev/cascading-secret-sauce\">modern CSS</a>, there’s no real need to use layout tables for websites anymore! We can produce <a href=\"https://every-layout.dev/\">flexible and robust designs by using flexbox and / or grid</a>. The one use case where <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> might come in handy <em>could</em> be email templates though.</p>\n<p>If you are forced to use layout tables for your emails, Harvard University has a great article for you on <a href=\"https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/creating-accessible-emails\">creating accessible emails</a>. The most relevant part for this article is the following sentence (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you must use tables for layout, add the attribute <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> on every table element to ensure screen readers won’t treat them as data tables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/tips/\">W3C Tips and Tricks section for tables</a>, they’re also <em>very</em> clear on the usage of layout tables (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tables should not be used for layout purposes. Use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for layout. If there are already layout tables present, don’t use structural elements (like <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>) [...], and do add <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://accessibility.umich.edu/basics/concepts-principles/tables\">University of Michigan</a> keeps it more brief but same advice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only use tables to present tabular data, not to create a visual layout. Use CSS or styling options to handle layout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://brothercake.com/Ref/presentational-tables.html\">Screen reader heuristics for presentational tables</a>, you’ll find some examples on how to use <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> in the context of a layout table.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Thanks to a detailed analysis of the specifications, we have learned what <code>role=\"presentation\"</code> does and how few use cases there actually are for this attribute. We have also seen from real-life examples how misunderstood the functionality of this attribute is among developers.</p>\n<p>The only real use cases would be tabbed interfaces, the menu pattern and email templates, but even here, one could (if possible) switch to plain text emails and avoid using <code>role=\"presentation\"</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://heydonworks.com/\">Heydon Pickering</a> for their help checking over this article and lending us their endless accessibility wisdom.</p>",

Let's go right to the start of this first iteration to look at the planning that happened.</p>\n<p>I can't stress enough how even a modest amount of pre-thinking, sketching or even just making a checklist beats jumping into a code editor or design tool, regardless of whether you're doing a small ticket at work, building a personal site or even starting a whole client project. Sitting down and thinking <strong>away from the tools</strong> really helps you to consider what is actually important, what is a nice to have, how you measure improvement and importantly, what the process of iterations/cycles look like.</p>\n<p>For me — who works obsessively in iterations — I needed to work out what I would <strong>like</strong> the end goal to look like. With that, I can map out how I get there in sensible iterations. I <em>could</em> just start from zero and work up to the end goal, <em>then</em> publish my website. It's how I usually do it! The reason I want to work in iterations this time though is because I'm <em>determined</em> to have a solid, scalable <em>system</em> that I can tinker with as I please, long into the future, regardless of how my personal technology preferences change over time.</p>\n<p>With all of that in mind, my ideal endpoint is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want my website to be built out of much smaller pieces that culminate in a themeable, light design system where a future redesign is a simpler job of editing a single theme CSS file and switching out some creative assets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm in a lucky position with this project because we've achieved this not once, but twice in <a href=\"https://set.studio/\">the studio</a> already.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/work-tle.jpg\" alt=\"A composition of selected elements from “The Lost Estate” website, featuring bold typography, vintage-inspired illustrations, event details, customer reviews, and booking buttons. The design uses a dark theme with red and gold accents.\" title=\"The Lost Estate are a London based events company who we built a themeable design system for to enable them to spin up event sites that were really creative, but also consistent and performant.\" /></p>\n<p>Then of course there's this very website you're looking at! This whole thing is a themeable system which not only powers dark mode, but also the <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/blog/weve-implemented-full-brands-for-our-upcoming-courses/\">heavily customised course landing pages and courses themselves</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let's get stuck into some planning.</p>\n<h2>Find the pain points and measure against them</h2>\n<p>This is the live version of the final state of my <em>old</em> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260102205804/https://bell.bz/\">codebase on web archive</a>, because remember, <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/projects/personal-site/1/#the-format-and-how-this-series-works\">you're reading these articles in the past</a>. Anyway, that stack was:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Headless WordPress for blog posts</li>\n<li>Notion database for the music collection</li>\n<li>Markdown-powered static pages</li>\n<li>Eleventy front-end</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The setup was not too heavy as far as setups generally go, but it was <em>riddled</em> with technical debt, regardless. A lot of that technical debt can be assigned to it being a personal website — something I built quickly and maintained very infrequently. The codebase was also over 3 years old with the CSS and markup being nearly 5 years old, from when it was a full WordPress site. The source of the technical debt, very much pointed in two places for me though:</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of making good, or at least decent technology choices up front is the damage, even when <em>bad</em>, is never as bad as it <em>could</em> have been.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Notion-powered music collection had to go. The API is slow and working on the site locally was a nightmare (even with caching). I'm also in the process of \"de-Notioning\" everything.</li>\n<li>The WordPress system was wildly out of date and becoming cumbersome to work with in the admin areas, which meant I blogged a lot less than I could have.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's the main sources of technical debt identified, that are worth fixing up front.</p>\n<p>The WordPress one was easy, I just had to <em>update</em> as I was [gulp] several years out of date…</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Notion-powered system was also quite simple. I already have a pretty robust script I use for Piccalilli that pulls content from Notion, turns it into markdown with <a href=\"https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/lesson/4.html\">front matter</a>, then downloads any media assets to a relative, local destination. All I had to do was create a variant of that script, which resulted in <a href=\"https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/personal-site-eleventy/pull/2\">this big ol' pull request to migrate</a> the content.</p>\n<div><h2>FYI</h2>\n<p>I'm not going to go through the script in this series because frankly, it's irrelevant (and janky lol). We'll be getting into a <em>lot</em> more code stuff once this planning is out of the way though, so fret not.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The music collection is now markdown files which look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>---\ntitle: 'The Artist In The Ambulance'\nartist: 'Thrice'\ncover: '1768832680013-335.jpeg'\nformats: ['Vinyl']\ntags: ['Top 10']\npubDate: 2022-03-02T22:08:00.000Z\n---\n</code></pre>\n<p>Who amongst us doesn't manage their music collection at 10pm?</p>\n<p>I already know I'm doing a re-platforming, so I don't need to worry about the lower priority items of technical debt such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript I've sloshed around over the years, so let's now identify the other main issues I'm trying solve, now that I've managed to do a technical debt sweep.</p>\n<h3>The list to measure against</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The homepage is underwhelming and doesn't communicate what I do well at all</li>\n<li>The codebase is difficult to maintain and I've carried over tech debt from multiple personal sites and half-baked ideas</li>\n<li>I don't feel the urge to maintain and look after the current site because I'm fundamentally not a fan of it anymore because it bores me</li>\n<li>The music collection should do more to help people discover music in the places they actually listen to music</li>\n<li>I know I can do much better in terms of look and feel than I have for the last few redesigns</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This list of issues can be used as a measuring stick as I work through the project because if I'm not fixing <em>these</em> issues at least, there's no point in even bothering, as I see it. This list is a useful canonical <em>anchor</em> too.</p>\n<p>The <em>anchor</em> is something to think back to when I'm going off pisté a bit too much and a useful method of determining whether an idea is worth pursuing. If the idea puts any of the items on this list at risk in any way, it's not worth pursuing, which I imagine, will be touched on <em>a lot</em> as I add those <em>nice</em> touches and flourishes that I will undoubtedly take <em>too far</em> in the flair pass.</p>\n<p>The first and fifth issues of the list are actually tangibly related to each other. When I designed the now <em>old</em> version of the site you could sum that process up as \"I spend all day in iA writer so I might as well make my website look like that\". In short, I was <em>lazy</em> and crapped out the front-end in a couple of days. What I really need to be doing is more of a content strategy and look and feel strategy this time around.</p>\n<p>We've also partially tackled point two of the list, but like I said earlier, re-platforming (which we will get to, don't you worry) and re-building <em>properly</em> should sort the rest. In a similar vein, point three <em>should</em> be addressed by the <em>end</em> of this process.</p>\n<h2>Work out the core features</h2>\n<p>I know where I don't want to be and where I <em>want</em> to be at this point in the planning, so it makes sense to actually start working out the core features of the website to find a sensible, iterative route to the end.</p>\n<p>I ended up just making a list in markdown:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/personal-site-core-features.jpg\" alt=\"An Obsidian markdown file called &quot;core features and iterations.&quot; It lists a development roadmap across four iterations, including tasks like &quot;basic shell version of the site,&quot; &quot;look and feel design,&quot; &quot;AT protocol integration,&quot; and &quot;last.fm integration.&quot;\" /></p>\n<p>This is the point I'm making: <em>any</em> planning is better than nothing. If I had just started coding and designing, I might well get to iteration four quicker, but the journey there would forever be in the first cycle in this diagram, I use every day, forever and always.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://piccalil.b-cdn.net/images/projects/course-branding-iteration.svg\" alt=\"A dotted line that starts as a very scruffy, messy circle. Over the course of three more circles, it gets neater and neater until it’s nearly perfect. There's a &quot;we are here&quot; marker pointing at the messiest part\" title=\"The visual representation of how we do things at &lt;a href='https://set.studio/'&gt;Set Studio&lt;/a&gt; and my approach to building in general\" /></p>\n<p>Right, this feels like a good place to break off for this part one of planning. I know, I know, planning is <em>boring</em> but we're gonna be patting ourselves on the back, later in the project, I just <em>know it</em>.</p>\n<p>Let's do some more tangible sketching-based planning, technology-based planning and a touch of auditing in the next one. <em>Then</em> we can open our code editor.</p>",

I'm <a href=\"https://piccalil.li/author/scott-riley/\">Scott Riley</a> and I'm delighted to guest curate this week's issue, where (so I am told) we bring you several absolute banger links for your — I am sure, finely pruned — reading list.</p>\n<p>In case you <a href=\"https://scott.is\">don't know me</a> (and seriously, why would you?) I am predominantly a designer, so we've got a bit more of a design-centric twist this week.</p>\n<p>Thanks for having me!</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://tools.rmv.fyi/?utm_source=the-index&amp;utm_medium=newsletter\">Delphi Tools</a></h2>\n<p>Starting off with a wonderful suite of disparate, hand-crafted, single-(or very-limited-)purpose tools from the fabulous Ruby Morgan Voigt. These are straight-to-the-point, super simple, and convenient. We've got stuff like image cropping, colour palette and gradient generators, typography tools, a regex tester. All beautiful. None hidden behind login-walls or newsletter signups. All running locally in the browser like how things should be too.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://nerdy.dev/nice-select?utm_source=the-index&amp;utm_medium=newsletter\">Nice Select</a></h2>\n<p>Custom select styling is (while still definitely a bit janky) one of my favourite features of modern CSS. Seeing example after example of absolute hell-code creating inconsistent, inaccessible messes in the name of <em>[checks notes]</em> making the clicky rectangle more round and shadowy has, much like every CEO, been a persistent annoyance throughout my career.</p>\n<p>In this fantastic deep-dive, Adam Argyle shows us how we can make the clicky rectangles more round and shadowy <em>without</em> absolutely bastardising our markup in the name of modern visuals.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/vibe-prototyping-isn-t-solving-any-problems-but-it-s-creating-many-new-ones?utm_source=the-index&amp;utm_medium=newsletter\">Vibe prototyping isn't solving any problems. But it's creating many new ones</a></h2>\n<p>The indelible, inimitable Pavel Samsonov produces yet another banger in an ongoing series of bangers. Product Picnic contains some of the most insightful, eloquent, and thought-provoking words you could ever do yourself the favour of smushing into your brain.</p>\n<p>This is one of my favourite issues from recent weeks, and it dives into what a good environment for design should look like, and how AI prototypes often work to the detriment of that. The 'irresistible bait', as Pavel puts it, of vibe-coded prototypes — something that I'm sure many of us have witnessed ensnare folks who we once thought of as serious and scrupulous humans — is having a real impact on how well we can maintain systems and environments where professional work is respected.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/03/nx-s1-5683302/autism-101-misinformation-trump?utm_source=the-index&amp;utm_medium=newsletter\">Autism: myth-busting and what scientists still don't know</a></h2>\n<p>Shocker here: the US Government is full of shit. Amongst the many, many examples of that gang of shrimp-brained shills slapping the presidential seal on a massive sack-load of misinformation, the 'misunderstanding autism as a personal brand' thing comes up time and time again. D*n*ld Tr*mp audio clip jump-scare and Extraordinarily American Speaking Disorder™ aside, this is a good listen from NPR, provided you can get over the liberal throwing-around of <em>interneuron</em>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uif5XmYF7_k?utm_source=the-index&amp;utm_medium=newsletter\">Your weekly medicine</a></h2>\n<p>Hey babe are you okay?
