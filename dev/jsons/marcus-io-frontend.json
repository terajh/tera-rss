    "title": "On Certification",
    "partialText": "<p>First of all: This text is not about the organisation providing and \"running\" these certifications, them being gate-keepers or consisting of people with disabilities - or not (this is a whole other article). Nor it is the topic of this text the exact way of verifying the knowledge and if multiple choice is the best or most inclusive way – or not (another article and topic once again). And thirdly, this text is not about the <em>effect</em> of certifications in the system we're living in, and that some organisations use a certification (with all its inherent challenges states above) as a prerequisite for hiring or booking a professional – and it that is good or bad (third article idea!).</p>\n<p>Rather it is about certifications in an abstract way as a means of showing to others that you understand the topic you claim to  know something about. Seen through this point of view a certification of a certain knowledge is a good idea in my opinion. Let's take drivers' licences for example: While the amount of work and money and prerequisites seem to differ vastly from one country to the next, having one shows others, the police and your country that you have at least the skills to drive a vehicle in theory, that you went through a training of becoming a reasonable motorist at least on paper (or plastic card).</p>\n<p>Using this vantage point and this abstract approach, I wholeheartedly agree with the concept of certification in my field of web accessibility. <a href=\"https://marcus.io/blog/80-20-accessibility\">There, things are easy and hard at the same time</a>, do consist of a great deal of empathy, open-mindedness and social awareness (first and foremost) but also a set of standards, laws, techniques and abstract concepts. An ideal certification verifies in my opinion that all these factors are well understood.</p>\n<p>This becomes especially important when a situation is created where the skills in question are in high economic demand, creating incentives to claim that you have a certain knowledge of helping organisations navigating through areas henceforth mostly unbeknownst to them. And this situation <strong>is</strong> currently unfolding with the European Accessibility Act (EAA) this year and the rise in demand of web accessibility specialists. In  all this jungle of real professionals but also opportunists it is (in an abstract sense) great to have a \"drivers' licence\" system in place, helping at least some of the prospective customers to differentiate snake oil and real knowledge in the field to a certain amount.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/resource/WASBoK_v23pdf\">And therefore I was delighted to work on the latest update of the IAAP Web Accessibility Specialist Body Of Knowledge (PDF) in a consulting role</a> with 14 other Subject Matter Experts from around the world, helping to paint an \"expectations horizon\" of what Web Accessibility Specialist in 2025 <em>should</em> know (and this includes the European Standard, EN 301 549, which becomes relevant for the EAA).</p>\n<p>Critique of this text will be along the lines of \"yeah, but you can regard the certification situation not in an abstract way, but see is in the concrete form with IAAP and all\". To this I'll say: I stopped being a member of IAAP in the fall of last year, will focus my spare time work on improving the certifications only (if I'm invited as Subject Matter Expert again) and am certainly a fan of another organisation running this endeavour (for example a public body without any ties to economic players and with more staff members with visual perveivable disabilities – although I do not discard people not want to disclose their health situation nor the concept of <em>invisible</em> disabilites, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@marcus\">I myself have one</a>).</p>",

    "title": "80 / 20 accessibility",
    "partialText": "<p>Many people are confronted with the topic of web accessibility for the first time as a result of the EAA (European Accessibility Act)  (<em>why this confrontation didn't happen much earlier is another matter...</em>) and are downright afraid of the topic, its complexity and ‘conformity’ per se. And yet I think that this static state in fear is not necessary at all, and that the topic of accessibility, like so many things, follows the Pareto principle and is, in its vast majority, a low-threshold and actionable topic for which there is no need to have a paralysing respect towards.</p>\n<h2>Par-what?</h2>\n<p>The Pareto principle is also known as the ‘80-to-20 rule’ and generally states that 80% of the results can often be achieved with 20% of the total effort (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">more on the principle on Wikipedia</a>). The remaining 20% of the results would require the most work with 80% of the total effort. But even if you simplify the principle established by Vilfredo Pareto to a mere 80-20 distribution, in my opinion there are still many striking parallels to accessibility.</p>\n<p>In my consulting and testing practice, I come across all kinds of barriers and they can certainly be categorised into these two pots. So my observation is that 80% of the subject of accessibility consists of fairly simple basics that can probably be learnt in 20% of the time available. The remaining 20% are the difficult situations, edge cases, assistive technology support gaps and corners of specialised knowledge, but these are extrapolated to 100% of the subject, giving it a bad, anxiety-inducing and difficult reputation overall.</p>\n<h2>Eighty</h2>\n<p>Specifically, I feel 80% of the barriers found in, for example, an audit are aspects that are based on a few fundamentals on the one hand, but are also easy to fix on the other. Some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>alt</code> texts or attributes for images are missing. The fact that an appropriate alternative text version must be provided for non-text content is, on the one hand, the very first success criterion of the WCAG and, on the other hand, a basic principle that is quite easy to understand in my opinion.</li>\n<li>Contrasts do not fulfil the minimum requirements and therefore make the perceptibility of a user interface more difficult. While automatic checkers cannot recognise all cases (e.g. text on images) and in a few cases also misjudge things (<em>false negatives</em>, <em>false positives</em>), they are an (pun intended) accessible way to quickly identify potential accessibility problems and generally familiarise oneself with the topic and the requirements. Overall, there is probably an 80-20 distribution here too.</li>\n<li>The easy-to-learn basic principle of ‘Everything that can be operated with a mouse, for example, must also be operable with a keyboard’ is, in my opinion, easy to understand and easy to implement in the absolute majority of cases as well. This requirement means that keyboard users must always know where they are in the interface (keyword: focus highlighting). Of course, there are also 20% of special cases such as ‘Drag and Drop’, but if you internalise the following principle, you will have done everything right in the absolute majority of cases and - without realising it - made it keyboard operable:</li>\n<li>Another cornerstone of digital documents of all kinds is: <em>Provide metainfos about an element as well, and don't rely on its appearance alone. Explain what an element is so that its role in the context of an overall document is clear. If the element is interactive, explain what it does when interacted with and what state it is in. And then style it (within the framework of contrast guidelines and conventions)</em>. This approach is called semantic HTML and almost always (I would even speak of a 95-to-5 distribution here) also has solid keyboard control built in ‘out of the box’.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Twenty</h2>\n<p>But I also want to give examples for the remaining, challenging 20%:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes ARIA or ARIA patterns are at play, and it's not always obvious exactly what the right approach is or how a particular technology is supported by assistive technology like screen readers. For help with this, <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/\">I can recommend Adrian Rosselli's blog</a>, which is rich in knowledge and offers a vast scope of all things web accessibility. He has a test-supported pool of many different articles on interface elements and situations of all kinds, and also explains how to use ARIA responsibly. I recommend its blog's search function as the be-all and end-all here. Or feed your search engine of your choice with the query \"{problem area} roselli\" and you'll likely find a suiting article.</li>\n<li>When it comes to concrete technical support for ARIA special cases, roles and properties, <a href=\"https://a11ysupport.io/\">a11ysupport.io</a> offers a first starting point for your own testing. It is not quite comparable to <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">CanIUse</a>, but it is the best overview of e.g. screen reader support that we currently have.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another idea for the ‘problematic 20%’ would be to get (paid) help from those affected and/or specialised teams. But both groups would be happy if the organisation booking them already knew the basics, went 80% of the way to accessibility and thus came into the project as specialists for the remaining, more difficult accessibility or UX headaches (a.k.a the 20%).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It's not worth not considering the problematic 20% or so of accessibility as the whole 100% of it and therefore call accessibility in total \"super hard\". On the other hand, it seems sensible to me to master and tackle the majority of simple basic principles in order to eliminate 80% of the barriers in your own digital interface. The 20% may exist in many cases, but should not be an obstacle to not tackling the issue out of fear, or falling for <a href=\"https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/\">snake oil services</a> that promise you the blue sky or a 100% solution of any kind.</p>\n<h2>Note</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://e-commerce-barrierefrei.de/blog/80-20-barrierefreiheit\">This article is a translation of a German-language one I posted earlier today.</a></p>",

    "title": "Best intention barriers (ARIA edition)",
    "partialText": "<p>In my experiences as an auditor (for <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG</a> and <a href=\"https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu/getting-know-european-legislation-accessibility_en\">EN 301 549</a>) I stumble over a large number of barriers. Heck, my job is to find and to help the website developer and owner to get rid of them to make their web project more inclusive and – in the truest sense of the word - accessible.</p>\n<p>But there is a certain type of barrier that are more, well, tragic than others. Instead of not being aware about the problematic approach the developer chose, they try to improve accessibility but – unbeknownst to them - create new barriers in the first place doing it. Let's talk about three types of barriers, specifically related to WAI-ARIA, created with the best intentions:</p>\n<h2>Adding aria-label as some form of accessible description</h2>\n<p>Sometimes web developers use <code>aria-label</code> to add info to an already visually labeled control. This is all well and fine, as long as the visual label is part of the programmatic name (for example, supplied by <code>aria-label</code>). WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) success criteria <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/label-in-name.html\">2.5.3</a> even specifically checks if the visual label is a substring of the programmatic accessible name.</p>\n<p>But the tragic begins when developers use <code>aria-label</code> to provide a form of accessible description. The value of this attribute may be helpful, it may even add more context and explanation to the control – but as long as the visual string is not part of the programmatic one, a new barrier is created, because <code>aria-label</code> overrides, not extends the accessible name of a control. WCAG 2.5.3 has users of voice control software in mind, and if they say \"Click <em>foo</em>\" (because it is the visual label), but <em>foo</em> is nowhere to be found, because the programmatic name of the control is <em>bar</em> – a barrier is established, albeit with a good original intention.</p>\n<p>What could help solve this situation is if <code>aria-description</code> gains more support in screen readers – because this attribute is <em>actually</em> what these well-intended developers where looking for. It does not override, but extend the output of screen readers. [Problems with the automatic translatability] of <code>aria-</code> attributes still remain, though. Therefore, it is always recommended to work with  ID references to other elements via <code>aria-labelledby</code> or <code>aria-describedby</code> (both of which are well-supported).</p>\n<h2>Adding an ARIA Role is enough, or: Adding ARIA implements functionality</h2>\n<p>For many, WAI-ARIA is considered some kind of magic fairy dust of accessibility – and often, ARIA is the first or second keyword I hear when the topic comes to inclusive web interfaces (usually <code>aria-label</code>- which leads me back to the first part of this article).</p>\n<p>So, all in all, ARIA seems to not have an awareness problem. The real issue lies in the understanding what it does and what it does <strong>not</strong> do. It is built on top of HTML, but only a syntactic extension, and therefore offers information about what an element is, what state it is in and how it is meant to be used. But what ARIA properties do not do is implement key event handlers or other functionality of this kind. Most of the time, it only announces an element as something, therefore builds up expectation e. g. about a certain form of keyboard usage. But adding for example <code>role=\"button\"</code> to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> only makes a statement and a promise, \"I'm a button now\", but does not deal with other properties of such a control. Web developers have to implement focusability and keyboard activation forms (reacting to <code>SPACE</code> and <code>ENTER</code>) themselves, for example, Alas, this is the part that is often times forgotten, leaving it as a barrier with best intentions (because the developers likely overestimated ARIA's power).</p>\n<h3>What to do instead</h3>\n<p>With very few exceptions, there are HTML elements that bring both the necessary role and all accompanying behaviour with them: Let's take the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element, which has the implicit role of <code>button</code> and relays <code>SPACE</code> and <code>ENTER</code> key presses to the click event handler. It's the easier and more convenient route to go and the reason why <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1\">the first rule of ARIA</a> is \"If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so.\"</p>\n<h2>Roles that are not what you think they are</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, an approach of \"I'm sure that what is meant with a particular semantic role\" is a bad one. Let's show some examples: </p>\n<h3>Menu</h3>\n<p>The word \"menu\" is very blurry when it comes to user interfaces, and its definition <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2020/03/stop-using-drop-down.html\">is at least as unclear as \"dropdown\"</a>. Both keywords could mean many things: navigation lists or select inputs or disclosure widgets respectively. While the colloquial definitions of \"Menu\" or \"Menubar\" each may be rather obscure, the ARIA specification is quite clear what these roles (and sub-roles like <code>menuitem</code>) are meant for. To quote <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2017/10/dont-use-aria-menu-roles-for-site-nav.html\">Adrian Roselli</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To clarify — if you are rebuilding the interface for Microsoft Word, then the File menu gets <code>role=\"menu\"</code>, lives inside a <code>role=\"menubar\"</code> container, all while File → New, File → Open, File → Save, and so on each get <code>role=\"menuitem\"</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, unless you are building the next web-based desktop-like app (think: Google Docs), better not use ARIA <code>menu</code> or <code>menubar</code> roles. Like I said in the last section - semantic roles are \"promising\" <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/menu_role#keyboard_interactions\">a certain kind of keyboard usage pattern</a>. Also, you can't put just any role in a <code>menu</code>, you are limited to <code>menuitem</code>, <code>menuitemcheckbox</code>, <code>menuitemradio</code>, <code>separator</code> and <code>group</code> roles. These two obligations combined should make you reconsider to maybe use another element:</p>\n<h4>What to do instead</h4>\n<p>Use so-called disclosure widgets. They consist of - in general - two parts: a trigger and a container. An interaction with the trigger (it makes the most sense for it to be a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>) influences the perceivability  of container – and that is about it. No keyboard behaviour is promised (the focus stays on the trigger after activation), no semantic roles are \"forbidden\" in the container. The only thing the developer has to take care of is the sequence, meaning that trigger and container should follow each other directly:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button aria-expanded=\"true|false\"&gt;\n&lt;!-- aria-expanded communicates that the construct is a disclosure widget in the first place. Thus, the true/false values have to be changed dynamically --&gt;\nNavigation\n&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- It would be the easiest option to add or remove a \"hidden\" attribute --&gt;\n...\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Banner</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, the role of <code>banner</code> seems to look like something that should be applied to page regions that are visually a banner, for example cookie banners. But its original intention is something different, als <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/banner_role\">MDN</a> states correclty:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The banner role is for defining a global site header, which usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, <code>role=\"banner\"</code> is the central header of a document.</p>\n<h4>What do do instead</h4>\n<p>I guess the intention of misleadingly choosing the <code>banner</code> role was to convey that the following block is its own area with its own content and functionality (like a cookie banner would be). The better way to communicate that is a generic landmark:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Manage Cookies\"&gt;\n...\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Listbox</h3>\n<p>I sometimes saw developers applying <code>role=\"listbox\"</code> on containers that are listing items, for example slides in a carousel. That testifies to good intentions, but, alas is wrong :</p>\n<p>A <code>listbox</code> according to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#listbox\">ARIA specification</a> is a container for interactive items, from which the user can select one from in context of data entry – think of the list of options you can choose from when you are triggering a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element. That does not quite fit into the exemplary carousel widget. It is much more sensible to use the following:</p>\n<h4>What do do instead</h4>\n<p>Simple list semantics (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) will suffice when you're <strong>not</strong> looking to re-build a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element with ARIA (or a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/\">combobox</a> for that matter).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>My advice is to handle ARIA, its roles and other properties with care. I like to compare the ARIA toolbox to a set of knives in you kitchen: Very mighty if you know what you are doing (and - in rare occasions - even necessary), but also potentially dangerous, since you can hurt maybe not yourself, but others. Just as you would not wave around with a sharp appliance (even with the best intentions), I would advise not to use WAI ARIA if you are not exactly sure what it does. And while ARIA can be hard to grasp and the specification can sometimes be cryptic, abstract and not always helpful at first glance – it's the wiser choice to leave it be, if unsure. Best intention barriers could be prevented this way.</p>\n<h2>Update May, 13th, 2024</h2>\n<p>\"ARIA doesn't implement anything\" was <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@siblingpastry@mastodon.world/112433692027271399\">too broad of a statement</a>. I changed that sentence, but keeping the notion that ARIA is most of the time not the magic (and complete!) tool many assume.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>I know, I'm late for my 2023 blog post. But somehow, stacking the usual end-of-year-stress on top of the self-made urge to write up a retrospecitive post does not really work. Also, I have my fair share of retrospectives at the end of the year traditionally, with New Year's and resolutions but also a birthday that is close to christmas and gives you \"one year older - how was the last one\" vibes. That's why it took some days into the new year to fire up my text editor and write something up.</p>\n<p>Business-wise, 2023 was a good year. I concentrated on web accessibility auditing (specifically, auditing against the harmonized <a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf\">European Standard 301 549 [PDF]</a>, which includes WCAG) and some consulting work. Stuff I did in the past, run-of-the-mill web developement was put on the back-burner purely out of timing and energy reasons. But I feel that I mustn't fall out of the loop and lose touch with current developments (just look at the pace of CSS's development alone! Awesome and frightening).</p>\n<p>I managed to do some community work with dear colleague Maja in \"reviving\" the <a href=\"https://a11y-meetup-berlin.de/\">Accessibility Meetup Berlin</a> and it is very cool to give at least a little bit back, regarding it is both an important, exciting topic and a big city that does deserve a meetup like this.</p>\n<p>The European Accessibility Act is casting its shadows, and they're getting bigger and bigger. As a consequence, I try to specialize in the not so small \"e-commerce\" part of the new and coming legizlation. So I'm creating a text-based, self-paced learning course gathering all of my knowledge on how to make an online shop accessible for quite some time now. The German version will start in 2024 and will be some kind of \"Minimum Viable Product\". If it works, I will possibly create an English-language version also, but as of now I concentrate on the first (German) version and plan to evolve this course. So, if anyone is interested, impatient and knows German, head over to <a href=\"https://e-commerce-barrierefrei.de/\">https://e-commerce-barrierefrei.de/</a> and sign up to the mailing list to be informed about the launch.</p>\n<p>Usually, I'm not that navel-gazing and self-centered, but I feel I passed a treshold which caused me to disclose something: as I said in <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@marcus/111697147089669967\">an Mastodon status message</a>, starting around now, it makes no sense to me not to be open about my chronic illness. Quote of said toot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Short, and somehow navel-gazing note on myself: It feels that there's no sense in denying anymore that I have a chronic illness, namely Multiple Sclerosis. Diagnosed 17 years ago, but getting worse and apparent only in the last 20-ish months -people who saw me \"walking\" in that time surely noticed. As of right now, walking short distances is fine but there's a point from which on I start visibly limping and a mechanical fatigue of a leg muscle enters the stage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the last year, my way of walking rapidly decreased in quality and I still have to come to terms with this (I was blessed with ~15 years of more or less standstill when it comes to this illness, so I'm privileged in more than one way) and see how I can adapt mentally and physically. All in all, I want to apologize if I behaved strangely in the last around one and a half years.</p>\n<p>This listing, work and health stuff, more or less sums the last twelve months up. I feel that I need to regain energy, adapt to the situation and maybe buy a fancy cane (any recommendations?). Here's hope that this will work in 2024!</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>Many misunderstandings prevail on the web around the topic of WAI-ARIA. Some folks are aware that only a responsible use of ARIA attributes is the way to go. The others consider the toolset ARIA provides to be a quick way to create accessibility by attribute, and according to the credo: the more the better.</p>\n<p>The latter attitude, in particular, is a dangerous one. I would like to explain why this is so in this short article. In order to better explain the danger posed by the wrong approach to ARIA, here are two short but important basics:</p>\n<h2>What ARIA is</h2>\n<p>WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a technical specification, similar to HTML and CSS, that gives us a toolbox for a dynamic web. It gives us the ability to extend HTML to communicate webapp-specific states, relationships, and properties to assistive technologies (e.g., \"expanded\", \"invalid\", or \"labeled by this one element\"). The <code>role</code> attribute can further be used to override the semantic role of an element. Sounds innocent, but it has extreme accessibility implications: for example, a <code>&lt;ul role=\"heading\"&gt;</code> is no longer an unordered list (this is the role <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> elements have \"by nature\"), but a heading.</p>\n<h2>What ARIA is not</h2>\n<p><strong>While ARIA roles themselves do not implement any functions - they only announce them to assistive technologies!</strong> Accordingly, the saying \"a role is a promise\" is central. Many people do not realize exactly this crucial point. If one - for whatever reason - converts a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to a button, the first step is usually <code>&lt;div role=\"button\"&gt;</code>, i.e. an assignment of a so-called <em>explicit</em> role.</p>\n<h2>The central misunderstanding</h2>\n<p>The tragedy here is that for many, this \"role conversion\" is also already the final step. In doing so, it announces to screen readers, for example, that this former <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is now a button (a promise is made). But now some crucial points are missing to <em>keep</em> the promise. Let's stay with the button example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Since I am now a button, you can also reach me via keyboard</em>. <strong>This is a promise that is not fulfilled by <code>&lt;div role=\"button\"&gt;</code> alone</strong>. To make the example <code>div</code> keyboard-accessible, an explicit inclusion in the tab index, e.g. via <code>tabindex=\"0\"</code> is necessary.</li>\n<li><em>Since I am a button, I can be activated by keyboard</em>. It is common for buttons to respond to the spacebar and enter key. <strong>Also this is a promise that is not fulfilled by <code>&lt;div role=\"button\"&gt;</code> alone</strong>. So you have to register a keyboard event listener in JavaScript here that responds to space and enter keys when the \"button\" is in keyboard focus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this only applies to a seemingly simple role like <code>button</code>. If you want to get an overview of exactly which usage promises you make with which semantic role, the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/\">ARIA Authoring Practices Patterns</a> should be recommended, and there especially the respective section \"Keyboard Interaction\".</p>\n<p>By the way, it is much easier to use a native HTML element than to have all this in mind. This means that you should prefer the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element to an ARIA role change wherever possible. This is because native elements not only inherently bring promises (<em>I am a button</em>), but also deliver on them at the same time (<em>I pass spacebar and enter key events to my click event handler without further ado</em>).</p>\n<p>So when accessibility experts give you advice over and over again to use classic HTML elements instead of their ARIA \"counterparts\", it has mostly to do with this central issue. It's something known as the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1\">first ARIA rule</a>. Rebuilding a native element using only ARIA means is possible, but complicated, because you have to think of everything the element is able and promises to do (and implement exactly that manually yourself). So if you have a choice and can rely on native HTML elements. The famous \"developer experience\" and accessibility go hand in hand here, because in the end, why reinventing the wheel when a shop is nearby?</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are – by design – an abstract resource. While they try to cover all things  accessibility in the web (and by extension and update, in the digital world) it is a tough resource to wrap your head around. Luckily, there have been projects and teachers that try to help with the understanding of that important but often times legalese document. Among them are great resources like <a href=\"https://TestingAccessibility.com\">Marcy Sutton-Todd's TestingAccessibility.com</a>, <a href=\"https://Practical-Accessibility.today\">Sara Soudeidan's Practical-Accessibility.today</a> and the great content from <a href=\"https://A11y-Collective.com\">A11y-Collective.com</a>, just to name a few (Note: all of the pages mentioned are paid products, but worth the money in my opinion). But W3C's WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) provides a bunch of helping <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Non-normative\">non-normative</a> resources to get a grasp on WCAG. The \"Quick Reference\" is such a useful helper, especially if you consider the fact that it is presenting WCAG's techniques in a quick, in-context way. And of course, there are \"Tags\" (in the \"Filter\" tab) to approach the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines from more human-digestible keywords such as \"carousels\", \"modals\" and \"zoom\".</p>\n<p>A resource that deserves also a little more time in the limelight is \"Using ARIA\" (<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/\">find the current, 2018 version here</a> and the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/using-aria/\">latest Editor's Draft from 2021 over there</a>). Like the document's title possibly already spoils, it is an informational documentation to use WAI-ARIA in practice. Since applying ARIA with only half-knowledge is considered dangerous, because it can create new barriers in the first place, a document like this is needed and well appreciated. If you haven't heard of \"Using ARIA\" as a document before, you might have heard of the \"Five Rules of ARIA\". That's the place where they originate from and a place where you can study them.</p>\n<p>But enough with the introduction: In this blog post, I will try to explain one section of \"Using ARIA\" even further, namely <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#methods-to-provide-context-sensitive-name-description-text\">the one that centers around providing context sensitive error messages in forms and using ARIA to associate error message and faulty field</a>.</p>\n<p>The situation is as follows: if a field is considered faulty or in an error state, it should be semantically marked up as such by adding the attribute <code>aria-invalid=\"true\"</code> to the field. In parallel, it would be most useful and actually <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/error-suggestion.html\">required by WCAG Success Criterion 3.3.3 to provide a helpful error message </a> on how to resolve the error. Since <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-errormessage\"><code>aria-errormessage</code></a> is <a href=\"https://a11ysupport.io/tech/aria/aria-errormessage_attribute\">not considered accessibility-supported enough</a> yet to provide the message, the current best practice is to use <code>aria-describedby</code> for that. Without further context, this attribute is used to supply the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.2/#mapping_additional_nd\">accessible description</a> to an element. But in the context of error messages and especially in pair with <code>aria-invalid=\"true\"</code> it is used to point to the ID of the error message, making screen readers read it out loud, after they encounter the field and announce its error state.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"POST\" name=\"example\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fields marked with \"*\" are mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;E-Mail*: &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"email\" aria-describedby=\"emailMissing\" aria-required=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;p id=\"emailMissing\" hidden&gt;The e-mail address is needed, please supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;button type=\"sumbit\"&gt; Send &lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The aforementioned attributes must only exist in the error state at all and in combination. The respective section of \"Using ARIA\" mentions three possibilities on how to do that:</p>\n<p>If you want to associate context sensitive text, such as an error message, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the referenced element to the DOM when the error state occurs.</li>\n<li>Add the error text as child of the referenced element in the DOM when the error state occurs.</li>\n<li>Add the <code>id</code> reference in the DOM to the <code>aria-labelledby</code>/<code>aria-describedby</code> attribute, when the error state occurs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the following, I will try to explain each of the quoted options in detail and with code examples. For creating the error state, I'm using a simple \"data not supplied, field empty\" situation, regardless of browser capabilities (and their advantages or disadvantages).</p>\n<h2>Adding the whole error message only in error state</h2>\n<p>In this case – as far as I understand – the error message is injected in the case the system detects something is wrong. Up until that point, a reference to an accessible description exists, but is invalid. The consequence is that the field is not programmatically considered faulty. Note that I both add the \"reference target\" in form of the actual error paragraph to the document, and also add <code>aria-invalid=\"true\"</code> in the error state to the empty input field as well to be very clear about it.</p>\n<p>Before (non-error state):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"POST\" name=\"example\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fields marked with \"*\" are mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;E-Mail*: &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"email\" aria-describedby=\"emailMissing\" aria-required=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>After (in error state):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"POST\" name=\"example\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fields marked with \"*\" are mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;E-Mail*: &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"email\" aria-describedby=\"emailMissing\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;p id=\"emailMissing\" hidden&gt;The e-mail address is needed, please supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt; Send &lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/marcus/pen/mdQazwP/6224c974400498b3cc56af68056e6d40?editors=1010\">You can find a working example with the necessary (and commented) JavaScript in this CodePen.</a></p>\n<h2>Preparing the error state container, but adding its text content  only in error state</h2>\n<p>In this scenario, the reference between field and accessible description is valid, but because the referenced element has no text content, the accessible description of the field is void.</p>\n<p>Once again, I'm using <code>aria-invalid=\"true\"</code> for marking up the error state explicitly. If you look into the working CodePen below, you will also find that I am removing the <code>hidden</code> attribute and change the text content of the prepared error container.</p>\n<p>Before (non-error state):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"POST\" name=\"example\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fields marked with \"*\" are mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;E-Mail*: &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"email\" aria-describedby=\"emailMissing\" aria-required=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;p id=\"emailMissing\" hidden&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>After (in error state):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"POST\" name=\"example\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fields marked with \"*\" are mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;E-Mail*: &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"email\" aria-describedby=\"emailMissing\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;p id=\"emailMissing\"&gt;The e-mail address is needed, please supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/marcus/pen/Jjewmmj/9685f3a08a1ad446c6a62d1660874ec0?editors=1010\">You can find a working example with the necessary (and commented) JavaScript in this CodePen.</a></p>\n<h2>Prepare everything, but build the programmatic association once error state occurs</h2>\n<p>Here, we are preparing the error message and an easy way to build the reference by using an \"unsemantic\" <code>data-aria-describedby</code> attribute as a source for the  real one. When the form is in its error state, the value of our helper is programmatically detected and \"put\" in the real <code>aria-describedby</code>. This creates the proper reference.</p>\n<p>Update 18/8/2023: I got feedback that this is considered the best of the three options. And also that I wrote <code>type=\"sumbit\"</code> everywhere in the submission button HTML. Sorry and thanks, Birkir!</p>\n<p>Before (non-error state):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"POST\" name=\"example\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fields marked with \"*\" are mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;E-Mail*: &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"email\" data-aria-describedby=\"emailMissing\" aria-required=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;p id=\"emailMissing\" hidden&gt;The e-mail address is needed, please supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>After (in error state):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;form method=\"POST\" name=\"example\"&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Fields marked with \"*\" are mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;label for=\"email\"&gt;E-Mail*: &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=\"email\" data-aria-describedby=\"emailMissing\" aria-describedby=\"emailMissing\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"true\" /&gt;\n\n  &lt;p id=\"emailMissing\"&gt;The e-mail address is needed, please supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/marcus/pen/NWEeOJY/39fd67835dd205c350ae4995d9588b75?editors=1010\">You can find a working example with the necessary (and commented) JavaScript in this CodePen.</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I hope I understood everything right and provided an explanatory extension of the paragraph in question.

    "partialText": "<p>With the rise of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_marcusherrmann/status/1588548427373506560\">Toxic Muskulinity</a> on Twitter, Mastodon - or the Fediverse respectively - is talk of the town. And for the largest part – rightly so! It seems that parts of the IndieWeb finally get at least their 15 minutes of fame. Of course, the hopes are high that this momentum becomes a sustainable one.</p>\n<p>The situation, nonetheless, forces many of us from a platform that was a virtual home (or at least a considerable part of our social media usage). Without spreading platitudes, this could lead to new starts in a new environment, that has both less and more features than the so-called \"birdsite\".</p>\n<p>One of the features that Mastodon has, but Twitter doesn't is to explicitly set the Tweet/Toot (<a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@andy@bell.bz/109387454265690719\">Twoot?</a>) language. The only obvious advantage for that is at first glance, that in a multi-language timeline full of status updates with explicitly set language, screen readers can read, erm, twoots in the language their respective authors intended. And - while Twitter's autodetection heuristics of the tweet language seems (or seemed?) to be mostly capable of recognizing the language - that is an advantage of its own.</p>\n<p>But this feature really shines with the <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases\">4.0.X release of the Mastodon core software</a>, because it enables users to follow other users <em>but in only selected languages</em>. It may be only me – but that should prevent people that toot in different languages the \"need\" to set up different accounts (a thing that I did on Twitter to, let's say, keep motorsports, local politics and - for the most part - TV shows and music out of my \"main account\").</p>\n<p>Now, the solution of course isn't perfect - language alone does not automatically equal \"region\" or local context. But still, it is a start to me, to <s>tweet</s> toot more and more spontaneous, like I did before. Because I'm, for the most part, really enjoying the \"early Twitter\" feel of the \"Mammoth site\".</p>\n<p>So, tldr: For the foreseeable future I will likely more post more \"local accessibility stuff\", so for example some things related to the German WCAG/<abbr title=\"European Norm\">EN</abbr> 301549 test collective \"BIK BITV Test\", since it is right now a large part of my everyday work. But I will set the toot language to \"German\", so international followers can filter these out, per:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visiting a profile</li>\n<li>Clicking the overflow menu with the three dots (programmatic name is \"Menu\")</li>\n<li>Select \"Change subscribed languages\"</li>\n<li>Pick the languages via checking checkboxes in the modal that appears</li>\n<li>Click \"save changes\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And I would really like to see mobile and native apps, <a href=\"https://github.com/nolanlawson/pinafore\">other great web interfaces</a> to catch up. But the good thing about this environment is: We can - at least, partly - contribute, and are not dependable on the irratic whims of a rich child king.</p>\n<details style=\"margin-top: 1.5em\">\n<summary>Meta, blog-related</summary>\n\"Only one blog post a year\" was definitely not my publishing goal for 2022. I actually got plans, designs, and a feature branch with the new version of marcus.io – but I haven't found the time to advance and blog this year due to various reasons. Because I don't want to make New Year's resolutions at all (especially not a month early): Let's just say that I hope the article frequency changes in 2023 for the better.\n</details>",

    "title": "Farewell, 2021",
    "partialText": "<p>No big or structured retrospective post for me this year, I'm afraid. Not because only bad stuff happened – it is suffice to say, it was an overall mixed bag. There <em>was</em> a fare share of good things, but first and foremost I'm feeling very tired and not in a overly retrospective mood. Thus, in a following, you'll find a more or less stream-of-conciousness list of what I considered a highlight in 2021:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Around spring time, I was finally able to release my ebook <strong><a href=\"https://accessible-vue.com/\">&quot;Accessible Vue&quot;</a></strong> – and then even failed to mention it in this very blog. Nevertheless, I'm more or less proud of it. Structuring, writing and editing it was an exhausting but overall great experience. While I initially offered it as a paid product, keeping it this way was never my intention. \"JS framework land\" really needs accessibility awareness and how-to's. So yesterday I was finally able to complete Accessible Vue's \"lifecycle\" by offering it free of charge (you can still pay what you want, mind you) and, much more importantly, offer an HTML version. You can find the whole book at <a href=\"https://accessible-vue.com/read\">accessible-vue.com/read</a>. The text is now available under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0</a>. Enjoy reading!</li>\n<li>The publication of Accessible Vue also led to my first-ever <strong>conference talk</strong>, at <a href=\"https://knowbility.org/programs/accessu-2021\">Knowability&#039;s Access U 2021</a>. While this was a very interesting and enriching experience and while I enjoy teaching, my anxiety and \"stage fright\" levels around it weren't pretty – and I'm fairly sure the participants of my workshop noticed, big time.</li>\n<li>I think I wrote in the past year wrap-up posts something about once being able to write for <strong>Smashing Magazine</strong>. Well, 2021 was the year it happened! And it happened also in the AccessibleVueniverse, so to speak: <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/three-insights-vuejs-accessibility/\">&quot;Three Insights I Gained While Researching Vue.js Accessibility&quot;</a>. Thank you, Vitaly, for not only giving me the chance to write for your <s>amazing</s> smashing publication, but also for actively inviting me to!</li>\n<li>If I look back on my freelance business I notice that I barely touched any code, but did instead a whole lot of <strong>training and consulting</strong> jobs with great customers. I dove way deeper in the conformance and regulation side of accessibility than in the years before (especially when it comes to German legislation), and would say that at least three thirds of everything I did was speaking, teaching or writing audits or documentation instead of code. A very exciting and pleasant development. And for 2022, some very interesting clients and developments are already in the pipeline.</li>\n<li>In last year's <a href=\"https://marcus.io/blog/my-2020\">&quot;My 2020&quot;</a> retrospective, I highlighted the profound impact the book \"How to take smart notes\" from Sönke Ahrens had on me, my way of note taking. And for 2021 this impact only got bigger and bigger, given that I considered myself more of a consultant than a developer this year. And as a knowledge worker of this kind, a working note-taking system is crucial. I guess I found just that in both the Zettelkasten \"mindset\" and in the (free and multi-platform) software <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\"><strong>Obsidian</strong></a>. I have the strong feeling to write more about that in the near future, so please <s>like and</s> <a href=\"https://marcus.io/feed\">subscribe</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This ends my un-edited ramblings about 2021.

    "title": "What's on the menu?",
    "partialText": "<p>What is on your mind if I just write the word \"menu\" without giving further context? I bet that either you are not sure what exactly it is referring to (because it is an umbrella term), or you come to a definition of the word that differs from the next person. <strong>Note: The following is a slightly edited excerpt of chapter 4 of \"Accessible Vue\".</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that is one of the main issues when dealing with \"menus\" in accessibility. \"Menu\" alone is not enough, and in order to be more precise and to not confuse different things, especially in the web app context, we have to establish two much more pronounced terms. After this distinction is made, I will present ways to build the one or the other in Vue.</p>\n<h2>Navigation menus</h2>\n<p>The first question one has to ask is, \"What purpose does the component have?\". Is it a list of items that - upon interaction - leads to another page, route or file, respectively? See how I described the word \"link\"? Do these items lead to web app states that can be reached under their own URLs? If so, you are likely building a navigation menu.</p>\n<p>In the wild, navigation menus are often found in mobile or narrow screen contexts where a part of the navigation collapses into \"a menu\" either completely, or only part of it does.</p>\n<p>Maybe you read <a href=\"https://marcus.io/blog/disclosure-widget-vuejs\">about the concept of a disclosure widget in an earlier blogpost of mine</a>, and this is actually the best choice for a navigation menu (Quick aside: <a href=\"https://avue.link/menuornot\">I learned this with a detour, hat tip Heydon Pickering. Simple solutions are most of the time the best ones</a>).</p>\n<p>Let's imagine you have an e-commerce app which has an account button. Your designer's concept is that, once the button is clicked, a container with two links appears. The first item being \"Past Orders\" (and it leads to a route where your past orders are listed), the second one being \"My Address\", which leads to a route (or page) where you can change your postal address(es) for delivery. Probably you would build such a component like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JS\">&lt;template&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;button\n            @click=\"toggleOpen\"\n            :aria-expanded=\"!open.toString()\"&gt;My Account&lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;div :hidden=\"open\"&gt;\n            &lt;ul&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Past Orders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;My Address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\nexport default {\n    data() {\n        return {\n            open: false\n        }\n    },\n    methods: {\n        toggleOpen() {\n            this.open = !this.open;\n        }\n    }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You may recognize the pillars of the disclosure widget. Since it is a central widget pattern for accessibility, let's reiterate its important parts here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I chose a button as the triggering element. Thus, the <code>@click</code> event listener also listens to <code>SPACE</code> and <code>ENTER</code> key events. This comes for free because when using the <code>&lt;button /&gt;</code> element.</li>\n<li>I made sure the disclosed content comes right after the button in the DOM.</li>\n<li>The disclosed content has the <code>hidden</code> attribute on its container (therefore is hidden to all users). The value of <code>hidden</code> attribute is made reactive. Initially, it is set to the opposite of <code>open</code> (<code>!open</code>). Also, the button indicates that interaction with it influences the perceptibility of another element. Unlike the reactive <code>hidden</code>, I made sure the boolean that is the value of <code>aria-expanded</code> is cast into a string. Otherwise, Vue wouldn't render the attribute altogether when it's <em>falsey</em>. Alas, in this case, users of assistive technology would not notice that this button has a disclosure-toggling function. So the <code>aria-expanded</code> attribute has to stay present under all circumstances.</li>\n<li>As you can see from the slim <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block, no focus management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that navigation menus should be the most common form of menus, it totally makes sense to put the \"disclosure widget\" parts into a component and let other components use instances of it.</p>\n<p>Find working \"navigation \"CodeSandBoxes for <a href=\"https://avue.link/v2navmenu\">Vue 2 here</a> and <a href=\"https://avue.link/v3navmenu\">Vue 3 here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Action Menus</h2>\n<p>Most of the menus you are about to build in your apps will come down to navigation menus (and, therefore, to disclosure widgets).</p>\n<p>Some menus of your web app are meant to behave like the menus of your machine's operating system. When you click a menu item, something should happen (for example, your printer should start to do its job). In web development (and semantics), we got the general distinction of interactive elements that \"lead to places\" (links) and ones that \"change state\", or, sloppily put, \"do something\" (buttons). So, if a menu exclusively consists of actionable items, and you are aware that you a) will need to implement <a href=\"https://avue.link/actionmenukeyboard\">a special keyboard pattern</a> and b) will send most screen readers into a special \"app mode\" – only then use the action menu concept.</p>\n<p>However, even then you have to buckle up for a much more complex pattern. If I would describe it in detail here, making the subsection about action menus way longer than the one with the easy and rather short pattern of navigation menu – and then I would be doing accessibility a disservice. A complex pattern leads to more explanations and code examples, which leads to more text. This itself could lead to \"perceived importance\" of this pattern, which I'd like to avoid (because a disclosure widget is a right choice for 99% of your menu needs).</p>\n<p>I try to solve this dilemma by pointing you to two resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://avue.link/actionmenuap\">The official authoring practice on action menus</a>. The practice itself is not really disputed among experts (that's why I point to it), but it's actually the naming and tutorials around it. In the practice's description, you can and should learn about what WAI-ARIA structures and especially what keyboard behaviour is needed.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://avue.link/actionmenu\">A Vue implementation of this pattern on CodeSandBox with inline comments</a>. It is quite complex and, franky, only worth visiting when you came to the decision that you <em>really</em> need an action menu built in Vue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To conclude: When you look into the linked Vue implementation, you'll learn that an action menu (according to the Authoring Pattern) is a complex beast, and most of the time, not worth the hassle.</p>\n<p>Oh, and one thing about the ARIA roles of <code>menu</code> and <code>menuitem</code> you'll find in the implementation: These roles are intended for action menus only and should not be used for navigation. \"Menu item\" is here synonymous with \"action menu item\". Like I said, the situation around the term menu is broken beyond repair.</p>\n<h2>The takeaway</h2>\n<p>Finally, if you only remember two things of this section, make it these:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If in doubt, use the disclosure widget pattern (as described in chapter 2, and above).</li>\n<li>Use <code>role=\"menu\"</code> and <code>role=\"menuitem\"</code> sparingly and not for navigation purposes.</li>\n</ol>",
