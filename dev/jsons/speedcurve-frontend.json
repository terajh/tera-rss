    "title": "How fast is fast enough? Rethinking web performance in pragmagical terms",
    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"large-para\"&gt;In a world full of friction &amp;#8211; slow lines, dropped calls, canceled flights &amp;#8211; creating moments of digital flow can feel like a gift.&amp;#160;\"Fast enough\" isn&amp;#8217;t just about protecting conversion rates. It&amp;#8217;s about creating experiences that preserve momentum, reduce friction, and feel almost invisible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/hero-unicorn.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to web performance, how fast is fast enough?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a question I&amp;#8217;ve tried to answer in different ways over the years. But while preparing &lt;a href=\"https://conffab.com/presentation/how-fast-is-fast-enough/?gl=x9afm7Z3U7ou\"&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"https://perfnow.nl/\"&gt;performance.now()&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to go back to first principles. I tried to look at the question with fresh eyes &amp;#8211; to set aside the patterns I&amp;#8217;ve accumulated after years of working in the performance space and ask myself: what does \"fast\" really mean?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The honest answer? It depends.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;There are so many variables. Any attempt to reduce \"fast enough\" to a single number &amp;#8211; 1.2 seconds, 2.5 seconds, 100 milliseconds &amp;#8211; quickly falls apart. If you came here hoping for a universal threshold, I&amp;#8217;m sorry to disappoint you.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to explore something more nuanced: what fast &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like and how we might bridge the gap between business pragmatism and user delight.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Because somewhere between those two lies what I like to call the \"pragmagical\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fast is magical&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.catherinejue.com/fast\"&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Catherine Jue has captured my imagination.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;She describes how apps like Raycast or Superhuman serve content in under 100 milliseconds, often before you even consciously expect it to appear. The result isn&amp;#8217;t that users say, \"Wow, this is fast.\" Instead, they say things like \"This is amazing\" and \"This is delightful\" and \"I love this tool\".&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Speed at that level doesn&amp;#8217;t register as a metric. It registers as magic.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Fast eliminates cognitive friction. There's no waiting, no hesitation, no tiny mental tax while your brain holds context in suspense. The experience flows. It feels effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s fascinating: users don&amp;#8217;t praise these products for being fast. They praise them for being great. &lt;strong&gt;Fast is invisible, and that invisibility makes it powerful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;That idea pushed me to rethink our industry&amp;#8217;s current mindset. Have we, in focusing on &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/get-started-with-core-web-vitals/\"&gt;Core Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt; thresholds and &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/site-speed-business-correlation/\"&gt;business ROI&lt;/a&gt;, accidentally lowered our ambitions? And in doing so, are we hurting our users?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Fast is pragmatic&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If web performance weren't pragmatic, most of us wouldn't have jobs. But let's think bigger than that.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;In performance conversations, we often frame speed in terms of &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/site-speed-business-correlation/\"&gt;business impact&lt;/a&gt;: make your site fast enough to improve conversion rate, reduce bounce rate, increase time on site, or boost revenue. &lt;strong&gt;If faster pages don&amp;#8217;t produce measurable ROI beyond a certain point, is there any reason to continue optimizing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit, I&amp;#8217;ve made versions of this argument myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If business metrics flatten out into what we call the &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-plateau/\"&gt;performance plateau&lt;/a&gt;, maybe that&amp;#8217;s \"fast enough\". Maybe we should stop there.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;But something about that feels incomplete. It frames speed purely as a lever for business gain, not as an intrinsic component of user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/practical-magical-1.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;So I started thinking... what if we didn&amp;#8217;t have to choose between pragmatism and magic? What if we aimed for something that blends both?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s where the idea of \"pragmagical\" performance goals comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/practical-magical-2.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Who are you trying to please?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Before you define \"fast enough\", it&amp;#8217;s worth asking a foundational question: who are you trying to please?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Your boss?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Google?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Your users?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The order of that list is intentional. &lt;strong&gt;In many organizations, users have become an afterthought.&lt;/strong&gt; We optimize for revenue and SEO scores before we ask how the experience actually feels.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s start with the business side.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably heard some version of this: &lt;em&gt;\"Our brand is strong. Our products are amazing. People will tolerate a bit of slowness.\"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/too-cool.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a comforting belief. But is it true? Luckily, it&amp;#8217;s testable...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;What happens when you slow things down?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I worked at a company that had a customer that was a very cool brand. They weren&amp;#8217;t entirely convinced that performance mattered, so we ran an 18-week multivariate test.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;For two cohorts of users, we artificially throttled the experience by 500 and 1000 milliseconds &amp;#8211; not to the point of being unusable, just noticeably slower. The other cohort received the normal, faster experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The results were predictable in one sense: the slower cohorts converted less.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;But what surprised us came later.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;After 12 weeks, we stopped throttling and continued to monitor all three groups for six more weeks. &lt;strong&gt;The users who had the slower experiences returned at lower rates, even after performance returned to normal.&lt;/strong&gt; The slightly degraded experience had a lingering effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/ab-test.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Speed doesn&amp;#8217;t just affect immediate conversions. It shapes memory, trust, and return behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Finding your performance plateau&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#8217;t run your own throttling experiments, &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/features/performance-monitoring/\"&gt;real user monitoring&lt;/a&gt; (RUM) can provide similar insights. By correlating performance metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) with business metrics such as conversion rate, patterns often emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, on one site I looked at, the peak conversion rate (6.2%) aligned with an LCP of about 1.1 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/correlation-1.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I also identified the performance plateau for this site. In this case, conversions flattened out beyond 2.8 seconds. Improving from 4.5 to 2.9 seconds made little difference. Pushing users toward that 1.1 second experience did.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/correlation-2.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Two key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;There is no universal \"ideal\" number.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Your thresholds are unique to your site and audience.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you stay on the plateau, business metrics stagnate. If you want meaningful gains, you may need to go much faster, not just incrementally faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Google's thresholds are not your thresholds (and that's okay)&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We need to talk about Google.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Google's &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/get-started-with-core-web-vitals/\"&gt;Core Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt; have helped simplify performance conversations &amp;#8211; making the topic accessible to more people &amp;#8211; which is awesome. &lt;strong&gt;But the downside is that people focus on Google's thresholds rather than investigating their own user data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Core Web Vitals focus on three key user experience dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) &amp;#8211; Is meaningful content visible?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) &amp;#8211; Does the page feel stable?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Interaction to Next Paint (INP) &amp;#8211; Is the page responsive to user actions?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/core-web-vitals-new.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Google provides \"good\", \"needs improvement\", and \"poor\" thresholds based on aggregated data. These are extremely useful as starting points. But they are not your finish line.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s thresholds are built on broad datasets, not YOUR dataset. Your audience, your industry, and your user expectations may demand something stricter.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you aim for a 2.5-second LCP simply because Google says it&amp;#8217;s \"good\", you may be leaving opportunity on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;The danger of averaging away reality&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://contentsquare.com/blog/interaction-to-next-paint/\"&gt;A recent study by Contentsquare&lt;/a&gt; looked at 997 retail sites (yes, it bothers me that it's not 1,000). They found that customers with \"good\" INP experienced a 2.5% conversion rate, compared to 2% for those with \"poor\" INP. That 0.5% difference represents a 25% lift, which is a lot!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/contentsquare.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;But remember: that finding is based on aggregated data.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;When my colleague Cliff Crocker &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/INP-user-experience-correlation/\"&gt;analyzed four individual sites&lt;/a&gt;, he found that peak conversion rates occurred at INP thresholds ranging from 50 to 150 milliseconds &amp;#8211; all significantly below Google&amp;#8217;s 200-millisecond \"good\" benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/inp-correlation.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;For those sites, 200 milliseconds wasn&amp;#8217;t good enough. It was potentially leaving revenue behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aiming for someone else&amp;#8217;s target is almost always a mistake.&lt;/strong&gt; Find your own.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Metrics &amp;#8800; feelings&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s talk about users.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all seen surveys claiming users expect pages to load in two seconds. Or three. Or five. Or eight.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;People have no shortage of opinions. &lt;strong&gt;But what users say they want doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily correlate with how they behave.&lt;/strong&gt; And metrics don&amp;#8217;t directly translate to feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We try to map numbers to experience &amp;#8211; as we should &amp;#8211; but we need to acknowledge that this mapping is imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Analytics can be misleading&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;A user spending a long time on your site might be deeply engaged. Or completely lost. Without usability testing, you can't know which is which.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics like Time on Site and Pages per Session can hide frustration.&lt;/strong&gt; Pairing usability research with performance analytics gives you a much richer understanding of what&amp;#8217;s actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Engagement vs. productivity tasks&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It also helps to consider why users are on your site. Broadly speaking, tasks fall into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Engagement tasks are open-ended and absorbing&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Users are browsing, exploring, dreaming. They have a high tolerance for waiting because time isn't tightly constrained.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Think about researching a vacation. You&amp;#8217;re scrolling through destinations, reading reviews, looking at photos, dreaming dreams like this guy below. Waiting a few extra moments for content to load might not bother you much.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/vacation-dream.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Productivity tasks are goal-oriented and time-sensitive&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Users want to complete a specific action quickly. They might be in a rush or otherwise stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Continuing the example I started above... imagine you&amp;#8217;re on that vacation and you've just found out that your return flight has been canceled. You urgently need to rebook, extend your hotel stay, or find alternative accommodations... all while using your phone out on the hotel balcony trying to find a good signal, like this poor guy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/vacation-reality.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, your tolerance for waiting disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same user. Same website. Completely different emotional state.&lt;/strong&gt; Metrics alone won&amp;#8217;t capture that shift.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;One slow step breaks the journey&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if most of your user journey is fast, one slow step can poison the entire experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;When users move through a journey &amp;#8211; searching, filtering, adding to cart, checking out &amp;#8211; they build momentum. &lt;strong&gt;A single sluggish interaction can shatter that momentum and make everything feel slower than it actually is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s why focusing only on page-level metrics is insufficient. You need to consider task-level performance and entire user journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Designing for flow&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the concept of flow state.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Flow is when someone is so immersed in an activity that nothing else seems to matter. The experience feels effortless and absorbing.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;In digital experiences, true flow is hard to achieve. Networks have latency. Devices have limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what we&amp;#8217;re really trying to do is fake flow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;One hundred milliseconds is often cited as the threshold for \"instantaneous\". The idea was rooted in human perception. Interactions below that threshold feel immediate because the human eye takes roughly 100 milliseconds to process visual information.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/100ms-quote.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012, 100 milliseconds was our north star for user-perceived performance. Have we lost sight of it?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking &lt;em&gt;\"How fast do we need to be to avoid hurting conversion or bounce rate?\"&lt;/em&gt; maybe we should ask, &lt;em&gt;\"How fast do we need to be to feel instantaneous?\"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Closing the gap between pragmatic and magical&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Pragmatic speed is about:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Meeting business targets&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitoring regressions&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimizing ROI&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Magical speed is about:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Eliminating cognitive friction&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Approaching instantaneous interactions&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Creating delight&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Pragmagical speed lives at the intersection. It acknowledges business realities while still striving for experiences that feel seamless and joyful.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/practical-magical-3.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We may not always reach 100 milliseconds. But aiming higher changes the conversation. It pushes us beyond \"good enough\". &lt;strong&gt;It reminds us that we are in the business of creating experiences for other humans.&lt;/strong&gt; And it reminds us to invite empathy into our processes.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re trying to define \"fast enough\" for your site, I hope you keep these principles in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no universal \"fast enough\".&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;Your optimal thresholds are unique to your audience and business model.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benchmarks are a baseline, not a ceiling.&lt;/strong&gt; Meeting recommended standards doesn&amp;#8217;t guarantee optimal performance.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed affects long-term trust.&lt;/strong&gt; Even small degradations can influence return behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics don&amp;#8217;t equal feelings.&lt;/strong&gt; Pair performance data with usability research to understand real user experience.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context matters.&lt;/strong&gt; Engagement tasks and productivity tasks have different tolerance for delay.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journey-level performance is critical.&lt;/strong&gt; One slow interaction can break momentum across an entire flow.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim beyond tolerable.&lt;/strong&gt; Strive for experiences that feel smooth, effortless, and intuitive &amp;#8211; not just acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;\"Fast enough\" isn&amp;#8217;t just about protecting conversion rates. It&amp;#8217;s about creating experiences that preserve momentum, reduce friction, and feel almost invisible. And when performance becomes invisible, that&amp;#8217;s when it starts to feel exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/signup/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog-trials\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/447/customer-logos-free-trial-banner.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

What some folks may not know is that &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/last-painted-hero/\"&gt;LCP had its genesis way back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, when Mark Zeman and Steve Souders (our chief SpeedCurvers) came up with the idea of a web performance metric that better represented a user's visual experience. They used JavaScript to find the largest element on the page, saved that rectangle to JSON, and then scanned through the video frames of a page loading to work out when that element was visible to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;This spawned a family of Hero Rendering metrics: Largest Image Render, Largest Background Image, Largest Text, First Painted Hero, and Last Painted Hero.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;This then inspired Paul Irish on the Chrome team to add Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which uses the same principles to calculate the paint time of an element. From its launch, LCP has became one of the most important Core Web Vital metrics used today by anyone curious about web performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;But the missing piece of the puzzle was that LCP originally was only supported in Chrome. &lt;a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/LargestContentfulPaint\"&gt;Firefox added LCP support&lt;/a&gt; last year, and most recently the &lt;a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/apple-safari-update-enables-tracking-two-core-web-vitals-metrics/563465/\"&gt;Safari team has brought LCP (as well as Interaction to Next Paint) to Webkit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/lcp-safari-3.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for folks who care about web performance? You can finally get visibility into the breadth of your users' experiences.

This dashboard has quickly become on of my favourites (and given how much I love all our dashboards, that's saying a lot!).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/new-vitals-dashboard.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Your Vitals dashboard gives you:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;A quick snapshot of how your entire site performs across Google's Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, and CLS) as well as other important metrics, like Backend Time, First Contentful Paint, and Total Blocking Duration&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Spot issues faster with heatmaps that can be filtered by page, browser, location, and device type&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Quickly drill down into performance hot spots and get deeper session- and page-level diagnostics, including subparts for INP and LCP&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;See warnings when data samples are too small to be meaningful, so you can focus on real issues, not red herrings&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read: &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/get-started-with-core-web-vitals/\"&gt;Get Started with Core Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;User Happiness update&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We pioneered User Happiness six years ago, when a number of our customers asked us if there was a RUM equivalent to the synthetic Lighthouse score. In other words, what they wanted was a single *non-technical* UX metric that everyone in their company could rally around.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, our own Steve Souders developed an algorithm that took into account a number of key user-focused metrics, and the User Happiness metric was born.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Six years later, User Happiness was in need of a refresh, to reflect new metrics (including changes to Core Web Vitals) and browser evolution. SpeedCurve engineer extraordinaire Joseph Wynn led this project, and earlier this month we were excited to &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/user-happiness/\"&gt;announce our new User Happiness metric&lt;/a&gt; to the world!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/user-happiness.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Benefits of tracking User Happiness:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Easy to see how many of your page views at any given time are happy, okay, or unhappy&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Easier to communicate about performance with non-technical stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Set up performance budgets and alerts, so you know if more of your users are suddenly unhappy&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;See how User Happiness changes over time&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Drill down into underlying causes of user unhappiness (so you can fix them!)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Heat maps in your Favorites&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most-requested features we've ever had, and we were so excited to deliver! We added the ability to create heat maps to your Favorites (custom) dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/heat-maps.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Heat maps are a powerful way to get an instant overview of where performance issues are hiding across your site. They let you break down your performance metrics (including custom metrics) by different dimensions &amp;#8212; including page label, browser, location, and device type &amp;#8212; so you can easily spot anomalies and patterns in your web performance data.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Easier RUM for your Shopify store&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We have our friend &lt;a href=\"https://sia.codes/\"&gt;Sia Karamalegos&lt;/a&gt; to thank for this awesome integration. If you have a Shopify storefront and you're already using SpeedCurve Synthetic, now you can &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/how-to-use-speedcurve-in-shopify/\"&gt;add SpeedCurve RUM to your Shopify store in minutes&lt;/a&gt;, right from the Shopify App Store. No coding or theme editing required!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/correlation-chart.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;With RUM, you can do things like:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitor &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/get-started-with-core-web-vitals/\"&gt;Core Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Measure the impact of slow pages on your business (such as the &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/create-correlation-charts\"&gt;correlation chart&lt;/a&gt; pictured above, which shows how conversion rate gets worse as pages get slower)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/investigate-rum-sessions\"&gt;Investigate RUM sessions&lt;/a&gt; to find anomalies&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Fight regressions with &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/complete-guide-performance-budgets/\"&gt;performance budgets and alerts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Easier RUM for your Magento project, too!&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;There are few things more flattering than having our users build apps that empower other folks to use our tools. The credit for building this much-appreciated module goes to Jesper Ingels and the rest of the team at &lt;a href=\"https://www.bluebirdday.nl/\"&gt;Bluebird Day&lt;/a&gt;. With their &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/real-user-monitoring-magento/\"&gt;SpeedCurve RUM module for Magento&lt;/a&gt;, you can integrate real user monitoring into your Magento project in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/magento2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;With this module, you can:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Enter your SpeedCurve RUM ID (available on your Settings page) and the RUM script loads automatically on your pages&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Configure all settings via the Magento Admin Panel, including RUM ID, page labels, and cookie consent handling&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage page labels for product and category pages&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Insert the RUM script only after the visitor accepts cookies (privacy-proof!)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Immediately start tracking Core Web Vitals and other critical RUM metrics&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Measure the impact of page slowdowns on your business&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Fight regressions with performance budgets and alerts&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Get detailed recommendations for fixing performance issues&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Monitor LoAFs and get to the bottom of JS issues&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;With Long Animation Frames (LoAFs), we finally have a way to understand the impact of code on the user experience. Earlier this year, we added the ability to&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/long-animation-frames-support/\"&gt;monitor Long Animation Frames&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and get diagnostics to fix the third parties and other scripts that are hurting your page speed and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/guide-loafs.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the complexity that comes with measuring script-related performance in the field, our LoAF monitoring is straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;New metrics, including Total Blocking Duration, available throughout your dashboards&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Helpful new data visualizations in three of your dashboards&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Extremely valuable new visualization in your RUM waterfall&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read:&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/guide-long-animation-frames-loaf/\"&gt;The Definitive Guide to Long Animation Frames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Simplified performance budgets&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Last summer we made a &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/performance-budgets-major-update/\"&gt;major update to how you create, manage, and monitor performance budgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/budget-previews.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Our new Budgets dashboard gives you:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Centralized budget management&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Easier navigation and filtering&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Custom labels and descriptions to give more context at a glance&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Improved budget types&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Visualizations for rate of change budgets&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Alert history and audit history&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read: &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/complete-guide-performance-budgets/\"&gt;A Complete Guide to Web Performance Budgets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Waterfalls and the critical rendering path&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;When I talk with folks about performance, I stress the importance of focusing on what matters. (In fact, I did &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6gZp3-7w8c\"&gt;an entire talk&lt;/a&gt; about this at the &lt;a href=\"https://perfnow.nl/\"&gt;performance.now conference&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago.) The first step is identifying the critical rendering path for your pages.&amp;#160;Our revamped waterfall chart lets you do exactly that.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/waterfall.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Waterfall charts are an essential tool in your diagnostics kit. They let you see at a glance the number of resources on a page, the size and type of each resource, when each resource is called, whether or not it's a blocking resource, how long it takes to render, plus a wealth of deeper metrics around CDN, caching, and more!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Our newly updated waterfall has been in the works for a while, and it's a culmination of wish lists from our team. Now it's easier for you to:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Focus on seeing and optimizing the critical rendering path, to deliver a better experience to your users&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Spot the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element, so you can see if it's rendering too late&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Differentiate between connection state and rendering state for each resource&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Go deep into each resource request to diagnose the root cause of a performance issue&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who uses waterfalls every day to diagnose issues for SpeedCurve customers, I'm so excited to have this feature at my fingertips!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Real user monitoring for SPAs&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Measuring pages in a single-page application (SPA) requires a little extra work, because the start and end time of a page vary depending on the SPA's implementation. In September, we made that implementation a lot easier. New&amp;#160;&lt;code&gt;LUX.spaMode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/single-page-applications\"&gt;greatly simplifies implementing lux.js in a SPA&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Easier user permissions&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I love it when new SpeedCurve customers ask me how many end users they're allowed to add to their account, because I get to say \"As many as you'd like!\" We don't charge per seat and we don't limit account users.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;While that's great news for our customers, over time &amp;#8212; as you add more and more teams and users to your account (we have some customers with hundreds of end-users!) &amp;#8212; managing everyone's permissions can get unwieldy. So we made it easier. You can now manage individual user permissions across multiple teams on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/user-permissions.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Credit to Elena Kay for this awesome screenshot!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;To change user access across multiple teams at once:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ol&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to Admin &amp;gt; Users (requires Org Admin permissions)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Click on the username&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Choose team permissions for this user&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Click 'Save permissions'&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read: &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/edit-users-admins-teams\"&gt;How to add and edit users, admins, and teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;SpeedCurve is now part of Embrace!&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you missed the news, &lt;a href=\"https://embrace.io/blog/speedcurve-joins-embrace/\"&gt;SpeedCurve was acquired by Embrace&lt;/a&gt; in November! &lt;a href=\"https://embrace.io/\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; is a leader in user-focused observability, so we&amp;#8217;re combining forces to connect performance, reliability, and user experience across both web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/speedcurve-embrace.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the many things I've loved about joining forces with Embrace has been learning how the observability space dovetails with front-end web performance, and how we approach the idea of user-focused monitoring. It's super-interesting seeing how other folks interpret this. I've already learned a lot, and I know it's just the tip of the iceberg.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Big love to our extended web performance community&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Whew, that was a lot... and those were just the highlights!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I'm so proud of everyone in our community &amp;#8212; not just SpeedCurve, but also our customers, the hard-working browser teams, and the other vendors in our space &amp;#8212; who collectively work together to make the web better, faster, and more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that our community is driven by a shared desire to serve users. It's what keeps me inspired year after year. I'm already looking forward to what we'll achieve together in 2026!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/signup/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog-trials\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/559/customer-logos-free-trial-banner.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "title": "NEW! A trickle of updates to your waterfall charts",
    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"large-para\"&gt;Waterfall charts are the workhorse of any web performance enthusiast. SpeedCurve's interactive waterfall is one of the first components I designed and built more than a decade ago. I've just given our much-loved waterfall chart some team-inspired updates that you may find helpful in understanding how page construction affects important user experience metrics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/558/waterfall.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"Waterfall Chart\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;At SpeedCurve, we love incremental updates based on both external and internal user feedback. We dogfood our own products, and while consulting with customers, our in-house performance expert&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andydavies/\"&gt;Andy Davies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;is often confronted by the gulf between a customers questions and how he might answer those questions using the data we collect and the visulizations we wrap around it.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It's not always easy. Making data visible doesn't automatically mean it's useful in answering questions about the intersection of web performance and user behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Three years ago Andy asked me for a feature in the waterfall chart. I added it straight away, and to this day Andy has never discovered or used the feature!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;\"Wait, you can do that?\" &amp;#126; Andy&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If Andy uses SpeedCurve everyday, knows it inside out, and still can't stumble across a three-year-old feature,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;that's not Andy's problem&lt;/em&gt;. That's a problem with complexity in the user interface and feature discoverability. It's a common problem as software matures and features get layered on top of each other. What started out simple and easy to explore becomes complex and hidden behind a myriad of options.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I'm taking a crack at removing some options in the waterfall to reduce complexity and choice while exposing better defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping Andy sees the changes this time around and it helps answer more of his questions...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trim waterfall to timeline events&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/558/waterfall-trim.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"Waterfall trim\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;You'd be horrified by how many requests we see in some web pages. Thousands! A waterfall that big can be unwieldy to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;When you want to focus in on the critical rendering path and see what might be delaying an event like First Contentful Paint or Largest Contentful Paint, we now let you trim the waterfall to different timeline events. After the waterfall is trimmed, any requests that extend beyond the viewable timeline fade out to the right.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;This feature was inspired by the many talks Tammy Everts has given on &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6gZp3-7w8c\"&gt;focusing on what matters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Connection phases &amp;amp; LCP badge&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/558/waterfall-lcp.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"Waterfall connection phases\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;This one is all yours, Andy! For three years, you could toggle the request bars between content type or connection phase in the waterfall options. Now we've collapsed those options into the same view, taking inspiration from Pat Meenan's legendary WebPageTest.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The starting skinny bars shows the connection states of DNS, Connect, and SSL. The fat bar's colour shows the content type with the lighter shade at the beginning indicating time to first byte.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We also badge the request related to Largest Contentful Paint, making it easier to spot a late loading image in the waterfall. If LCP is a text node then the main HTML request will be badged.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Request headers &amp;amp; server timing&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/558/waterfall-request.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"Waterfall headers\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Cliff Crocker has been asking for this feature for years. When expanding a waterfall request, we now include tabs showing the raw headers. If you have any &lt;a href=\"/blog/server-timing-time-to-first-byte\"&gt;server timing headers&lt;/a&gt;, we yank them out into their own tab, making them easier to scan. You can really get deep into each request and diagnose exactly what the root cause of a performance issue is. No excuses.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;What's missing for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The interactive waterfall is one of the first components I designed and built over a decade ago (don't look at the source, it's embarrassing) and it's surprising how long it can take to cycle back around and iterate on designs. To be honest, it still needs a full redesign and rebuild in something like &lt;a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/webgpu/from-webgl-to-webgpu\"&gt;WebGPU&lt;/a&gt;. But small improvements add up and the waterfall chart has always been the workhorse of any web performance enthusiast. It deserves more attention.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;What small tweaks would make SpeedCurve more delightful and useful for you? &lt;a href=\"mailto:support@speedcurve.com\"&gt;Let us know.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/signup/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog-trials\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/558/customer-logos-free-trial-banner.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"large-para\"&gt;The goal of making websites faster is to make users happier. Since user happiness can't be measured directly, we launched the&amp;#160;User Happiness metric more than six years ago. We've just released a fresh User Happiness update to reflect changes in web browsers and the overall web performance space!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/new-user-happiness-column-chart.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"User Happiness plotted as a time series\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in October 2019, we released our&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/october-2019-news/\"&gt;User Happiness metric&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;with the goal of quantifying how a user might have felt while loading a page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Happiness is an aggregated metric that combines important user experience signals, gathered with real user monitoring (RUM).&lt;/strong&gt; To create the User Happiness algorithm, we picked metrics and thresholds that we felt reflected the overall user experience: pages that loaded slowly or lagged during interaction were more likely to make someone feel unhappy, whereas fast and snappy pages would keep users happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;More than six years later, we've updated User Happiness to reflect changes in web browsers and the overall web performance space. Keep reading to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why we updated User Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The web performance landscape was very different when we designed our original User Happiness metric.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer was still one of the most popular browsers. Safari didn't support any rendering-related metrics. Metrics that we take for granted today like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) didn't exist. Neither did Google's &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/get-started-with-core-web-vitals/\"&gt;Core Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt; project!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the metrics that we included in our original formula were cutting edge at the time, but today have fallen out of use:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;First CPU Idle was discontinued in May 2020&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;First Input Delay (FID) was discontinued in September 2024&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Long Tasks has more or less been replaced by &lt;a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Long_animation_frame_timing\"&gt;long animation frame (LoAF) timing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Start Render (First Paint) is becoming less common, with Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) being preferred&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Considering all this, it was obvious to us that User Happiness needed to be modernized.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Our new User Happiness formula takes into account the following metrics:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Time to First Byte (TTFB)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;DOM Content Loaded&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;First Contentful Paint (FCP)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Interaction to Next Paint (INP)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Rage Clicks (rapidly clicking the same element in frustration)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Page Abandonment (leaving the page before the &lt;code&gt;onload&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;event)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;The new User Happiness thresholds&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p class=\"two-up extra-wide\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/happiness-threshold-ttfb.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" /&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/happiness-threshold-dcl.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/happiness-threshold-fcp.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/happiness-threshold-lcp.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/happiness-threshold-cls.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/happiness-threshold-inp.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/happiness-threshold-rage-clicks.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/happiness-threshold-abandonment.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Why these metrics and thresholds?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing which metrics should contribute to create a single score or rating is always a interesting exercise. Some metrics are obvious choices, while others provoke long discussions. Examining data tests your assumptions and hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;After discussion and evaluation, we settled on these criteria for selecting metrics:&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;What does the metric actually measure and how does it relate to the user's experience?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;How well known is the metric amongst people who want to measure performance?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;How widely is the metric supported across browsers?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, and INP)&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Even though they're not fully supported across all browsers just yet, the three Core Web Vitals &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/understanding-and-improving-largest-contentful-paint/\"&gt;Largest Contentful Paint&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;(LCP), &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/understanding-and-improving-interaction-to-next-paint/\"&gt;Interaction to Next Paint&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;(INP), and&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/understanding-and-improving-cumulative-layout-shift/\"&gt;Cumulative Layout Shift&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;(CLS) &amp;#8211; are the obvious metrics to start with as base. They are well known, and with Safari adding LCP and INP support in the near future, they will also be widely supported across browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The next question we considered was &lt;em&gt;\"Which parts of the user experience do Core Web Vitals &lt;/em&gt;not&lt;em&gt; measure?\"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;First Contentful Paint (FCP)&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We're keen believers that showing content to visitors sooner rather than later is important for a good experience, and we have data to back this view up.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/metrics-glossary#first-contentful-paint-synthetic-and-rum---chrome\"&gt;First Contentful Paint&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;(FCP) represents this well.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;DOMContentLoad (DCL)&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;There can often be an 'uncanny valley' where a page is visually complete but isn't interactive yet, as deferred scripts don't execute until just before &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/metrics-glossary#dom-content-loaded-synthetic-and-rum---all-browsers\"&gt;DOMContentLoad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;(DCL). Executing those scripts early is important.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Time to First Byte (TTFB)&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there's &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/metrics-glossary#time-to-first-byte\"&gt;Time to First Byte&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;(TTFB). This probably created more discussion within our team than all the other metrics combined. Ultimately we included it because until the browser has some HTML content, it can't start creating a page. Getting that content to visitors quickly is key to a good user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The thresholds for the timing-based metrics &amp;#8211; Core Web Vitals, TTFB, FCP, and DCL &amp;#8211; have already been defined by the Chrome team as part of the Chrome User Experience Report. Rather than create a separate set of thresholds, we reused those. (Keep in mind that Google's thresholds are based on aggregate data. You should always look at your own data to determine the best thresholds for your own site.)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Rage Clicks and Abandonment&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We also decided to include some direct signals from the user: Rage Clicks and Abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/strong&gt; are when a visitor rapidly clicks or taps on the same spot on the screen. They're a good indicator of frustration.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abandonment&lt;/strong&gt; measures someone leaving a page before it's loaded (load event firing). It can be a hint that a page is loading too slowly.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Future metrics?&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We'll probably refine User Happiness again in the future, as there are other areas still to explore. For example...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page Reloads&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; When a visitor reloads a page, it may be a signal they had an unhappy experience.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abandonment&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; This may need refining to use Largest Contentful Paint / &lt;a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-soft-navigations-origin-trial\"&gt;Interaction Contentful Paint (ICP)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;as its end point. On fast retail sites, if a shopper abandons after the product image has been shown, that can be a hint that the product wasn't what they were looking for rather than the page being slow.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;How User Happiness is calculated&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;To calculate an overall rating, each metric is rated Happy / Okay / Unhappy against its own thresholds. Then the ratings are combined.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the metrics are rated as &lt;strong&gt;Happy&lt;/strong&gt;, then the page view is considered to be &lt;strong&gt;Happy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; of the the metrics are rated &lt;strong&gt;Unhappy&lt;/strong&gt;, then the view is considered to be &lt;strong&gt;Unhappy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Anything else is rated&amp;#160;&lt;strong&gt;Okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If a browser doesn't support a metric (e.g., CLS is not currently supported in Safari), then that metric is excluded from the overall calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;How to monitor User Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;You can see User Happiness charts throughout many of your SpeedCurve dashboards. The way it's presented hasn't changed, but the underlying numbers reflect the new formula. You'll see it plotted as a \"traffic light\" showing which proportion of your users' page views are Happy, Okay, and Unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/user-happiness-basic.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some use cases where User Happiness can be helpful...&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;See how User Happiness changes over time&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We give you &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/data-retention\"&gt;up to 13 months of RUM data&lt;/a&gt;, so you can investigate why user experience has gotten better (or worse) over extended time periods.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/user-happiness-time-series.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Drill down into underlying causes of user frustration&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;One new place you'll see User Happiness is in your dashboard and chart filters. You can now filter any of your RUM data by User Happiness Score, allowing you drill down and diagnose issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/user-happiness-filter.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, here on the RUM Compare dashboard, I can easily compare Happy and Unhappy page views side by side. This view quickly tells me that LCP and CLS are contributing to my Unhappy score, but INP is below the threshold so I don't need to focus on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/user-happiness-compare.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The other new place you'll see User Happiness is at the individual session and page view level. For example, in the RUM Page Views dashboard, when you expand a page view row you will see the individual metrics that make up that page view's User Happiness score. In the case of the screenshot below, the user's 'Okay' score was caused by DOM Content Loaded. All of the other metrics were happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/557/user-happiness-details.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;The future of User Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We want our User Happiness formula to reflect the real user experience as accurately as possible. As the web performance landscape continues to evolve, we will continuously evaluate the metrics that make up our User Happiness formula and make adjustments as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we recognize the importance of having stable metrics. We don't want you to feel like the goalposts are always moving. We'd love for you to be a part of the discussion. If you have opinions on the User Happiness formula, please send us a note at &lt;strong&gt;support@speedcurve.com&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2 data-start=\"3146\" data-end=\"3173\"&gt;Start exploring today&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p data-start=\"3174\" data-end=\"3386\"&gt;We&amp;#8217;re really excited about this release and hope you find it as useful (and satisfying!) as we do.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p style=\"font-size: 17px;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a SpeedCurve user&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8211; Log in today and check out your User Happiness results in your RUM dashboards.

It&amp;#8217;s about how we choose to evolve ourselves. That&amp;#8217;s why user experience, speed and curiosity are interlinked and matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll keep it succinct: each moment is precious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Faster speed = faster evolution. We need to keep pushing for the future we want.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;WWW&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;When the World Wide Web became accessible to everyday people in the mid-1990s, it fundamentally changed our relationship with information. The sum of all human knowledge began its transition into digital formats, making it available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection. Encode all the things!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/556/mosaic.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"Mosaic Web Browser\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mosaic, the first popular web browser, 1997&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I graduated from design school at the very start of that transformation, designing my first website in Mosaic with the newly released &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag. My entire career and every business I&amp;#8217;ve run has been tangled up in the web. I was &amp;#8212; and am &amp;#8212; completely enthralled by the unlimited access to information, to search and satisfy any curiosity as profoundly as I choose to go. I can jack my cyberpunk brain directly into the planet!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Speed&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;As a culture, we chase speed. Why is that? It feels evolutionary to me with you and me as nodes on the interplanetary network.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/556/cable.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gutta-Percha transatlantic cable, 1857&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Like the good old days of Morse code and those &lt;a href=\"https://atlantic-cable.com/\"&gt;first transatlantic telegraph cables&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;re now more and more intertwined in each other's lives with each new connection. That device you hold, the WiFi signal, the ethernet cable - hold one end of that connection, and you&amp;#8217;re now physically connected to billions of other people less than 160ms away. It&amp;#8217;s palpable, hard to ignore, often uncomfortable, and moves us forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I know this stuff is kooky. But take a moment to glance around. Digital technology and the web have fundamentally changed everything around you in the last 30 years. Some good, some bad, but at a consistently rapid pace.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to hold on as the planet rewires all the nodes and springs to consciousness, but the signs of accelerating change are everywhere. The information we consume and the choices we make based on that information matter. It&amp;#8217;s how we evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Each of us is on a speed curve.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;SpeedCurve&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;At its simplest, SpeedCurve has always been about facilitating the flow of information for web users. As curators of the web experience and guardians of how it feels to access &amp;#8220;all the things&amp;#8221;, &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt; is a fundamental tenet. Faster is better. Faster is more.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve focused on bringing the worlds of web design and engineering together in the service of a better, faster user experience for people on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;SpeedCurve appears to be a collection of charts, but it&amp;#8217;s actually a tool designed to facilitate conversation &amp;#8212; a conversation about the value your organisation creates and how each transaction with a user is expressed in a happy or unhappy experience. We provide the tools to interrogate that transaction, diagnose blockages, and keep the arteries of information flowing as open and as smooth as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/556/team.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"The SpeedCurve Team\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SpeedCurve team at one of our many Hawaiian off-sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m immensely proud of the people who work at SpeedCurve and the nature of the conversations we have with our community. We like to do things for the right reasons and in the right way. It&amp;#8217;s transformative when principles and profit align. Faster site, happier users.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re also just one node in the network. All of us here at SpeedCurve have found the web performance community to be deeply rewarding and driven by a shared sense of responsibility for the quality of the web experience. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL055Epbe6d5aoGuvCaRaznmt_mxWQs3pa\"&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/performance\"&gt;Smashing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2024/\"&gt;Performance Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://wpostats.com/\"&gt;WPOStats&lt;/a&gt;, WebPerf Days, &lt;a href=\"https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/rumcg/\"&gt;W3C groups&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/web-performance-ny/\"&gt;Web Perf Meetups&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://perfnow.nl/\"&gt;Performance.now()&lt;/a&gt;. The connections and commitment remain as we hop from company to company, topic to topic, and location to location, all while stewarding the web. Hat tip &amp;#127913; perf people!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;By caring about the flow and rendering of our web pages, we increase how quickly curiosity can be satiated, and how quickly our minds evolve. As we code and architect, we piece together an information experience that moves us along humanity's journey more quickly. Code as craft, code as convergence, code as compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It may not feel like much at the time, but every line of code contributes. The care you take to shape that code and the experience it embodies matters. The choices we make, the empathy we have for our users and their access to information matter. Keep it evolving. Keep it speedy!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;SpeedCurve + Embrace&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Today, SpeedCurve takes its own evolutionary step and joins &lt;a href=\"https://embrace.io/\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;. Embrace and SpeedCurve both share a deep commitment to putting user experience at the heart of our tools. By joining forces, we can accelerate the evolution of the web performance and observability landscape, bringing a focus on user experience to a broader range of organisations and across a broader range of interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/a-smarter-way-to-spot-performance-issues/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/556/vitals.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"Vitals Dashboard\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpeedCurve's new &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/a-smarter-way-to-spot-performance-issues/\"&gt;Vitals Overview dashboard&lt;/a&gt; with heatmaps that quickly surface where performance issues are hiding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Evolution is fun and important!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;For now though, you get to keep using SpeedCurve in exactly the same way, and we'll continue to add more great features.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;So what kind of node on the interplanetary network are you?

Honestly Austrailia when are you going to sort out your connection to the internet!\" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speedcurve's own performance data for our dashboards. We've got some issues with our blog post page performance, possibly the huge images I've been uploading!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Heatmaps are a powerful way to get an instant overview of&amp;#160;&lt;strong data-start=\"505\" data-end=\"544\"&gt;where performance issues are hiding&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;across your site. They let you break down your performance metrics (including custom metrics) by different dimensions &amp;#8212; including&amp;#160;&lt;strong data-start=\"648\" data-end=\"662\"&gt;page label&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#160;&lt;strong data-start=\"664\" data-end=\"675\"&gt;browser&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#160;&lt;strong data-start=\"677\" data-end=\"689\"&gt;location&lt;/strong&gt;, and&amp;#160;&lt;strong data-start=\"695\" data-end=\"710\"&gt;device type&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; so you can easily spot anomalies and patterns in your web performance data.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, you might notice that a specific browser or region consistently loads your site more slowly, or that certain pages are lagging behind the rest. Heatmaps make it easy to visualize and spot those differences at a glance, helping you pinpoint where to focus your optimization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-start=\"2870\" data-end=\"2904\"&gt;Smarter insights, less noise&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p data-start=\"2905\" data-end=\"3139\"&gt;To make sure you&amp;#8217;re not chasing false signals, we&amp;#8217;ve also added our new&amp;#160;&lt;strong data-start=\"2975\" data-end=\"3002\"&gt;low-sample data warning&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;for RUM. This flags when data might be misleading because of a small sample size &amp;#8212; helping you focus on real issues, not red herrings.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p data-start=\"2905\" data-end=\"3139\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/555/low-data.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"Low data sample\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2 data-start=\"3146\" data-end=\"3173\"&gt;Start exploring today&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p data-start=\"3174\" data-end=\"3386\"&gt;We&amp;#8217;re really excited about this release and hope you find it as useful (and satisfying!) as we do.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p style=\"font-size: 17px;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a SpeedCurve user&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8211; Log in today and check out your new heatmap chart type in your Favorites dashboards.

    "title": "2025 Holiday Readiness Checklist (Page Speed Edition!)",
    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 22px;\"&gt;Delivering a great user experience through the holiday season is a marathon, not a sprint. Here are 25 things you can do to make sure your site is fast and available every day, not just Black Friday.&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/523/holiday-readiness.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Your design and development teams are working hard to attract users and turn browsers into buyers, with strategies like:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;High-resolution images and videos&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Geo-targeted campaigns and content&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Third-party tags for audience analytics and retargeting&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;However, all those strategies can take a toll on the speed and user experience of your pages &amp;#8211; and each introduces the risk of introducing single points of failure (SPoFs).&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below we've curated 25 things you can do to keep your users happy throughout the holidays (and beyond).&lt;/strong&gt; If you're scrambling to optimize your site before Black Friday, you still have time to implement some or all of these best practices. And if you're already close to being ready for your holiday code freeze, you can use this as a checklist to validate that you've ticked all the boxes on your performance to-do list.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Optimize your monitoring&lt;/h1&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;By now, you're most likely getting ready to head into a holiday code freeze/thaw/chill &amp;#8211; which means you may not have a lot of opportunities to make big changes or optimizations. Here are a few things you can tackle right now that don't necessarily require higher-level approval or extra costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use both synthetic and RUM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;1. Explore free tools&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this item is easy to check off. If you don't have a monitoring solution in place for the holidays, there are a lot of free trials out there you can use &amp;#8211; including &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/signup/\"&gt;ours&lt;/a&gt;! (Not sure if you need synthetic &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; real user monitoring? &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/synthetic-vs-real-user-monitoring/\"&gt;You probably need both.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;2. Work around RUM deployment challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Real user monitoring (RUM) can sometimes be harder to implement on short notice compared to synthetic tools. &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/tag-managers\"&gt;Use a tag manager&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., Google Tag Manager) or A/B testing tool if you need to circumvent code changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;3. Use CrUX in a pinch&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you're still out of luck in the RUM department, you can always look at field data from &lt;a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux\"&gt;Google CrUX&lt;/a&gt; (Chrome User Experience Report). &lt;em&gt;Caveat: &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/crux-rum-synthetic-web-performance-monitoring/\"&gt;CrUX data isn't true RUM.&lt;/a&gt; It's collected from Chrome sessions only, and only for certain types of Chrome users.&amp;#160;It also filters out origins and pages that don't meet specific eligibility requirements. But CrUX data is better than no RUM data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track the right metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;4. Think beyond Core Web Vitals&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/get-started-with-core-web-vitals/\"&gt;Core Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt; are typically a big focus for retailers because they have a direct impact on search rank, they are not the only indicators of a good user experience. In fact, for a lot of customers, iOS traffic &amp;#8211; which Vitals can't track &amp;#8211; is the most popular and has higher conversion rates. With so much of your revenue at stake, relying only on Core Web Vitals creates a huge blind spot.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;5. Consider adding custom metrics&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you need to track iOS traffic and other clients,&amp;#160;&lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/custom-metrics\"&gt;custom metrics&lt;/a&gt; let you measure what is most important to your business.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;6. Don't forget about backend time&amp;#160;&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/diagnose-time-to-first-byte/\"&gt;Time to First Byte (TTFB) can be a page speed killer&lt;/a&gt;, especially during peak traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/523/ttfb.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;7. Track your CDN&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you use a content delivery network (CDN), then you need to know that CDN performance is critical during the holiday season. Did you know that you can &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/server-timing-time-to-first-byte/\"&gt;track the health of your CDN&lt;/a&gt; in RUM using server-timing headers? Capture cache hits/misses, time spent at the edge, origin, and even round-trip time (RTT) for most major CDN providers.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage third-party scripts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The average web page has 35+ third-party scripts. The average blocking time for the 10 most popular third parties is 1.4 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Third parties can hurt important metrics, like Core Web Vitals. More important, slow or blocking third parties can hurt how users experience your site, which in turn can hurt your user engagement and business metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/523/third-parties-no-bckgrnd.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;8. Audit the third-party scripts on your pages&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I'm always amazed at how many sites have third-party tags that are no longer needed or in use. Remove unwanted scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;9. Defer or load asynchronously&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Avoid single points of failure by deferring non-essential scripts or loading them asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;10. Set up tracking and performance budgets&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Focus on third parties that are business critical or, more important, critical for the user experience. (More on performance budgets and alerts in section 6, below.)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;11. Know your SLAs with third-party vendors&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If possible, ask vendors about their release schedule during the holidays to avoid unpleasant surprises.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;12. Put together a playbook for third-party failures&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a simple guide that includes a point of contact for each script, kill switches, or procedures to remove scripts using a tag manager.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Dig deeper into these tips and more with this &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/third-party-web-performance/\"&gt;guide to monitoring and optimizing third parties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the pages that matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;For both RUM and synthetic monitoring, it's important that you are both measuring and classifying pages correctly. This is especially true as you get closer to holidays, when the performance of a product page can make or break a user's purchase decision.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;13. Segment your pages in RUM&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/rum-page-labels\"&gt;Add RUM page labels that segment your pages&lt;/a&gt; in a way that makes sense for your business and prevents confusion where you have too many unique values when trying to dissect performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;14. Label your pages in synthetic&amp;#160;&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/synthetic-page-labels\"&gt;Make sure your labels make sense&lt;/a&gt;, but more important, ensure that the URLs you are monitoring are still valid. For example, last year's product link may no longer be relevant for a PDP page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;15. Test your campaign landing pages&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Campaign landing pages are often outsourced to agencies that cannot (or do not) test with performance in mind. As a result, &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/campaign-landing-page-speed/\"&gt;campaign pages can be the slowest pages on your site&lt;/a&gt;. Ensure you're monitoring current campaign landing pages early, before the promotion starts, in order to identify any performance gotchas during the main event.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect metrics to business outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;16. Set a baseline for understanding the impact of performance on your customers (and your business metrics)&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Using the metrics you&amp;#8217;ve already identified, &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/site-speed-business-correlation/\"&gt;create correlation charts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;(like the one below) that show you the relationship between your performance metrics and business metrics, such as conversion rate. This will help you understand what your performance budgets should be as you move into peak.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/523/correlation-chart.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;17. Benchmark your site against your competitors&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Setting up a &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/competitive-benchmarking\"&gt;competitive benchmarking dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#8211; which is easy to do with synthetic monitoring &amp;#8211; is an effective way to see who's delivering a good UX and who isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/523/competitive-benchmarks-retail-us.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=\"https://app.speedcurve.com/benchmarks/\"&gt;these industry benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; for a current snapshot of how leading sites perform across a number of industries, including retail, travel, media, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up reporting early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;18. Set up automated reports&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Be proactive in reporting to stakeholders. Consider setting up &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/reports\"&gt;automated weekly reports&lt;/a&gt; for different stakeholder groups.&amp;#160;Make sure people have visibility into the metrics&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;care about.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/523/report.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;19. Set up reporting ahead of time so key stakeholders know what to expect&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Reach out to them proactively to make sure they don't have any questions about the data they are receiving and what the metrics mean. (Need help explaining what the difference page speed metrics mean and why they matter?

Fight regressions with performance budgets&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/complete-guide-performance-budgets/\"&gt;performance budget&lt;/a&gt; is a threshold that you apply to the metrics you care about the most. You can create budgets for almost any performance metric, including Core Web Vitals.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;You can then configure your monitoring tool to &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/performance-budgets-and-alerts\"&gt;send you alerts&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; or even break the build, if you're &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/continuous-integration\"&gt;testing in your staging environment&lt;/a&gt; as part of your CI/CD process &amp;#8211; when your budgets are violated.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/523/budget.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/complete-guide-performance-budgets/\"&gt;This guide&lt;/a&gt; goes into much more detail about how performance budgets work and how to set them up, but here are the key points:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Establish budgets for your key metrics&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Create budgets for render-blocking third parties and third parties that are known to have Long Tasks&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Set up alerting, but be wary of creating alert fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Again, make sure that alerts go to the right people&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h1&gt;Holiday post-mortem&lt;/h1&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It's common for people to put more effort into preparation. It's also common for the holiday season to take it's toll. We highly encourage taking some well-deserved time to yourself after the holiday crunch is over &amp;#8211; but before you do, here are a few things that will help you unload after the holidays, and put you in a great position to hit the ground running in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at your historical data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;21. Identify each anomaly and drill down into your data to understand why it happened&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Post-mortems shouldn't be about finger pointing. Identifying issues that could have been prevented ensures you are ready next time.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;22. Report issues to third-party vendors&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you experienced issues with any of your third parties, share your data with the provider and work with them to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve your monitoring and testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;23. Identify changes in user behavior&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Use your RUM data to identify how user behavior may have changed during the holiday period. Make note of heavily trafficked pages that you were not monitoring synthetically. Your users should help dictate what you are monitoring. Were you prepared for changes to traffic patterns? Can what you observed potentially help with scalability testing?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;24. Use the data you're gathered above to refine your synthetic testing&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Update URLs, browsers, devices, geolocations, etc. to align with what you've learned about your users via your RUM data.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate wins!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;25. Acknowledge the great work that got you through the holidays&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The long hours. The attention to detail. The collaborative cross-functional team spirit that all went into creating a great user experience. We see you!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Send out a fun post-holiday card across your org, using your data to celebrate wins such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uptime&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Was your site available 99% of the time or more? That's a win!&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key performance metrics&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Did you stay within your regression thresholds for important metrics like backend time, start render, and Core Web Vitals? That's fantastic and definitely worth sharing.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third parties&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Were your third-party scripts performant throughout the holidays? Shout it from the rooftops!&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business metrics&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Do your correlation charts show that you delivered a speedy experience to a significant amount of your converted traffic? Huge win!&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/523/dog-party.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's not too late!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you're like me and this season has crept up on you, fear not!

You're putting a lot of money into getting people to your landing page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow pages have a direct impact on conversion rate.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://contentsquare.com/blog/interaction-to-next-paint/\"&gt;Contentsquare aggregated data from 997 of their customers' retail sites&lt;/a&gt; and found the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Visitors who experienced good INP (&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/understanding-and-improving-interaction-to-next-paint/\"&gt;Interaction to Next Paint&lt;/a&gt;, a performance metric that measures the responsiveness and usability of a page) had a &lt;strong&gt;25% better conversion rate&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;than users experiencing poor INP.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Users who experienced poor INP were &lt;strong&gt;more likely to bounce or express frustration&lt;/strong&gt; (via rage clicks or multiple interactions) than users who experienced good INP.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/contentsquare-conversions.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slowness affects your brand.&lt;/strong&gt; Not only does a faster page boost conversion rate, it also helps ensure that users have a positive perception of your brand &amp;mdash; meaning they're more likely to return and shop with you again.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Yet performance issues on landing pages go unnoticed&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;A campaign landing page should be the MOST scrutinized page of your site during a sales and marketing campaign. Yet too often it's an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, landing pages are packed with all kinds of sales and marketing widgets that scrutinize so many parts of the customer journey &amp;mdash; social, retargeting, cross-selling, up-selling, A/B testing, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;But that level of scrutiny doesn't extend to understanding:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;the speed and usability of the page&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;how users&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;perceive&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;speed and usability&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;the impact of user-perceived speed and usability on bounce rate and conversion rate&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;All of those metrics are measurable, but too often they're not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Why is page speed ignored?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Campaign landing pages tend to exist underneath the umbrella of marketing. That means they're not always subjected to the same rigour &amp;mdash; from a web performance and usability perspective &amp;mdash; as the evergreen pages on a site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(IMPORTANT: I am *not* throwing marketing folks under the bus here. This is an issue with company-wide &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/performance-culture-best-practices/\"&gt;performance culture&lt;/a&gt;, not any one team. More on that later in this post.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;In my experience, there are a few common reasons why the speed and usability of landing pages are overlooked:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pages are designed by external agencies&lt;/strong&gt;, who are disengaged from the lifecycle of the page. Design is treated as a thing that happens at the beginning of a project, so designers don't see the page through to production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pages are built on ecommerce platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(e.g. Shopify, Wix, Squarespace), where it's very easy to add plugins without understanding the impact on page speed.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pages are not performance tested before release.&lt;/strong&gt; Because they're outside the purview of the performance engineering team, campaign pages are not tested while still in their staging environment, using whatever synthetic performance monitoring tool the performance team regularly uses. (Learn more about &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/private-qa-development-and-staging-websites\"&gt;pre-release testing&lt;/a&gt; in your staging and dev environments.)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pages are not monitored after release.&lt;/strong&gt; You're probably familiar with the idea of \"war rooms\" on Black Friday and other major retail events. The war room team monitors the site closely for performance disruptions, slowdowns, and other anomalies. Yet campaign pages are often released quietly and without dedicated eyes on their performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Performance audit: Awaytravel.com&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;For this post, I decided to randomly audit one of the pages that had slower rendering times. (Note that this is NOT a name-and-shame exercise. Away is a great company that I have a tonne of respect for.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Initial rendering times are slow&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;This campaign page doesn't start to render until 4.3 seconds, and it takes more than 9 seconds for the largest visual element to render in the viewport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/away-lp.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;We typically want to see pages start to render in less than 2 seconds. Google considers &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/understanding-and-improving-largest-contentful-paint/\"&gt;Largest Contentful Paint&lt;/a&gt; (LCP) slower than 4 seconds to be poor. Faster LCP times correlate with greater engagement and &amp;mdash; crucially important &amp;mdash; higher conversion rates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/away-lcp.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Let's dig into what's slowing down this page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;There's a LOT of JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at the composition of this page, we see that it's fairly large, at around 6MB. More notably, this page contains a very large number of requests &amp;mdash; 493 in total, with 330 of those requests in the form of JavaScript.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/away-lp-content-breakdown.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Excessive JavaScript is always a red flag, but it's not always a cause for concern. If most of these JS requests are being called after the important visual content has rendered and the page has become usable, they're not necessarily an issue. I've seen very large pages, with tonnes of JS, that were still highly performant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The next step is to figure out if all these scripts are helping or hurting the page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;The critical rendering path is cluttered&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Before we investigate what's making a page slow, it's essential to understand the &lt;strong&gt;critical rendering path&lt;/strong&gt;. The critical rendering path is the set of steps a browser takes to convert all a pages resources &amp;ndash; from images and HTML to CSS and JavaScript &amp;ndash; into a complete, functional web page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the critical rendering path means:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking a good look at the order in which the resources on your pages render.&lt;/strong&gt; Does essential content and scripting load first? Are non-essential or lesser resources deferred?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making sure that each resource in the rendering path is as performant as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Are images optimized? Are you using a content delivery network (CDN) to bring elements like images closer to your users, so that delivery times are faster? Are you compressing and caching the right things?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to investigate the critical rendering path is to look at a &lt;strong&gt;waterfall chart&lt;/strong&gt; for the page. A waterfall chart shows you all the resources on the page, the order in which each resource is requested by the browser, and the size and duration of each request, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a high-level waterfall for the Away campaign page. It shows how key metrics align with the rendering timeline (the filmstrip view at the top of the chart).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/away-waterfall.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;I'm not sharing a visual of the fully expanded waterfall, because it contains more than 600 items, but I can share that more than 400 resources are requested before the LCP event happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;strong&gt;there are more than 400 items in the critical rendering path for this page&lt;/strong&gt;. In an ideal world, the critical path could have as few as three or four requests: the initial HTML, render-blocking CSS (if necessary), render-blocking JS (again, if necessary), and hero image.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Third-party JavaScript is an issue&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;To investigate the performance of third-party JavaScript,&amp;nbsp;we can take advantage of a nifty feature in SpeedCurve (available under 'Options' in the top right corner of the waterfall), which lets you learn which requests have high CPU usage, as well as excessive main thread activity.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It also lets you group third-party scripts from the same provider so you can get a better sense of the subsequent calls each script generates, along with the performance impact. (Learn more about &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/first-third-parties\"&gt;third-party tracking&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/options-new.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;With third parties grouped, we can see a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This page contains a large number of third-party scripts&lt;/strong&gt;, including Google Tag Manager, Google Ads, Tiktok, Reddit, Facebook, Pinterest, Criteo, and Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bulk of these third-party calls happen before LCP&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; in other words, in the critical rendering path.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some third parties, such as Google Tag Manager, incur a significant performance penalty.&lt;/strong&gt; As you can see below, GTM calls 13 resources and has a total Long Tasks time of 497 milliseconds. (Any task greater than 50s is a cause for concern.) Excessive Long Tasks don't just mean slower rendering times. They also mean that the page can feel unstable as users interact with it.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/away-google-tag-manager.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #000000;\"&gt;This site is a Shopify storefront&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;As more and more retailers of all sizes migrate to Shopify, it's not a surprise to see that this site is built on Shopify. Many of the 64 Shopify requests are from the theme (which appears to be a custom theme) that this storefront is built with.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/away-shopify.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;(Not all Shopify themes are created equal. Some are definitely more performant than others. Lucky for the rest of us, Sia Karamalegos &amp;mdash; a performance consultant who also happens to be a Shopify expert &amp;mdash; maintains &lt;a href=\"https://themevitals.com/\"&gt;Theme Vitals&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that lets you test the speed of your Shopify theme. She recently posted a list of the &lt;a href=\"https://themevitals.com/fastest-shopify-themes/\"&gt;fastest Shopify themes in 2025&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h3&gt;Shopify plugins: Death by a thousand cuts&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Selecting a fast Shopify theme is just the first step. You also need to ensure that all those plugins &amp;mdash; which can be dangerously easy to install with just a click or two &amp;mdash; aren't slowing down your pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;On this landing page, there were a number of plugins that delayed rendering:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/klaviyo-email-marketing\"&gt;Klaviyo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; 43 requests, and a total Long Tasks time of 432ms (see below)&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/wishlist-king\"&gt;Swish&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; 20 requests&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/intelligems\"&gt;Intelligems&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; 12 requests&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/gladly\"&gt;Gladly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; 9 requests&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/friendbuy-lite\"&gt;Friendbuy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; 2 requests&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;The irony is that many of these plugins are intended to &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; conversions. &lt;strong&gt;To be clear, the issue isn't necessarily with the plugins themselves: it's with their implementation.&lt;/strong&gt; If a service isn't needed early in the page's life cycle, it shouldn't be part of the critical rendering path.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/away-klaviyo-2.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when we look at a waterfall chart, it's easy to see the one thing that's slowing down a page. More often than not, though, we see scenarios like this, where's there's no one big problem &amp;mdash; it's more like death by a thousand cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;As more and more sites are built using platforms or frameworks that make it easy for performance issues to creep in, this problem is only going to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;(If you have a Shopify storefront and you want to monitor the speed and usability of your pages, you can easily&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/speedcurve-rum-shopify/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enable SpeedCurve RUM in your Shopify store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Not only can you track page speed, you can also see how it correlates to business metrics like conversion rate!)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Who should be responsible for your landing pages?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;At the top of this post, I mentioned &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/performance-culture-best-practices/\"&gt;performance culture&lt;/a&gt;, and why your company needs to have one. Simply put, everyone who touches a page should care about how that page performs in the wild.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/552/perf-culture.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're an executive&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Here's what the most successful websites have in common: they all have a performance and usability champion in a corner office. While performance is a shared responsibility, YOU are responsible for building a culture of web performance throughout your company. (I did a talk about this at &lt;a href=\"https://perfnow.nl/\"&gt;performance.now()&lt;/a&gt; a few years back. If you're interested, you can &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE0HhF4TO0Q\"&gt;watch it here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a marketer&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; When you're tasked with building campaign pages (or any pages) on platforms like Shopify, Wix, and Squarespace, it's important to know how easy it is to accidentally introduce issues that slow down your pages. You need to performance test your pages using tools like &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/\"&gt;SpeedCurve&lt;/a&gt; or WebPageTest. Not sure how to use these tools? Get your dev or engineering team to show you. (If you're a SpeedCurve user, or even if you're just curious, send us a note at support@speedcurve.com and we'll show you how to test your pages and find your page speed bottlenecks!)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a design agency&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Keep in mind that page speed is a critical usability factor. When you build landing pages for clients, you need to test those pages for performance. (We have a number of agencies that use our tools to test their clients' sites. Contact us at support@speedcurve.com to find out how you can do the same!)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a developer or engineer&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; If campaign pages are built outside your purview, you can still be a force for good. Teach your marketing team or agency how to use synthetic testing tools to test new pages after they go live. Remind them to communicate with you when new pages are live so you can monitor them using your real user monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Make sure your landing pages stay fast&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;A campaign landing page should be the most scrutinised page of your site during the holidays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ol&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure everyone who touches the page understands the relationship between &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/why/business-and-seo/\"&gt;page speed, user experience, and conversion rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/why/automated-and-continuous/\"&gt;Create a testing workflow&lt;/a&gt; before new pages are put into production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/continuous-performance-monitoring/\"&gt;Monitor continuously&lt;/a&gt; to prevent &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/third-party-web-performance/\"&gt;third-party surprises&lt;/a&gt;.

For example, you can choose to test your product page on a 3G network, from Italy, on a Chrome desktop browser.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real user data (sometimes called field data)&lt;/strong&gt; is performance data collected from real users as they browse your site under a wide variety of contexts (different browsers, devices, connection speeds, locations, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Or to put it simply:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Synthetic data helps you understand &lt;strong&gt;your pages&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;RUM helps you understand &lt;strong&gt;your users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;There's never been much merit to the debate of &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/synthetic-vs-real-user-monitoring/\"&gt;real user monitoring (RUM) versus synthetic monitoring&lt;/a&gt;. They both have different uses and most companies should really be using both.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because synthetic data is so controllable and repeatable, you have a very clean set of data to look at.&lt;/strong&gt; This makes it easy to spot regressions and improvements. You can also capture a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of detail on each test, empowering your teams to dig deep into understanding exactly what is going on in their pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/479/waterfall.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;And because synthetic lets you test any URL, not just your own pages, you can do things like &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/competitive-benchmarking\"&gt;benchmark your site against your competitors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/479/benchmarks.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real user data, on the other hand, can be very noisy. But its comprehensiveness is also one of its strengths.&lt;/strong&gt; RUM data captures data from every possible scenario, giving you insight into how your site performs in the real world across experiences you may not even have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/479/rum-dashboard.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;RUM data also lets you &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/site-speed-business-correlation/\"&gt;correlate performance data to business and user behavior metrics&lt;/a&gt;, such as conversion rate and bounce rate. This is absolutely critical to sustaining a long-term focus on performance at any organization.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/479/correlation-chart.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Because they play different roles, both synthetic and real user monitoring play a critical role in any company's &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/performance-culture-best-practices/\"&gt;performance culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a third form of front-end performance data was released: the &lt;a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux\"&gt;Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)&lt;/a&gt;. We often get asked where CrUX fits in the monitoring landscape (and we have a &lt;a href=\"https://support.speedcurve.com/docs/speedcurve-rum-vs-crux-data\"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; that covers why your RUM and CrUX data may not match), so here's our take.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;First, what is CrUX?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;CrUX data is technically field data. It's collected from real users, not from synthetic tests. But CrUX data is definitely not RUM, or if it is, then it's a very limited form of RUM with some heavy caveats:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CrUX data is collected from Chrome sessions only.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no visibility into what is happening in Safari, Firefox, Edge or any other browser used. We often see sites with 70-80% of traffic that is NOT included in CrUX.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means your mobile Safari traffic is not measured.&lt;/strong&gt; People often forget just how much of their traffic comes from mobile Safari.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CrUX data is also only collected for certain &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of Chrome users.&lt;/strong&gt; Specifically, users who:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Enable usage statistic reporting&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Sync their browser history&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t have a sync passphrase set&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology#user-eligibility\"&gt;supported platform&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CrUX data also filters out origins or pages&lt;/strong&gt; that don't meet specific &lt;a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology#eligibility\"&gt;eligibility criteria&lt;/a&gt; on at least 80% of their traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a limited amount of metrics available.&lt;/strong&gt; At the time of writing, &lt;a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology/metrics\"&gt;there are only about a dozen performance metrics you can track&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can't correlate CrUX data to your business metrics.&lt;/strong&gt; There's no way to flag any conversions or get bounce rate data, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;CrUX is NOT a substitute for RUM&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;If you were shopping for a RUM provider and a vendor told you that they had the perfect solution except:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;it only recorded data from a single browser&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;and only a few metrics&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;li&gt;and only from a very particular subset of your users...&lt;/li&gt;&#13;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;...well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound particularly robust, does it?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;All of that is to say: while CrUX is sometimes referred to as real user monitoring, it's actually something very different than traditional synthetic and RUM tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;But CrUX data can serve other purposes&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few situations where CrUX can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google uses CrUX data when it factors performance into its search algorithm.&lt;/strong&gt; Search is a very important consideration for most sites, and this alone makes it worth monitoring your CrUX data. For all the reasons above (the heavy subsetting), in addition to the fact that CrUX data is collected in different ways than a traditional RUM beacon, the &lt;a href=\"https://www.speedcurve.com/web-performance-guide/how-to-trust-your-metrics/\"&gt;data will not line up directly with what you see in other tooling&lt;/a&gt;. But tracking CrUX data for your site may help give you visibility into how well your site is optimized for search.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CrUX data lets us do competitive benchmarking based on field data.&lt;/strong&gt; Competitive benchmarking is a very effective way of helping organizations rally around site speed. Traditionally, benchmarking was only possible with synthetic data. CrUX lets us set up competitive benchmarking using some field data as well, which can be a nice way of augmenting existing synthetic benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, CrUX data can help bridge the gap for companies still working on implementing a full RUM solution.&lt;/strong&gt; CrUX falls short of being a full-blown RUM solution, but for companies still working on getting RUM in place, CrUX can be a nice way to at least get some visibility into what is happening in the field. Limited visibility is still better than no visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Synthetic, RUM, and CrUX data each have their place&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;It's important to keep in mind the limitations of each monitoring tool and what they're best used for so we don&amp;rsquo;t make the mistake of overlooking valuable insights.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- notionvc: 108cab80-1765-4a4c-af5c-94f4d9f1b10f --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthetic data&lt;/strong&gt; is relatively clean and detailed, but not comprehensive in terms of testing the full spectrum of user experiences. Use it to guide your design and development process, and to help spot potential regressions and improvements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CrUX data&lt;/strong&gt; is field data that is important for search, but it is a very specific subset of your traffic from a single browser with no ability to connect business and user metrics. Use it for real-user competitive benchmarking, and to help you keep on top of how Google views your site from a search perspective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real user data&lt;/strong&gt; is comprehensive field data covering the full spectrum of user experiences. As such, it should be your ultimate source of truth in terms of how you're doing. Use it to see how your site performs in the real world and to correlate business and user metrics to performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;To use a somewhat obscure cheese metaphor, CrUX can give you a good initial sniff at performance issues, but it&amp;rsquo;s no &lt;a href=\"https://thecheeseatlas.com/cheese-profiles/epoisses-de-bourgogne/\"&gt;&amp;Eacute;poisses de Bourgogne&lt;/a&gt;. RUM, on the other hand, gives you the full flavour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"blog-img\" src=\"https://blog-img.speedcurve.com/img/479/cheese2.png?auto=format,compress&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;w=2000\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;\n&lt;h2&gt;Does it sound like we're announcing CrUX within SpeedCurve?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;\n&lt;p&gt;Not quite, but we are exploring the idea. What are your thoughts? How would the CrUX dataset complement the data you're already getting from SpeedCurve Synthetic and RUM?
