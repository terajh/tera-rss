    "title": "Bear Head (Dogs of War, #2) [book]",
    "partialText": "Really enjoyed this follow up to Dogs of War.\nI accidentally read Dogs of War in 2018 - I never went looking for it and loved it. Equally, I can't remember when I found out about Bear Head but I knew I wanted to read it if it existed in the same universe. So finally I get around to it.\nOverall well written, well drawn characters with distinctive voices in a universe that's really not that hard to conceive. I've read a few of Tchaikovsky's books now and as much as I enjoy them, for some reason it does take me quite a stretch to read the books (this one being just ~315 pages and took me a month) - not sure what's up with that.\nThe story is told from three protagonist's perspective: Honey, the bear from Dogs of War - once soldier, now an academic arguing for rights for others. Jimmy, the &quot;grunt worker&quot; placed on Mars to prepare it for the colonies that plan to settle and Carole (Springer…I want to say), the PA and &quot;collared&quot; assistant to the antagonist Warner S. Thompson.\nSimilarly with Dogs of War, Bear Head discusses self and identity (can a person be entirely digital?), freedom and slavery, and the untouchable super rich and their power.\nThere's some pretty horrible scenes around human slavery where people are compelled to perform, both involuntary physically but also compelled to think in certain ways (i.e. being submissive by design).\nWith a lot of what I'm reading lately, I can't help but associate it with today's real life events (in 2025-2026), and thinking of the corruption throughout politics we're seeing today - though I can see how this book being published in 2021 aligns fairly well with Trump's first regime from '17-21. Perhaps it's that backdrop that makes me a slow reader!",

This part of the book was really lovely to read, but seemed to all be crammed in at the end.\nThe story also includes a very manipulative character, Kajii, and whilst I read I felt sorry (and frustrated) for the protagonist, Rika, that she couldn't see the obvious manipulation (but perhaps that's the point, when we're close up to manipulation, we can't see the wood for the trees).\nThere really is a lot (of meaty subjects) in this book, and perhaps this contributed to my slow reading but it did leave me struggling to carry all the ideas through to the end of the book.\nI've written about urgency in writing, and that's what helps me turn the page.

    "title": "Handing over to the AI for a day [blog]",
    "partialText": "Context: back in March 2025 I decided to put aside my scepticism and try AI driven development for the day. I appreciate that in 8 months, the AI landscape, particularly around agentic software dev has moved along, and perhaps this should have been posted originally back in March. All the same, maybe this is useful to some degree, if only to capture what it was like in time.\n\nWhilst I sit squarely in my AI-sceptic seat, I was recently prompted to try a different tact by two post I read a few weeks back.\nThe first was Bruce's colonoscopy post, yes, that one. It was in fact that he was using a local LLM to create a generative image to commemorate his visit. I'd been using chatgpt (for code and electronics, basically a NLP version of a search engine), and hadn't considered that perhaps I could host myself to take some responsibility for one of the two problematic aspects of LLMs today (first being power consumption, second being the global theft).\nThe second post was Simon Willison's post on how he created a mini tool (the post is much broader than that, a useful read). It wasn't the post so much but the tool he was using: Claude Code. So far with chatgpt I'd copy back and forth errors and tweaks when it was helping me. Although I also have copilot enabled in VS Code it really holds down to autocomplete at a pretty junior level.\nI'll often have typescript errors (for work) that copilot claims it can help fix, only resulting in even more typescript errors - so as a rule, I tend to avoid generating code fixes with copilot.\nBut what Simon showed with a shared transcript between himself and Claude Code was the software making the changes and offering diffs.\nSo that was what prompted a mini journey, and here's how it went.\nOffline LLMs\nPreviously I had installed command line tools and even Ollama on my Mac without having the faintest idea how to use them effectively - so they sat idle and unused.\nI'm not sure how, but I came across Msty, a tool that purported to make using local LLMs very easy. For a change, that seems to be true.\nSince I still had Ollama running (though I should have probably ejected it), Msty quickly linked up to this and discovered (though I'd forgotten) that the DeepSeek R1 model was loaded already.\nI figured since I was primarily using LLMs for software development, it made sense to find a model that suited those requirements.\nNot quite that simple, or certainly not if you (ie. me) doesn't have the LLM lingo and terminology down.\nI did some searching online, found a few articles, which themselves read as if they had been generated by AI, offering feature reviews of LLM models, but I couldn't find anything that said &quot;model X is excellent for Y software development&quot;.\nAdditionally, I found some models on huggingface.io, and figured that 7B was going to be easier/more viable to run than a 70B (big numbers need big machines? I was guessing…). However putting the name of the model into Myst yielded a lot of results and I couldn't really tell you what the difference was. More importantly, I couldn't quite be sure of the provenance (and whether that even matters…I'd assume it did).\nI ended up installing the following models:\n\nllama 3.2 (2gb)\ndeepseek coder v2 (which blew up)\ncodellama (3.8gb)\ncodellama 13b\nWizardCoder (I think the 3gb one?) (it just didn't reply on the query)\nWavecoder-ultra-6.7b (literally never worked for me)\n\nI tried a number of technical problems without much success and did capture the output for a number of these models to try to solve a Home Assistant automation process (which you can see here).\nIt's entirely likely there's better models out there for what I wanted to do. I did know I didn't need a model to know everything, so some focus (and thus: reduced size) would make sense.\nHowever, not one of these gave useful replies to my questions.\nMy favourite (fail) was giving code-llama a question that read: this query gets all the lessons matching these lesson slugs (I gave it the actual SQL query), how do I get a list of all the slugs that didn't match?.\nThe LLM happily reported that I was trying to learn Spanish:\n\nThe provided code contains a list of sentences that are written in Spanish, and the goal is to translate them into English. However, there are some errors in the provided code that need to be fixed before it can function properly. Here are some issues with the current code:\nMissing curly braces around the translate function definition: The translate function should be defined as a separate named function expression, like this: { translate } = require(&quot;google-translate&quot;);. This will ensure that the function is properly closed and can be used in other parts of the code.\n\nFor some reason it was using the slugs in the query as the most important part and completely ignoring the technical query.\nFor the most part, the responses I got were fairly hand wavy, text heavy (which I didn't want since I was asking about code), and in most cases irrelevant to my task.\nI think em0ry42 on BlueSky sums up what I was seeing:\n\nSmaller self hosted models will always under perform the larger ones. I think your experience and those of the other commenters are consistent with the current reality of these technologies. They can't do what people are promising. Yet.\n\nI'm sure there are people who can tune the hell out of their setup, but sadly, running any decent LLM locally as a useful code assistant, is just not here for the rest of us.\nSo I parked that for a while, and turned my attention to Claude Code.\nCoding without touching code\nI've no clue how new Claude Code was at the time, though I've gathered it's fairly new. It's a solid product from my experience (where I even managed to lose track as to which company owns which weirdly named AI thingy).\nSetup and interface is entirely on the command line, so already we're speaking my language.\nI'd seen demos of developers who've been able to join up their entire codebase to the LLM but each time I'd dabbling, I would quickly get lost and give up.\nClaude Code does exactly this without the walls I'd experienced in the past.\nI am however, acutely wary that Claude is running on a remote machine, and likely to be chonking through so much power that we're just throwing away water to keep machines from burning up. Let's stick a pin in that (and gosh, I loath myself already for that).\nThe very first problem I wanted it to solve was where I was trying to download 1,000s of videos and they all needed to be added to one massive tarball (context: this is for work, to allow users to bulk download our assets).\nI'd hit a problem where the tar process kept throwing an unhelpful exception the evening before and no amount of documentation on the library I was using helped me.\nOvernight I had a suspicion as to the cause and it gave me an idea to try - but I thought I'd let Claude try first, see what it does.\nWithout any specific direction (ie. my idea for the fix), and only the name of the file and the function the problem happened, Claude Code suggested the same solution I had in my head.\nThe UI then offered a syntax highlighted diff of the change it wanted to commit to disk. I was able to review it (very much how I'd approach a code review) and all I then needed to do was hit enter to accept.\nI tested the code in a separate terminal and indeed the change worked.\nGiven this positive start, I then spent most of the working time split between the Claude Code UI and in the terminal to run the main program (which was sequencing a very large dataset).\nThe code changes for the most part were always good and code that I accepted.\nThe experience was…weird. I'd heard of LLMs being referred to as junior developers but when I was going back and forth between chatgpt and vscode (again, for me, copilot never really came in useful), because of the amount of interaction that was required from me, it felt even less than working with a junior.\nBut this was a much closer experience. I'd describe the change and logic, sometimes pointing to filenames that would offer useful context, and Claude would spend some time (and money) thinking, then it would ask me to check a diff.\nWeirdly I spent more time sitting and staring out the window waiting for code to come back than I did looking at code. It was a weirdly hands off experience. I can't tell where I sit on that.\nThe main criticism that I had is that, because we use specific rules for typescript (no any and types are defined, which I think seems okay), Claude wouldn't really follow those strict rules, so I needed to go in at the end to clean that part up.\nThe secondary criticism is more a matter of taste. The code (and logging) was verbose to my taste. Additionally, being outside the code for the majority of the work period felt really strange. Sort of like a self-driving car took me the majority of my journey, deciding itself the navigation, for me only to be needed for the final arrival through some tight country lanes. Or something!\nA cost\nSince I was freestyling my way on Claude Code, I did manage to rattle through $5 of credit. I did think this was (somehow) linked to my Google business account, but I'm now suspecting it was free credit to introduce me to their API.\nAfter running through this credit now twice (I switched to my personal account for a second run) I've discovered there's tools to help manage that sprawling cost (such as /compact and /clear to reduce how much context the LLM is fed before giving me a result). I'd like to play with this more to get an idea of how much I'm really prepared to pay.\nAlso after writing (most of) this post, I came across an interesting project that takes the Claude UI and lets you connect up your own backend. I've not tried it yet, but I'd be interested to see if I can connect to a local LLM and try out results (though going by the current experience, it's going to have a hard time competing).\nSince it was conversational...\nI decided to hack together a simple keyboard keycap (I had spare) with an ESP32 board to emulate a keyboard.\nThen this would send a (fairly) unique keycode that then launched a python command which started a whisper based script that let me talk, then pasted the text into whatever was focused.\nThis meant I had: press button, say the thing, press the button, wait for it to be done.\nIt wasn't great because it was a little clunky, but it definitely felt futuristic!\nHow I felt afterwards\n(I'm now writing this 8 months late, but I remember how it felt on the day).\nEven though I was surprised at the progress of the work, both for how terrible the local code solving was and how impressed I was with Claude Code - it did leave me with a feeling of disconnect.\nThere's certainly the issue with the maintainability of pure vibe-coded software, but this was something more.\nThere's a creative input that I put into my coding process. A sense of purpose and achievement in solving some complicated problem, or writing a line of code that I'm particularly pleased with. There wasn't really of that feeling of connection with the output.\nHaving written this retrospectively I know that my perspective has changed somewhat, but I do remember have this weird dissonance between the outcome and the experience of getting there.",

    "partialText": "I'd recommend anyone who wants to understand the emergence of AI and OpenAI in particular to read this book.\nI do struggle reading non-fiction, and this book was no different. It took me nearly 2 months to finish reading (in my evening snippets) - but it was definitely worthwhile. It was this 90 minute interview by Novara Media with Karen Hao that made me immediately purchase the book.\nI don't think I can fully review this book and do it justice, but I can share what I learnt from the book where my original assumptions were wrong about AI and AI companies.\nThe book is focused primarily around OpenAI and Sam Altman, and in particular how his ousting in November 2023 came to be, through hundreds of interviews and documents, and paints a very insightful picture of the messiah complex (though not in her words) that Altman has.\nHere's a short summary of things I didn't know but learnt through reading this:\n\nAltman and friends started conversations (and business, albeit initially as a non-profit, though that didn't last) in 2015 because they were going to build AGI and that it was inevitable.\nThe company was formed with scientific researchers originally, again as an open company with the intent of sharing, though spoiler alert: this all changed\nI had always assumed it was cowboy bro developers working on the code, but it was, originally, academic based engineering\nAI safety was constantly there and initially significant - but as we all know now, eventually lost a battle to make an impact, left &quot;hobbled&quot; and thrown rather to the wayside.\nThe training data was, after GPT-2, ingested wholesale and attempt to clean/sanitise would happen on the results coming from prompts - i.e. the inputs were not cleaned, which means applying dizzying array of filters to catch on the output and edge cases.\nCommon Crawl was introduced at GPT-3 - which is also where the input filtering stopped happening\nAI, or Western AI companies including OpenAI (but also Google and Microsoft) put their data centres in the Global South, additionally sourcing their data annotators from the poorest countries allowing them to pay (via third parties) literal pennies per hour for the work (which could also come with terrible mental health side effects as the worker would read and view the generative content that AI could come up with based on the unfiltered dark corners of the web)\nSam Altman lies. Little lies, but from a great deal of documentation, a lot and often to tell people what they want to hear whilst (we guess?!) having some ulterior motive\nThe path that OpenAI decided to take to head towards what they believe will be AGI, effectively requires unlimited compute power, when in reality, there are lots of different applications of AI that don't need that level of power, Stable Diffusion being one such example trained using 256 GPUs (still not a desktop computer, but not hundreds of thousand GPUs either)\nOpenAI's approach, to close off it's scientific findings, close it's source and refusing to share methods means that there's no way to verify any of their progress, but more importantly is stripping the academic scientific community of it's researchers (as someone who has visited CERN on two occassions, seeing science being shared is incredible and incredible for society)\n\nMy only complaint about the book (and it's likely to be my own fault) is I had trouble with the jumping backwards and forwards in time - I'd often be unsure where we were in the timeline.\nIf you work in tech, I'd absolutely recommend this book. If it's not possible, then definitely the interview I linked above.",

It was a sweet story, set in the 80s, but I'm not sure where the arc was.\nThe story is told from the perspective of Lizzie, an 18 year old young woman who moves out of home to work as an assistant to a dentist. The dentist himself is fairly sexist and xenophobic. The mother (of the protagonist) is … hard to describe. In short, she's a pain in Lizzie's arse - though she definitely loves her.\nI think there's some part of flying the nest and finding your own feet, but Lizzie somehow ends up in a very similar place by the end of the book. There's times I was reading and thinking surely she's going to realise that she herself is actually a good dentist and will take that path, but nope, she ends up as a clothes store assistant, so … I don't know.\nIt was cute to have 80s nostalgia peppered throughout the book, the highlight being the salad spinner (which my own mother still owns and I definitely remember spinning it for fun).\nI guess I was left with the sense of why did I read what I read?",

Milligan would write letters offering support to others, and would often talk about how the NHS support was missing the love and understanding and rather delivered pills (which he says helps, but only as a band-aid).\nIt was these last group of letters, mostly about sending out love and positivity to the world that brought this up from 2 stars to 3.

    "title": "Making a Killing (DI Fawley #7) [book]",
    "partialText": "Wanted to like it more, the gimmicks frustrated me.\nI've read every DI Fawley book and I've always enjoyed them. I'm starting to think of these books as a bit of guilty pleasure. However, I'm limited to reading on the Kindle which means the medium which I read is rather specific.\nHunter will (as in: has also done in the past books) sandwich in content from different sources to give the story a bit more reach out into the world. I remember the earlier books would have tweets (and I think reddit threads, maybe) which would be between chapters (chapters being dedicated to telling one of the characters story and perspective).\nThe problem with the inserts is that on a Kindle these are actually images that are embedded, and trying to read the text in them, because the text doesn't scale, means zooming, and attempting to drag the image around, usually to read from one side of a sentence to the other.\nThis time around I just skipped them entirely - some of these included newspaper articles. I've no idea if they added anything to the story, if they contained plot points, or if they were decoration (more akin to the tweets in the earlier books). It's just too hard to get the text.\nAnd then there's the perspective change with a font change. I use the Open Dyslexia font set at a size that helps me to read. This book then employed a completely different font for when the antagonist shares their story. One that's very, very thin and I noticed I would visibly struggled to read these pages.\nAll these points have nothing to do with the story, but unfortunately they had an impact on me being able to enjoy the story - because it kept taking me out. I really do wish these gimmicks would be used as an exception, rather than peppered or even core to specific characters talking.\nFunnily enough, the book ends (sort of abruptly) and after the closing chapter and the author thanks, there's a mini story at the end. This is told from Adam Fawley's perspective, no gimmicks and it was super - I couldn't put the book down until I had finished this last section. This just reminds me that I really do enjoy Hunter's stories, and the characters and they can definitely stand strong on their own two feet.",

    "partialText": "Facinating for when it was written, but felt like it was sort of missing a story.\nI'm definitely reading these older classics so that I acquaint myself with what I've assumed all my peers read when they were younger, so this eventually made its way into my reading list.\nIt's an incredible story given when it was written, late 1800s, and I can imagine it blowing minds at the time when it was read. The technicality of the book is interesting too, how there's a story inside of the story whereby the … character we're following (not narrator, but not really the protagonist) is sharing the experience with the reader. In fact, the majority of the book is a straight up monologue. Then to compound this, it's the Time Traveller (I guess the protagonist) in the present, sharing their past experience of living in the futre!\nTimey wimey.\nBut I wasn't really expereiencing the technical feats, more following the story along, and that's where, for me, it was sort of lacking. There wasn't really a story. In the sense that there were cause effect, struggles to overcome and character arcs.\nThe Time Traveller meets and partners with a woman in the story, but when she's taken by the Morlocks and he just… goes okay &quot;then, I'm off.&quot;.\nIt's likely that I missed something in the story, but it didn't land so well for me. I think it's interesting, but I didn't come away thinking about the content of the story, the questions it could raise.\nThe very, very end is bold, and I definitely appreciated that, but it really didn't add anything either.",

I know Octopus does have APIs (which isn't our supplier), and there's a specific smart meter that also makes the data available on MQTT - but it's been out of stock for (at least) the last 12 months.\nHowever, this last weekend I discovered, so long as you have a smart meter, you can actually collect this data from the DCC.",

    "partialText": "Reeks of &quot;cosy crime&quot; - and that's good.\nThere's a reason that Richard Osman's series has been a runaway success for many people (or at least I can believe it) - the story is well written, the characters are extremely well drawn and the pages are a pleasure to digest.\nI keep thinking I'm further along in the series than I actually am because the characters have quickly become a staple of crime fiction in my head.\nAlthough I did find I was a little suprised at the some of the more grusome passages (realising that doesn't really fit the &quot;cosy crime&quot; sub-genre). Those parts did take me out of the story a little. Again, I feel like I've had more of these characters than I actually have (this is the second Thursday book I've read), so there's no reason why a few hard edges wouldn't be part of the story.\nI did, however, have one complaint. I was quickly getting annoyed with the diary that Joyce would write in. For some reason I was having a hard time believing that Joyce was writing diary entries in such a conversational style as a pen and paper job, especially when the style of her writing/thoughts read as if she would be telling her husband… who's already shuffled off. I'm not 100% sure why I found it distracting, but I suspect that's not going to reduce any amount in the next Thursday books, so I'll probably need to find a way around it.\nOtherwise, a lovely read. Definitely feels as if I'm visiting these characters, and it's always a pleasure sharing a bit of time with them all.",

The story absolutely drives forward. There are lots of (I thought) nice turns of phrases throughout the book that didn't feel too forced.\nThere's really only one (biggish) plot hole based around the amount of time that passes, which the story does attempt to address, but I was so caught up in the page turning that it didn't particularly impair on the enjoyment.\nFun stuff!",
