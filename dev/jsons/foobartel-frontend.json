You can get rid of using some of your media queries. There are quite a few examples of new properties and functions that, when used properly, will make your code a little prettier, a little more modern and a little more fun, because new ;) One of my favorite examples in this article is the following code, which basically can serve as your new version for a centered container (wrapper) class, spacing included:</p><pre><code class=\"language-css\">.container {\n  width: min(100vw - 3rem, 80ch);\n  margin-inline: auto;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Below you can find the slightly more advanced rule which uses a CSS custom property with the <code>80ch</code> value from above as the fallback, in case custom properties are not supported. Pretty neat.</p><pre><code class=\"language-css\">.container {\n  width: min(100vw - 3rem, var(--container-max, 80ch) );\n  margin-inline: auto;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>So far I haven't worked much with <code>clamp()</code> and friends yet, but this definitely is something to pack into the toolbox for 2022.

There are many ways of how we can design and build things for the web, yet people want to stick with what they know. The things everyone uses for their site. Hamburger menus. Carousels. Modals. Many others. The things that have been confirmed as “working well” by the mass market. They offer security, the safety net of “so many people can’t be wrong”. This is an unfortunate fact, because there are lots of ways how things on the web could be better and less boring. Unfortunately the majority often isn’t right, they go with what they can find, out on the cheap and free design template market. As a result, the opinions on what’s best practice get skewed.

    "title": "Better Text Decoration With CSS’ text-underline-offset",
    "partialText": "<p>I recently came across the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">text-underline-offset</a> CSS property and I’m really surprised that I wasn’t aware that this fairly new property existed. There have been many times in the past where I wanted some more spacing between the characters and the underline and in many cases, I would then fall back on <code>border-bottom</code> in combination with a little bottom padding.</p><p>I have been putting this newly found, little helper into good use a few times recently, and it feels like a great improvement. Not only does it improve the visual look, but I find that it makes the underlined word, which is mostly a link, much more legible.</p><p>This is how <code>text-underline-offset</code> looks like in action: </p><pre><code class=\"language-css\">.example1 {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  text-underline-offset: auto;\n}\n\n.example2 {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  text-underline-offset: 0.2em;\n}\n\n.example3 {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  text-decoration-thickness: 0.25em;\n  text-decoration-color: darkseagreen;\n  text-underline-offset: 0.125em;\n}</code></pre>\n<p class=\"example1\">Ex 1: The fairy loved to dance on top of underlined letters</p>\n<p class=\"example2\">Ex 2: Other times it was possible to crawl between the offset</p>\n<p class=\"example3\">Ex 3: A solid underline made sure she would never fall and disappear</p><p>I’m not aware of any special guidance of <code>text-underline-offset</code> in terms of accessibility, but it serves as a nice addition to make text links a little more legible and easier on the eye, at least for some font choices, especially at small font sizes. Other than that, it also allows for some nice, creative possibilities to make things look a little more interesting.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>Ever since Apple released macOS Catalina in 2019 and changed the default shell to zsh across its operating system, I’ve been meaning to follow this move and change my default shell from the good old bash to zsh.</p><p>With my current setup, I used a few lines from <a href=\"https://github.com/mdo/config/blob/main/.bash_profile\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this profile</a> to display the current git branch with the prompt. I never took the time to do some research and look into the topic, because all things shell is clearly not my comfort zone. Hence I also never found out how easy it could have been to get the same setup with zsh as I had all that time.</p><p>It seems that showing the git branch in Terminal is quite a common thing to do nowadays. I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/foobartel/status/1481968496322162691\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asked on Twitter</a> and got some helpful pointers, and off I went into shell land. </p><p>I looked at <a href=\"https://starship.rs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Starship prompt</a>, which works cross-shell, and with that I’m now running zsh as my default shell, inclusive of displaying the current git branch. Starship has a lot of options for configuration and you can easily pick the ones you need and like. It has a good documentation that without much time required, allowed me to add the options I wanted. After all, this wasn’t as scary or difficult as initially assumed. </p><blockquote>\n  I’ve switched my prompt to starship a few years ago and have found that largely eliminated any motivation to switch to zsh lol    <footer>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wong_jim/status/1483107748019589131\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/wong_jim/status/1483107748019589131</a>  </footer>\n  </blockquote>\n<p>That said, I’ve been doing fine with bash all those years and don’t use the shell to an extend that I’d notice all the advantages, but at least I got rid of the constant reminder of the new default shell and it feels like I’m up to date again.</p><p>I also found two more links that do the same without any additional tools, in case this is your cup of tea:</p><p>- <a href=\"https://medium.com/pareture/simplest-zsh-prompt-configs-for-git-branch-name-3d01602a6f33\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simplest ZSH Prompt Configs for Git Branch Name</a><br>- <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/reinvanoyen/05bcfe95ca9cb5041a4eafd29309ff29\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Add Git Branch Name to Terminal Prompt (MacOS Catalina zsh)</a></p>",

    "title": "Finding the Currently Focused Element",
    "partialText": "<p>When doing accessibility audits (or even daily web use), too often I come across sites that are missing focus styles. When navigating via keyboard, it can be difficult to see which element you are currently on and hence, lose sight of where you are on a page.</p><p>To quickly find the currently focused element, we can use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/activeElement\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">activeElement</a> read-only property of the <code>Document</code> interface. Despite its rather confusing name, it does return the focused element. </p><p>To use it, open the DevTools Console (cmd + i, then ESC, or click the Console tab) and type the following, short command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.activeElement;</code></pre>\n<p>This will give you an instant preview of the focused element name. Press Enter and Console will expand the output and return the currently focused element, including its content. You can then hover the Console output to see the highlighted element in the browser window.</p><p>The next time you are styling <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#interactive_content\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">focusable elements</a>, aka links, buttons or form fields, it‘s a great idea to take the extra time to add visible <code>:focus</code> styles. It can also look great and will show the care of your craft. It will make navigating pages more usable and enjoyable, especially when relying on visible focus styles for navigation.</p><p>Update:</p><p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo/status/1478027778184429568?s=21\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pointed out</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Manuel Matuzo</a> on Twitter, it‘s possible to tie <code>document.activeElement</code> to Chrome DevTools <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/live-expressions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Live Expressions</a>, which allows you to log the current element automatically when changed. Makes a lot of sense when you think about, but I was not aware that this feature exists. Since Chrome 70.

Sometimes <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">event handlers</a> need to get attached to single elements, other times adding to multiple elements at once can be neccessary.</p><p>Most of the time when I do need to add it to multiple elements, I can’t remember… This post serves as a little reminder for myself (and possibly you), in case I forget again, which is pretty surely going to happen. And that’s ok.</p><p>Adding an EventListener to a single element that is listening to the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click event</a> often looks like this.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.querySelector(&#039;.button&#039;).addEventListener(&#039;click&#039;, event =&gt; {\n  // do something on click\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Yet sometimes you want to add an EventListener to multiple elements. This can be helpful when you want to execute the same function on different elements, e.g. each with its own parameter, option, etc. </p><p>One way to add an Event Listener to multiple elements is by using the convenience of a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for…of</a> statement, which creates a loop to iterate over its passed elements.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">let buttons = document.querySelectorAll(&#039;.button&#039;);\n\nfor(i of buttons) {\n  i.addEventListener(&#039;click&#039;, function() {\n    // do something on click\n  });\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Another way to add an EventListener to multiple elements is by using a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forEach()</a> loop.</p><p>With <code>querySelectorAll()</code> we’re selecting all elements with the <code>.button</code> class, then we iterate over all of these elements with  <code>forEach()</code> and add the EventListener (for the ‘click’ event) to each of them. The code to do so looks like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.querySelectorAll(&#039;.button&#039;).forEach(item =&gt; {\n  item.addEventListener(&#039;click&#039;, event =&gt; {\n    // do something on click\n  });\n});</code></pre>\n<p>For situations where elements do not have the same class name, but require the same EventListener, it’s possible to create an array to select all elements.</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">[document.querySelector(&#039;.button&#039;), document.querySelector(&#039;.other-element&#039;)].forEach(item =&gt; {\n  item.addEventListener(&#039;click&#039;, event =&gt; {\n    // do something on click\n  });\n});</code></pre>\n<p>By now and with the above examples, you (and my future self) should have a good idea on the different possibilities of how to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">addEventListener</a> on multiple elements. With that, go build something and have a nice day! </p><p>Please reach out if you have any comments or further improvements to the above snippets. </p>",

    "partialText": "<p>When Dropbox launched in 2007, it was the tool that everyone had been waiting for. Simple file and folder synchronisation between different computers made easy.</p><p>Over time and like so many others, <a href=\"https://dropbox.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dropbox</a> have added many more features, and I started to like it less and less. For a while I used to pay for the product, yet stopped at some point, mainly because I didn't need much storage space or used it as much anymore. Some privacy concerns did play into this decision, too.</p><p>Today I’m still using it, but am not paying for a subscription anymore. Space is limited and I sometimes run into storage limitations, which can sometimes be a little inconvenient. During our time working on the now defunct Colloq, Tobias introduced us to <a href=\"https://syncthing.net\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Syncthing</a>, which we’ve used for internal file sharing. Syncthing used to be a little complicated to get up and running, but since then has improved and quick to <a href=\"https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">get up and running</a>.</p><p>Syncthing does a great job of synching files and folders with different computers, without the middle man of the “cloud”. It doesn’t serve as a “backup” solution, since it only synchronises files on different machines, without storing files in the cloud. Once a file is deleted, it will be removed from all other machines, if synchronised. This makes for a great deal of privacy, if you’re into that kinda thing ;)</p><blockquote>\n  <strong>Private.</strong> None of your data is ever stored anywhere else other than on your computers. There is no central server that might be compromised, legally or illegally.  </blockquote>\n<p>For small teams or simple computer to computer file sharing, Syncthing is a great alternative to Dropbox. It comes as a free, open source, secure and simple piece of software. Its file size limitations are those of the machines that you are synchronising, not what a subscription plan allows. It does exactly what I got from Dropbox in the early days. One thing, namely synchronisation, done well.</p><figure data-ratio=\"auto\" class=\"\">\n\t\t\t<picture>\n\t\t\t<source srcset=\"https://foobartel.com/media/pages/notes/syncthing/a24134f1dc-1650440755/screenshot-1200x-q60.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://foobartel.com/media/pages/notes/syncthing/a24134f1dc-1650440755/screenshot-1200x-q55.png\" alt=\"The Syncthing web interface screenshot syncthing.net\" loading=\"lazy\" >\n\t\t</picture>\n\t\n\t\t<figcaption>\n\t\tThe Syncthing web interface screenshot from syncthing.net\t</figcaption>\n\t</figure>",

    "partialText": "<p>For all of my Kirby projects the content folder usually is excluded from the Git repository, and hence the content does not get deployed with new releases. To create a development preview that always features the latest content from the production site, I recently set up a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cron job</a> that replicates the Kirby content directory from its production location to the develop environment.</p><p>This is a simple one-liner which makes working with the development site more convenient, because any new features or bugfixes can be previewed and tested with the latest content from the live site.</p><p>For the replication to happen, I’m using a simple shell script which then gets called via a cron job at a certain time interval. I think case I’m running the script once a day, but it’s possible to tweak the cron job interval to your own liking and requirements.</p><p>To copy the content folder I’m using <code>rsync</code> (<a href=\"https://rsync.samba.org/documentation.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a>), which is an open-source utility for transferring and synchronizing files.</p><p>The simple syntax for the command is: <code>rsync [OPTION...] SRC...

Many hosting plans come with an interface to create and configure cron jobs, otherwise it’s neccessary to <a href=\"https://crontab.guru/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">create one</a> from scratch.</p><p>As a result, the above script will be automatically executed at the set interval (e.g. every day at midnight) and copy the complete content directory and all of its subdirectories to the development server. </p>",

I wish there was more of this all over the web, yet it’s refreshing to see it every once in while.</p><p>Check out the worst volume controls on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/search?q=volume&amp;restrict_sr=on\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reddit</a> or find a <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/the-worst-volume-control-ui-in-the-world-60713dc86950\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compilation</a> on UX Collective.</p>",

    "partialText": "<p>I’ve been running the new <a href=\"https://getkirby.com/releases/3.6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Kirby 3.6 alpha</a> for a few versions now and my favorite new feature is the support for AVIF and WEBP image generation. I’m a sucker for better web performance and finally finished my small improvement to the image block. This version of the image block outputs a picture element with an AVIF, WEBP and the original format image. The width and quality parameters are currently hard-coded at 1200px and 60%/55%, respectively, which works well for me so far. Mileage might vary.</p><p>For a future iteration I want to add a field for image width and quality, but for now this simple version will do.</p><p>Find the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/foobartel/9cd81f653111f94bf3982f5bddaddb1d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">code in this Gist</a>.</p><p></p>",
