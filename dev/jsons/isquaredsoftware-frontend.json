    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time reading (and participating in) discussions in the React community, across many different sites. Over the last few years I&#39;ve seen an increasing amount of frustration and concerns from the community, questions about the motivations and intent behind React&#39;s development, and a growing disconnect between how the React team wants React to be used, and how the ecosystem is using React in practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve put together this talk to explain and clarify what I&#39;m seeing argued about. My goal is to answer questions, provide background context and explanation, highlight places where I&#39;m seeing disconnects, and hopefully point out ways that things can be improved going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;react-summit-2025&#34;&gt;React Summit 2025&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first did this talk at React Summit in June 2025. Here&#39;s the slides:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-state-of-react-and-the-community-in-2025-slides-presentations-2025-06-state-react-community&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/2025-06-state-react-community/&#34;&gt;The State of React and the Community in 2025 - slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll link the video of that talk as soon as it&#39;s available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also got to participate in a follow-up panel discussion on &amp;quot;The State of React&amp;quot;. I&#39;ll link the video of that panel once it&#39;s available as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-details-the-state-of-react-and-the-community-post&#34;&gt;More Details: &amp;quot;The State of React and the Community&amp;quot; Post&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with the talk, I&#39;ve published an extensive post on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2025/06/react-community-2025/&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;The State of React and the Community in 2025&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This post goes into further details on the same topics, including more background and explanations of the pain points and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this adds more depth to the limited amount of material I was able to cover in the talk!&lt;/p&gt;",

    "partialText": "&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, the state of React and its ecosystem is complicated and fractured, with a mixture of successes, skepticism, and contention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the positive side: React is the most widely used UI framework, and its concepts have influenced the rest of the JS ecosystem. The React team recently released React 19 after multiple years of development. This was a huge release, including official stable React Server Components support, the new &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; hook for handling promises, multiple new form integrations, and the removal of many long-deprecated and obsolete features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I&#39;ve observed and experienced that &lt;strong&gt;the React community has had a growing sense of frustrations and disagreements on where React is headed, how it&#39;s developed, and the recommended approaches for using React, as well as the interactions between the React team and the community&lt;/strong&gt;. This in turn overlaps with dozens of different arguments that have ricocheted around the React and general web dev communities in the last few years, as well as specific technical concerns with how React works, comparisons with other similar JS frameworks, and how web apps should be built going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes this a lot worse is that everyone is arguing and debating a different subset of these concerns, and &lt;strong&gt;many of the stated concerns are either false or outright FUD&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately, the arguments and fears have also been complicated by &lt;strong&gt;communications problems, self-inflicted marketing mis-steps, and lack of developer relations work from the React team itself&lt;/strong&gt;. All of these intertwine heavily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been involved in many related discussions on social media. I&#39;ve written numerous comments both defending and critiquing the React team, explaining why they made certain decisions or how things actually happened, pushing for improvements to docs and explanations, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to cover just &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; some of these topics has required an extensive and detailed post (and I&#39;m not even going to touch on the &amp;quot;is React bad / how does React compare to other tools?&amp;quot; topics, which are even further out of scope). But, having spent far too many hours debating and explaining, I feel the need to write a consolidated post that covers many of these topics together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also presented &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2025/06/presentations-react-community-2025/&#34;&gt;a talk based on the topics in this post&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My goals for this post are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give an overview of how React has developed over time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describe the forces driving React&#39;s development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify why and how React&#39;s recent development directions have happened, and explain some of the architectural decisions behind that work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify and dispel FUD and confusion regarding the motivations and intent behind React&#39;s development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;table-of-contents&#34;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#background-my-role-and-involvement-in-the-react-community&#34;&gt;Background: My Role and Involvement in the React Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#biases-and-caveats&#34;&gt;Biases and Caveats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#a-brief-history-of-react&#34;&gt;A Brief History of React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#react-s-relationship-with-its-owners&#34;&gt;React&#39;s Relationship with Its Owners&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#facebook-meta&#34;&gt;Facebook / Meta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#vercel-next-and-react&#34;&gt;Vercel, Next, and React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#react-usage-patterns&#34;&gt;React Usage Patterns&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#standard-react-architectures&#34;&gt;Standard React Architectures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#react-build-tool-usage&#34;&gt;React Build Tool Usage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#inside-react-server-components&#34;&gt;Inside React Server Components&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#react-server-component-development-and-vercel&#34;&gt;React Server Component Development and Vercel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#rscs-frameworks-and-bundlers&#34;&gt;RSCs, Frameworks, and Bundlers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#community-concerns-and-confusion&#34;&gt;Community Concerns and Confusion&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#concern-vercel-next-and-react&#34;&gt;Concern: Vercel, Next, and React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#concern-react-only-works-with-next&#34;&gt;Concern: React Only Works with Next&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#concern-react-might-someday-stop-working-in-client-apps&#34;&gt;Concern: React Might Someday Stop Working in Client Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#concern-why-is-react-pushing-frameworks&#34;&gt;Concern: Why Is React Pushing Frameworks?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#concern-server-component-docs-and-explanations&#34;&gt;Concern: Server Component Docs and Explanations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#takeaways-from-the-concerns&#34;&gt;Takeaways from the Concerns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;background-my-role-and-involvement-in-the-react-community&#34;&gt;Background: My Role and Involvement in the React Community&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;aka &amp;quot;who am I, why should you trust my descriptions, and why should you care at all what my opinions are about this? 😄&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am not and never was part of the actual React team&lt;/strong&gt;. That said, &lt;strong&gt;I&#39;ve been deeply involved with the React ecosystem since 2015&lt;/strong&gt;, and it&#39;s fair to say I&#39;m as much part of the &amp;quot;React community inner circle&amp;quot; as anyone outside of Meta or Vercel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve used React since 2015&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I maintain the Redux family of libraries, contributed to React, and been involved in React ecosystem discussions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve written numerous lengthy tutorials on React and Redux, and frequently speak on React and Redux&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve been involved in moderating major React community sections most of that time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want the long version:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;details class=&#34;detailed-explanation&#34;&gt;\n  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;My Accomplishments, Involvement, and Credentials&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started learning React in mid-2015, after using Backbone, jQuery, and GWT to build some geospatial visualization apps. Over the next year, I went from &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2016/09/how-i-got-here-my-journey-into-the-world-of-redux-and-open-source/&#34;&gt;reading a few React tutorials, to lurking in the Reactiflux chat channels, to answering so many questions I became a moderator, to volunteering to write a Redux FAQ, to being handed the keys as the new Redux maintainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve maintained Redux since mid-2016. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2019/10/redux-toolkit-1.0/&#34;&gt;I created Redux Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; as the modern way to write Redux apps. While working on Redux, I&#39;ve designed and shipped &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/11/react-redux-history-implementation/&#34;&gt;every version of React-Redux since v5&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve had multiple conversations with the React team about how React should work with external state management libraries, and I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1808&#34;&gt;the sole alpha-tester for the development of the &lt;code&gt;useSyncExternalStore&lt;/code&gt; hook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written hundreds of thousands of words of tutorials and blog posts teaching people how to use React and Redux and how they work, including the &lt;a href=&#34;https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Redux Essentials&amp;quot; tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and my widely acclaimed &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/05/blogged-answers-a-mostly-complete-guide-to-react-rendering-behavior/&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Guide to React Rendering Behavior&amp;quot; post&lt;/a&gt; (which is routinely recommended by the community as the single best explanation of how React actually works in practice). I&#39;ve written thousands of comments and answered questions across Github, the Reactiflux Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Hacker News, and Stack Overflow, about all things React and Redux and JS. I&#39;ve been referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/about/#oss-support&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;the tech support for the React community&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the master archiver and indexer of all things React&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/&#34;&gt;spoken at numerous React-related conferences&lt;/a&gt; on topics ranging from &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2023/08/presentations-react-rendering-behavior/&#34;&gt;how React works&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2024/11/presentations-maintaining-community/&#34;&gt;best practices and lessons learned maintaining widely used OSS libraries&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve been on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations&#34;&gt;numerous podcasts discussing React and Redux&lt;/a&gt;, including the ongoing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reactiflux.com/transcripts/tmir-2024-12&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;This Month in React&amp;quot; podcast hosted by the Reactiflux Discord&lt;/a&gt; where we talk about the latest news, releases, and insights on React and the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was part of the initial private React Hooks preview feedback group, and the invite-only-but-public React 18 Working Group, where we gave feedback on the design, docs, and usage aspects for both releases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m an administrator in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reactiflux.com&#34;&gt;the Reactiflux Discord&lt;/a&gt;, and have been the primary active moderator in &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/reactjs/&#34;&gt;the /r/reactjs subreddit&lt;/a&gt; for several years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve dug inside of React, the repo, and the internals, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26446&#34;&gt;submitting a PR that generated production sourcemaps for React builds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2023/10/presentations-react-devtools-replay/&#34;&gt;using time-travel debugging to integrate the React DevTools into Replay&#39;s DevTools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of listing those accomplishments is to establish that &lt;strong&gt;I have a long history and expertise around how React is developed, what&#39;s going on in the React community, what&#39;s happening &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the React team, and trying to help people learn React and Redux.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;biases-and-caveats&#34;&gt;Biases and Caveats&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since this is the Internet, I&#39;ll try to preempt some concerns folks might have with me writing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am most definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; always right, and I&#39;m definitely going to end up describing some things incorrectly due to limited knowledge, misunderstandings, or over-summarizing&lt;/strong&gt;. That said, &lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m writing this as a best-faith effort to describe history, motivations, and behaviors as honestly and accurately as I can&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;details class=&#34;detailed-explanation&#34;&gt;\n  &lt;summary&gt;&lt;h4&gt;More Detailed Biases and Caveats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I maintain Redux, that does bias my own opinions to how React gets used, as well as the kinds of problems I deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I&#39;ve used React in some form consistently since 2015, my own experiences using React have become more limited and more niche over time. Most of the React apps I&#39;ve worked on have been internal tools with limited distribution, and mostly &amp;quot;desktop-style apps in a browser&amp;quot; - in other words, true SPAs without even any routing or CRUD-type behavior. I did work on &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; CRUD/dashboard-style app, but it was limited in scope. I&#39;ve never built apps with huge audiences, never used SSR or RSCs in practice, never had to worry about i18n or other large-scaling concerns. I&#39;ve spent much of my time working on libraries and developer tools, and much less time in the day-to-day of &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; React app development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve read and been involved in inside-baseball React community discussions that the average React app dev never hears or cares about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had personal interactions with the React team online and in person that have been both very positive, and very negative and frustrating. These color my own perspectives. But, I&#39;ve also had enough discussions with other members of the community to have good confidence that many others share my concerns and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My normal writing style involves linking as many references and sources as possible. For this post I&#39;ll &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to do that, but a lot of these historical descriptions and observations will be difficult to find specific sources for, so please trust that I&#39;m doing my best to describe them accurately even if summarized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, with all those caveats stated, let&#39;s get going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-history-of-react&#34;&gt;A Brief History of React&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The early history is covered better in other places, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44&#34;&gt;the React Documentary&lt;/a&gt;, but to provide some context for the rest of this post:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;React was developed internally at Facebook around 2011-12, and open-sourced in 2013. It gathered a handful of external contributors, but &lt;strong&gt;until recently all actual development was done by the React core team inside of Facebook / Meta&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the core concepts of React have always stayed the same (components, props, state, data flow), the implementation details, public APIs, and breadth of scope have shifted over time. React went from creating components with &lt;code&gt;createClass&lt;/code&gt;, to ES6 &lt;code&gt;class MyComponent extends React.Component&lt;/code&gt;, to &lt;code&gt;function MyComponent()&lt;/code&gt;. React split from web-only to supporting mobile with React Native, then became customizable for other platforms such as WebGL (&lt;code&gt;react-three-fiber&lt;/code&gt;) and CLI (&lt;code&gt;ink&lt;/code&gt;) via a customizable &lt;code&gt;react-reconciler&lt;/code&gt; core. The internals were completely rewritten to a new &amp;quot;Fiber&amp;quot; architecture, unlocking further architectural changes. Function components gained the ability to have state and side effects with the release of hooks in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For years, &lt;strong&gt;React pitched itself as a minimal UI-focused rendering library&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;quot;the &#39;V&#39; in &#39;MVC&#39;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A JS library for building user interfaces&amp;quot;). Other frameworks like Angular or Ember were fully batteries included and had significant opinions about how to build and structure apps, but the React team left all of that up to the community. This led to a massive explosion in the ecosystem, both for better and worse. For any conceivable library category, there were dozens of competing tools solving overlapping problems: state management (Redux, Mobx, Zustand, ....), CSS and styles (Styled-Components, Emotion, CSS Modules, ....), data fetching (React Query, Apollo, SWR, RTK Query, ....), build tools (Babel, Webpack, ESBuild, Vite, Parcel, ....), and hundreds more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;React users have always had to begin a project by picking and choosing a set of libraries to solve the various use cases in their app. Additionally, React could be used in numerous ways: rendering every single element on the client side in a Single-Page App (SPA), rendering multiple subtrees attached to a server-rendered page, on the server as part of a Multi-Page App (MPA), and much more. The flexibility and variety of ecosystem options has been both a strength and a weakness. You &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; to choose the exact combination of tools you need for your project... but you also &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to choose a combination of tools. That leads to decision fatigue, variations in project codebases, and constant changes in what tools are commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;strong&gt;both the React library and the React team intentionally stayed unopinonated&lt;/strong&gt;. They didn&#39;t want to play favorites with specific tools in the ecosystem, their time and attention was focused on building React itself, and they still viewed the scope of React as being somewhat narrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That ecosystem variety provided flexibility, but also complexity. This was especially true with build tools. Early React tutorials often spent multiple pages at the start explaining &amp;quot;here&#39;s how to configure Webpack and Babel&amp;quot;, before you could even write your first React component. This led the React team to build a pre-packaged build tool configuration called Create React App. CRA was a CLI tool that could generate a new React project from a template, and built it with a a highly complex and customized Webpack + Babel config that was designed to make it simple to start a new project with a single command. That config was kept encapsulated as a black box, to hide the complexity out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;React never had a built-in method for data fetching, so it was standard to use third-party libraries to fetch and cache data. React did have server rendering (SSR) capabilities early on, with methods to render React component trees to HTML as strings or streams, but those had to be used manually in server handlers. Over time, other prepackaged React build systems and &amp;quot;frameworks&amp;quot; became popular. Next.js also wrapped Webpack, but added more features like built-in server rendering with filesystem routing conventions and page-based data fetching. Gatsby generated sites from GraphQL-based data sources. Later, Remix added server &amp;quot;data loaders&amp;quot; and pushed for more HTML/platform-based usage conventions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In late 2020, the React team announced a prototype for &amp;quot;React Server Components&amp;quot;, an architectural approach that allowed async React components to run on the server and fetch data, then render child components and pass the children and data to React running on the client. This was intended to be a React-idiomatic solution to data fetching, and marked a significant shift from React&#39;s original &amp;quot;just the view on the client&amp;quot; historical pitch. During the development of RSCs, some of the React core team members left Meta and joined Vercel, creators of Next.js. They continued building out the initial RSC implementation, and worked with the Next dev team to rearchitect Next with the new &amp;quot;App Router&amp;quot;, the first production implementation of RSCs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The React team also spent 2020-2023 completely rewriting the React docs site from scratch. The new React docs at &lt;a href=&#34;https://react.dev&#34;&gt;react.dev&lt;/a&gt; have a fantastic tutorial that walks through React&#39;s concepts step-by-step, with numerous in-page examples in runnable sandboxes, as well as much improved API reference pages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the new docs came out, the React team made a significant shift in how they recommended using React. Previously, the old React docs &lt;a href=&#34;https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#recommended-toolchains&#34;&gt;recommended starting with CRA if you were learning or building a client-side SPA&lt;/a&gt;, or pointed to a couple other frameworks like Next or Gatsby if you needed SSR or static sites. With the new docs, the React team changed their approach, and begin specifically and strongly recommending &amp;quot;you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; use a framework to write React apps - they have routing, data fetching, and build capabilities built in&amp;quot;. This also tied into the work to build RSCs. As part of this, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20250125034212/https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Start a New React Project&amp;quot; page&lt;/a&gt; specifically warned &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; using React without a framework. Next was listed prominently on that docs page - ordered first on the &amp;quot;Frameworks&amp;quot; list (for the Pages router), and then mentioned further down as the only available RSC implementation. React team members working at Vercel were quoted as saying &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/acdlite/status/1549853625673023488&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;I think of the upcoming Next.js release as the &#39;real&#39; React 18 release&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This tied into Create React App having effectively died around 2022. It had been unmaintained for some time prior. When a PR was filed recommending &amp;quot;mark CRA as deprecated and recommend Vite&amp;quot;, Dan Abramov wrote an detailed comment explaining &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741&#34;&gt;why CRA was created, problems with CRA, the rise of frameworks, and the shift of React&#39;s vision&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the React community collectively moved on from CRA, and the docs stopped recommending it, but nothing was done to officially mark it as &amp;quot;deprecated&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;react-s-relationship-with-its-owners&#34;&gt;React&#39;s Relationship with Its Owners&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, React&#39;s development work is sponsored and owned by two companies: Meta (formerly Facebook), and Vercel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;facebook-meta&#34;&gt;Facebook / Meta&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, React was a Facebook / Meta-owned project. The code was open-sourced, and anyone &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; submit a PR, but essentially all dev work was done by the React team at Meta.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This had significant impacts on how React was developed. React core team meetings were generally internal, as were any roadmaps. The React team would often prototype a half-dozen ideas for a problem space, then get app teams at Meta to try them out for vetting. By the time a new React feature was announced, it had gone through many internal iterations and been validated in actual usage. At the same time, the React team has also been responsible for supporting Meta&#39;s app teams with bug fixes and other support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the React team has had a fairly free hand in how they&#39;ve developed the library. While React was created inside Facebook for Facebook usage, the React team itself has decided their roadmap and long-term vision for how the library should work. For the most part, React&#39;s actual development process and roadmap has been driven themselves, rather than by other influences inside Facebook / Meta. That said, they also do have to justify their own performance and how projects benefit Meta.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meta&#39;s own use of React is both widespread and distinct from how the community uses it. Meta has its own massive server infrastructure, including standard techniques for data fetching, routing, security, and more. Meta invented the GraphQL protocol, as well as the Relay GraphQL client layer, and frequently uses those with their React code. This means that Meta&#39;s React use rarely needs third-party libraries for routing, state management, styling, or other problems common to the rest of the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;vercel-next-and-react&#34;&gt;Vercel, Next, and React&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vercel is primarily a hosting platform for web apps. They mostly make money by having more people host apps on their platform, and charge for the convenience of easier usage. They have put massive amounts of engineering time into building the Next.js framework (as well as supporting other frameworks), and making it trivial to set up and deploy Next apps on Vercel infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vercel&#39;s CEO, Guillermo Rauch, is a long-time believer in React and its capabilities, as shown by his 2015 blog post &lt;a href=&#34;https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui&#34;&gt;Pure UI&lt;/a&gt; that talks about the power of React&#39;s rendering model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, &lt;a href=&#34;https://vercel.com/blog/supporting-the-future-of-react&#34;&gt;React team lead Sebastian Markbage left Meta to join Vercel&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first instance of full-time React core team members working anywhere other than Meta. He was later joined by core team member Andrew Clark and former React org lead Tom Occhino. The React team had already done significant prototyping on RSC functionality in React internally. Seb helped design the Next.js App Router, and Vercel had additional engineers begin contributing to React&#39;s core and server rendering capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&#34;https://react.dev/community/team&#34;&gt;the React team is split between Meta and Vercel&lt;/a&gt; (with a majority still at Meta), plus a handful of team members or consistent contributors externally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;react-usage-patterns&#34;&gt;React Usage Patterns&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;standard-react-architectures&#34;&gt;Standard React Architectures&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The React (and ReactDOM in particular) library itself does not care how you use it within a page. You can serve a near-empty HTML placeholder and render a React tree that generates the entire page contents on the client side, as a Single-Page App (&amp;quot;SPA&amp;quot;). You can use React for server rendering (&amp;quot;SSR&amp;quot;), where the server dynamically responds to each request, or static site generation (&amp;quot;SSG&amp;quot;), where you pre-generate static HTML pages at build time. You can serve a static or server-rendered HTML page using any language or framework (Python + Django, Ruby + Rails, PHP + WordPress, .NET, etc), and sprinkle bits of React throughout the page to add interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, by 2015 React was most commonly used for client-side SPA app architectures. As with everything, these had tradeoffs. They made it easier to generate the page contents (it&#39;s all React components), had faster user interactions (show a different component on click or route change instead of a full page refresh), and enabled richer app experiences. It didn&#39;t matter what the backend was (JS, Java, PHP, .NET, Python) - just expose a JSON API and fetch data. However, they also were slower to load the initial page bundle, and client-side routing could lead to uncanny interactions vs native browser behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Data fetching on those clients was initially fairly manual, and required careful logic in side effects (such as triggering a fetch in &lt;code&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt; to request data when a component first rendered). This was often done with Redux-based logic to handle the fetching and caching, although that code was typically full of boilerplate and complexity. Later, purpose-built data fetching libraries like React Query, Apollo, SWR, and RTK Query greatly simplified data fetching on the client, providing purpose-built &lt;code&gt;useQuery&lt;/code&gt; hooks and prebuilt caching mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frameworks like Next and Remix provided standardized approaches to server-rendering React, with built-in filesystem routing conventions. However, there was no convention for server-based data fetching. Next invented a &lt;code&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/code&gt; mechanism to specify an async function for fetching alongside a component. Remix later invented &amp;quot;loaders&amp;quot; with a similar architecture. Neither of those &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; particularly native to React.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has led to a general mindset shift in the React ecosystem. There&#39;s more of a push for SSR-based architectures to improve page loading experiences and minimize the amount of JS needed for a page, as well as removing the need to use data fetching libraries on the client side. The React team has argued loudly against &amp;quot;waterfalls&amp;quot; in data fetching in order to improve page loading performance, and even client-side routers like React Router and TanStack Router offer ways to prefetch data at the route/page level rather than triggering fetches nested deep in the component tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;react-build-tool-usage&#34;&gt;React Build Tool Usage&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth looking at the download stats for several major React related build tools and frameworks to get a sense of usage scale in the ecosystem over time and today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Loosely put, today the major options for tools in terms of mindshare and/or downloads are&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org&#34;&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; (SSR / SSG / RSC / SPA)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://remix.run/&#34;&gt;Remix&lt;/a&gt; / React-Router v7 (SSR / SSG / SPA)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vite.dev/&#34;&gt;Vite&lt;/a&gt; (SPA)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://create-react-app.dev/&#34;&gt;Create React App&lt;/a&gt; (SPA)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also worth noting that Vite itself started off from the Vue ecosystem, but has become a standardized and widely used build tool with support for many different client-side frameworks. It also has a plugin ecosystem, including the plugin for React support, and has become the build tool of choice for various frameworks. That includes Remix / React-Router, which recently switched from using ESBuild internally to providing a Vite plugin to enable their SSR and SSG support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=react-dom&amp;amp;package=next&amp;amp;package=%40vitejs%2Fplugin-react&amp;amp;package=%40remix-run%2Freact&amp;amp;package=react-scripts&amp;amp;from=2018-01-01&amp;amp;to=2025-05-31&#34;&gt;a graph of NPM downloads for these tools over the last few years&lt;/a&gt;, with ReactDOM for scale:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2025-06-react-community-2025/react-frameworks-usage.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPM download stats&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the React docs also listed Gatsby as a recommended framework for web and Expo as the only recommended framework for React Native. Gatsby effectively died after being purchased by Netlify. Meanwhile, Astro is a more generic static-site-focused tool that supports many frameworks including React. Here&#39;s their download stats for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2025-06-react-community-2025/react-frameworks-usage-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPM download stats 2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few takeaways from those stats:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Next.js is most widely used&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vite&#39;s React plugin has grown steadily, and is now the second most widely used React-related build tool&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CRA usage peaked in mid-2023 and has been declining since, but still sees considerable usage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remix has strong word of mouth at this point, but is relatively smaller. React Router is very widely used, but the newer versions that support &amp;quot;framework mode&amp;quot; aren&#39;t as widely adopted yet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gatsby never had anywhere near as much traction as Next, CRA, or Vite, and Astro recently surpassed it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Astro is not React-specific, but has roughly the same downloads as Remix does&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vite + CRA together equal Next&#39;s usage, which shows that there&#39;s still a strong demand for plain SPA projects in the React ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;inside-react-server-components&#34;&gt;Inside React Server Components&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;react-server-component-development-and-vercel&#34;&gt;React Server Component Development and Vercel&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The React team had experience with server-based data fetching from Meta&#39;s infrastructure, as well as automatically splitting JS bundles and lazy-loading code. However, unlike previous React feature development, their options for iterating on and shipping RSCs inside of Meta were limited. Meta&#39;s existing server infra and technologies made it difficult to fully design RSCs in a way that the rest of the community could actually use and benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth noting that &lt;strong&gt;React Server Components were the &lt;em&gt;React&lt;/em&gt; team&#39;s vision for how to write React apps in the future&lt;/strong&gt;. As far as I know, this was not something that either Meta or Vercel came up with, or pushed the React team to build.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There had been intermittent discussion and complaints about &amp;quot;all of React&#39;s development is done by Meta employees&amp;quot; for years, and occasional comments of &amp;quot;it might be nice if there was a &#39;React Foundation&#39;, or folks outside Meta working directly on React&amp;quot;. While I don&#39;t know the actual discussions involved, from the outside my understanding is that &lt;strong&gt;the React team approached Vercel and pitched their vision of RSCs, and Vercel agreed to be the new proving ground as RSCs were developed&lt;/strong&gt;. This led to Sebastian Markbage (and later Andrew Clark) moving from Meta to Vercel, and the Next team spending huge amounts of time, money, and engineering effort to design and build the Next App Router as the first working implementation of RSCs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/1kg3yqh/rsc_for_astro_developers_overreacted/mr2bl62/&#34;&gt;Dan Abramov described it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Vercel team has allocated many full-time engineer/years to implementing the things the React team wanted. That’s not to speak of directly taking the technical direction from the React team. Next.js was more or less rewritten from scratch.\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe person designing Next.js now is the person who invented React Hooks. So if anything, &lt;strong&gt;it was more of a case of React team “taking over” the Next.js direction&lt;/strong&gt; rather than “favouring” it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; efforts made to get other frameworks and companies involved in that process. Shopify&#39;s Hydrogen framework did some very early testing and feedback of RSCs, but eventually concluded it wasn&#39;t a good fit for them. The Remix team was asked several times if they&#39;d like to be involved, but initially decided to focus on their own approaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, &lt;strong&gt;Next became the first (and effectively still the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;quot;production-ready&amp;quot; RSC implementation&lt;/strong&gt;. Today several other frameworks are working on RSC integration (including Parcel, React Router, and Waku), but Next&#39;s App Router is the only widespread option for using RSCs today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;rscs-frameworks-and-bundlers&#34;&gt;RSCs, Frameworks, and Bundlers&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I commonly see questions like &amp;quot;why do RSCs require a bundler or framework? Why can&#39;t they just be built into React?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;React&#39;s existing server-rendering methods like &lt;code&gt;renderToString&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;renderToPipeableStream&lt;/code&gt; could be called anywhere, such as an Express route handler. However, architecturally RSCs are much more complex. RSC functionality requires parsing code to look for the &lt;code&gt;&#39;use client&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;use server&#39;&lt;/code&gt; directives, then transforming that code to insert the appropriate calls to register Client Components and server functions with the RSC core functionality. That requires tight integration with a bundler, so that it can correctly determine the full module graph for both server and client and compile them appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the React core implements the actual RSC functionality, and provides primitives for sending serialized components and data between client and server, it&#39;s up to a framework to actually &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; and use those primitives in the right place. This is primarily about integration with a router, so that the client app receives the right lazy-loaded Client Components, and calls the right endpoints with actions and data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also means that every framework&#39;s use and implementation of RSCs will be different. Next made very specific implementation decisions with the App Router for handling layouts and routing. Other frameworks and build tools like Waku, Parcel, and React Router are already making some very different design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, RSCs are an unusual hybrid feature. The main functionality is built directly into the React core packages, but that functionality cannot be used until it is integrated into some kind of bundler/router/framework combination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;community-concerns-and-confusion&#34;&gt;Community Concerns and Confusion&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With all that history and context in mind, let&#39;s move on to answering (and hopefully clarifying or dispelling) several frequently repeated concerns that are either confused, FUD, or outright conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;concern-vercel-next-and-react&#34;&gt;Concern: Vercel, Next, and React&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s now an extremely common viewpoint that &amp;quot;Vercel is driving React development, with a goal of making more money hosting sites&amp;quot;. As an example, this is the highest-upvoted comment from a Reddit thread earlier this year:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Vercel has effectively taken over React and has a primary interest of pushing users to NextJS, deployed on Vercel, so Vercel shareholders get richer.&amp;quot;\n&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/react/comments/1iarj85/xbluesky_react_recently_feels_biased_against_vite/m9cb51h/&#34;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/react/comments/1iarj85/xbluesky_react_recently_feels_biased_against_vite/m9cb51h/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This ties into several other related points of concern:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Next is recommended first in the React docs, and the Next App Router is also mentioned as the main example under &amp;quot;Which features make up the React team’s full-stack architecture vision?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Next is still the only production implementation of RSCs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React team members have been quoted as saying that &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/acdlite/status/1549853625673023488&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;This Next release is the real React 18&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see how people might come to this conclusion. Vercel hired several React team members, who are working on both React itself and Next. Timeline-wise, this did naturally coincide with the development of RSCs, and the new shift towards pushing users to use a framework... and look, the &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot; framework is indeed Next! Meanwhile, Vercel has put massive amounts of money and effort into making Next easy to deploy and host on Vercel. It&#39;s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to host Next elsewhere, but there&#39;s always been features that didn&#39;t work or things were hard to configure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that said, from everything I&#39;ve seen, this take generally inverts the cause and effect, and is mostly FUD. Yes, of course Vercel has invested in efforts they think will end up making them money. But, per above, everything I&#39;ve seen describing Seb and Andrew going to Vercel and the development process of RSCs says that it was the &lt;em&gt;React team&lt;/em&gt; that drove this set of changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RSCs were the React team&#39;s vision. They couldn&#39;t effectively be prototyped and tested inside of Meta, so for the first time there was a need for some other sponsor to invest in the development and provide a setting to iterate on the design. I don&#39;t know the specifics of how it happened, but my understanding is that the React team convinced Vercel to buy into the React team&#39;s vision, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; let them drive rearchitecting Next to design the App Router approach that would match that vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There certainly has been &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; amount of &amp;quot;Next needs this&amp;quot;-type changes to React. I know I saw several PRs getting merged in the React repo the night before one of the NextConfs that had a significant Next version announcement (possibly the stable App Router in 13.4?). But, it was still the React team members doing that work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, the React team is split. The majority are still at Meta, but the members at Vercel are key to the core implementation. I&#39;ve read that &amp;quot;React team meetings are still the same as always&amp;quot;, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there&#39;s &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; additional complexity from splitting that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that said, I do think that &amp;quot;Vercel took over React&amp;quot; is wrong, and it&#39;s more like &amp;quot;part of React core migrated to Vercel and convinced Vercel to align with React&#39;s vision&amp;quot;. I also don&#39;t see evidence that &amp;quot;Vercel&amp;quot; is driving the design of React, or that the emphasis on frameworks and RSCs is with the specific intent to make Vercel money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;concern-react-only-works-with-next&#34;&gt;Concern: React Only Works with Next&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen multiple comments online with people saying, either seriously or wonderingly, that &amp;quot;React only works with Next now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is easily refuted. &lt;strong&gt;Even just looking at &lt;a href=&#34;https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project&#34;&gt;the &amp;quot;Start a New React Project&amp;quot; page&lt;/a&gt; shows other frameworks that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Next&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the somewhat infamous &amp;quot;Can I use React without a framework?&amp;quot; section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly this is a complete misunderstanding of how React works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;, it also says something about how confused the messaging around React, &amp;quot;use frameworks&amp;quot;, and Vercel&#39;s influence has become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll tack on the very related &amp;quot;Should I use Next or React?&amp;quot; question, which also pops up frequently. The literal reading is that &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;React&amp;quot; are different things. This is also clearly wrong. Next is a framework that &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; the React libraries. It&#39;s a superset, not a competitor. I assume that what most people &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; is &amp;quot;should I use Next, or a client-side SPA like CRA or Vite?&amp;quot;, but they don&#39;t have the vocabulary to state that clearly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, that shows how much confusion there is around the boundaries here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;concern-react-might-someday-stop-working-in-client-apps&#34;&gt;Concern: React Might Someday Stop Working in Client Apps&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen this one come up repeatedly too. The concern is that &amp;quot;if the React team is putting &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; much emphasis and work into features that require a server, does that mean that &lt;em&gt;someday&lt;/em&gt; the client-side functionality might change or go away?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people have this fear. It&#39;s driven by the huge shift in tone and emphasis from the React team, as well as the amount of effort they&#39;ve put into server-side functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it&#39;s also clearly impossible that this will ever happen. &lt;strong&gt;React&#39;s client rendering functionality &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; ever go away!&lt;/strong&gt; Just the fact that Meta itself has millions of lines of existing React code shows that. On top of that, the React team &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; always been extremely good about code-level backwards compatibility - describing breaking changes, keeping around deprecated features for years before finally removing them, providing migration guides and codemods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also worth noting that many of the features in React 19 and 19.1 are client-only. If anything, the community has over-estimated the amount of effort put into server-side functionality, and missed the amount of effort put into client-side features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;concern-why-is-react-pushing-frameworks&#34;&gt;Concern: Why Is React Pushing Frameworks?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that leads us to our next argument: &lt;strong&gt;why is the React team so dead-set on making all React users use frameworks, to the point of telling people they&#39;re doing it wrong otherwise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a concern that I have a lot more sympathy and agreement for. I just said that I don&#39;t think they&#39;re saying &amp;quot;use frameworks&amp;quot; with a goal of &amp;quot;get people using Next and hosting on Vercel&amp;quot;, so what&#39;s the reasoning?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 id=&#34;react-team-opinions-on-frameworks&#34;&gt;React Team Opinions on Frameworks&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew Clark&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/acdlite/status/1617667097424986114&#34;&gt;tweets from Jan 2023 state the intent pretty clearly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you use React, you should be using a React framework. If your existing app doesn&#39;t use a framework, you should incrementally migrate to one. If you&#39;re creating a new React project, you should use a framework from the beginning&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your React framework of choice should have built-in solutions for data fetching, routing, and server rendering. Frameworks don&#39;t treat these as independent concerns — they provide deeply integrated solutions that are easy to use and result in excellent performance out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you choose to forgo a framework, what you&#39;re really choosing is to build your own bespoke framework, one that&#39;s likely much worse than what you&#39;d get off the shelf. Even if you think your bespoke framework is better than the alternatives today, will that be true in a year?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes lots of time and energy to keep up with the state of the art. Are you ready to become a framework maintainer? Or are there better things you should be doing with your time?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing that has changed since then is that the frameworks got really, really good. It used to be that plain React + Webpack was as good or better than all-in-one frameworks. IMO, that&#39;s no longer true&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question isn&#39;t whether it&#39;s possible to build a React app without using a framework. You&#39;ll always have that option.\nThe question is whether your homegrown set up can compete with the industry leaders — on features, on performance, on DX.\nThe bar is constantly being raised.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in Dan Abramov&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741&#34;&gt;explanation of why they were considering CRA deprecated&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create React App solved only one side of the problem. It provided a good (at the time!) development experience, but it didn&#39;t impose enough structure to help you leverage the strong sides of the web for a good user experience. You could try to solve these problems yourself, but that would involve &amp;quot;ejecting&amp;quot; and significantly customizing your setup, which defeated the point of Create React App. Every truly efficient React setup was custom, different, and unachievable with Create React App.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These user experience problems are not specific to Create React App. They are not even specific to React. For example, apps created from the Vite homepage templates for Preact, Vue, Lit, and Svelte suffer from all of the same problems. These problems are inherent to purely client-side apps with no static site generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you build entire apps with React, being able to use SSG/SSR is important. The lack of support for them in Create React App is glaring. But it&#39;s not the only area where Create React App is behind&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;React itself is only a library. It does not dictate how to do routing or data fetching. Neither does Create React App. Unfortunately, this means that neither React alone nor Create React App, as originally designed, can solve these problems. As you can see, this isn&#39;t about a single missing feature. These features — server-side rendering and static generation, data fetching, bundling, and routing — are interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Times changed. Now it&#39;s getting increasingly difficult to recommend a solution where you are locked into not having these features. Even if you don&#39;t use all of them immediately, they should be available for you when you need them. You shouldn&#39;t have to migrate to a different template and restructure all of your code to take advantage of them. Similarly, not all data fetching or code splitting needs to be route-based. But it&#39;s a good default that should be available to most React apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also had conversations with the React team where they directly told me that they have heard many of the external complaints about React apps having bad loading times and overall poor performance. So, the frameworks emphasis is a direct response to that, with the goal of getting more apps to have decent performance by default.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on that, we can summarize the React team&#39;s stance as:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frameworks have built-in approaches for data fetching, routing, and server rendering, that are designed to work together&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Those are all provided out of the box, so you don&#39;t have to spend time picking and choosing pieces (that may not work well together)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frameworks lead to better performance by default, due to build setups and better data fetching patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Additionally, React Server Components &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; integration into a framework to work properly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Those concerns are critical to how the React team feels React &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be used today&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, it&#39;s a combination of an ideological stance, a belief that &amp;quot;this will save you time and effort&amp;quot;, and also a belief that &amp;quot;most React apps follow similar patterns and need similar solutions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 id=&#34;frameworks-ssr-and-spas&#34;&gt;Frameworks, SSR, and SPAs&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, note the specific mention of &amp;quot;server rendering&amp;quot;. In general, both the React team and other key members of the ecosystem (such as Ryan Florence and Michael Jackson of Remix / React Router) have put heavy emphasis on the need to do server rendering to avoid &amp;quot;waterfalls&amp;quot; of data fetching on the client (such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;List&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; fetching a set of items, rendering its children, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ListItem&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; doing its own fetch after mount, etc ). Frameworks like Next and Remix have been specifically designed to support server rendering out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The justifications for SSR around &amp;quot;faster initial page loads&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;less JS on the client&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;avoiding waterfalls&amp;quot; all make reasonable sense. I also agree that client-side SPAs have been used in a lot of places they probably shouldn&#39;t have been (same as with Redux, really), and that it can make sense to start with a framework even if you don&#39;t need &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the functionality right away, so that you can take advantage of those features when you decide you need them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll note that Next and Remix &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;SPA / export&amp;quot; modes&lt;/a&gt; that just output static JS/HTML assets, so it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to use them to create a purely client-side app with no Node server process needed. However, those are not the defaults, and I would assume most of the community is unaware that is even an option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 id=&#34;framework-push-lacks-nuance&#34;&gt;Framework Push Lacks Nuance&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given all that: I &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; why the React team has decided to recommend frameworks as a default. I think it&#39;s a reasonable opinion, and valid intentions to improve the average React app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I also feel that &lt;strong&gt;the &amp;quot;recommendation&amp;quot; has turned into an overly-broad prescription that doesn&#39;t give enough credit to the variety of ways React is used in practice throughout the ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s many good reasons to use a full-stack React framework, but also plenty of reasons &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frameworks add many additional features and functionality, but that&#39;s also added complexity to learn, making them less suitable for beginners that are just trying to get a handle on how to use React at all.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The added complexity can also be a trap that leads to confusion, such as accidentally using Context or hooks in Server Components (which throws errors)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many companies may not be running JS backends, and may even have rules and restrictions against that&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frameworks with server functionality do require specific hosting to run, whereas a pure SPA can be trivially hosted anywhere that serves static HTML and JS (including Github Pages and Amazon S3)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While the &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to pick and choose your libraries has often been a source of frustration for React users, it does enable customizing projects to meet your specific needs. Opinionated frameworks remove the need to make most of those decisions, but can also limit your ability to customize behavior later.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The emphasis on &amp;quot;server rendering&amp;quot; clearly helps &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kinds of apps, but not all - there are plenty of apps that only need to live on the client side.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 id=&#34;docs-recommendations-matter&#34;&gt;Docs Recommendations Matter&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The React team has said that &amp;quot;the docs are aimed at beginners&amp;quot;, so they want to keep the list of recommended tools and options fairly simple to avoid confusion. This is a very reasonable stance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&#39;ve &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; said that &amp;quot;anyone who&#39;s experienced enough to know to use Vite doesn&#39;t need to see it listed in the docs anyway&amp;quot; (paraphrased). That&#39;s &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it&#39;s not just beginners that read the docs, and what the docs recommend does have an influence as a stamp of official approval. That&#39;s a large part of why the React team had historically avoided recommending specific libraries or techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we refer back to the framework / build tool usage stats, today Vite React and CRA usage outweighs Next, and it&#39;s clear that SPA usage is still at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; half of the React ecosystem. The docs recommendations ought to reflect that usage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 id=&#34;dismissal-of-the-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Dismissal of the Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the new React docs came out, the only mention of non-framework options was an expandable details section labeled &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20230318003653/https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#can-i-use-react-without-a-framework&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Can I Use React Without A Framework?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, with several paragraphs saying &amp;quot;yes, but we don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And buried at the end of that section was this statement:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re still not convinced, or your app has unusual constraints not served well by these frameworks and you’d like to roll your own custom setup, we can’t stop you—go for it! Grab react and react-dom from npm, set up your custom build process with a bundler like Vite or Parcel, and add other tools as you need them for routing, static generation or server-side rendering, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, not only did the new setup page &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; list Create React App, but the closest equivalent tool (Vite) wasn&#39;t even listed as a meaningful option in the outer section of the page. Instead, it was buried as a mere mention at the bottom of this expandable explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d also say that the phrase &amp;quot;unusual constraints&amp;quot; is very poor here. SPAs had been the standard architecture in the React community since the beginning. CRA and Vite are commonly used. How is building an SPA suddenly an &amp;quot;unusual constraint&amp;quot;? There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; reasons to want an SPA, from architectural to business reasons to simplicity of learning. Those aren&#39;t &amp;quot;unusual&amp;quot; - those are all common use cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And beyond that... note the phrase &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;we can&#39;t stop you&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. That phrase stuck out to many people as poor phrasing that came across as dismissive of the community, and an indication that the React team was relegating SPAs as an unsupported approach, overnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example of this, here&#39;s a quote from a debate about the &amp;quot;frameworks&amp;quot; emphasis in the docs from mid-2023:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In some ways React is having its AngularJS moment. Teams are using this time of instability and uncertainty to shop around for alternatives. We certainly are.&lt;br /&gt;\nReact is great. It&#39;s the strong server &amp;amp; framework alignment tone change that&#39;s concerning to communities. The server-neutral aspects that made it what it is today suddenly feel second-class. (SPA routers &amp;amp; loaders are a mess &amp;amp; underserved!)&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&#39;s not about React or Vite. It&#39;s the ecosystem. It&#39;s painful to realize that React won&#39;t encourage the traditional &amp;quot;non-framework&amp;quot; as strongly as the &amp;quot;new ways&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;React without a framework&amp;quot; section is tucked away in the docs and depressing.&lt;br /&gt;\nAs a non-Node backend company we see those docs as a sign that we don&#39;t align with React&#39;s primary direction anymore. Framework endorsements are a big enough change to cause teams to reevaluate entire stacks. React is great, but its influence has limits on architecture.\nIt&#39;s not &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; for React to go this direction. But we can&#39;t pretend that non-Framework React usage is now a second-class concern. How long until it&#39;s not a viable option? It&#39;s uncomfortable. So, we look for safer bets. What would you recommend a non-node backend company do?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/vyrotek/status/1649097699696992256&#34;&gt;https://x.com/vyrotek/status/1649097699696992256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 id=&#34;fixing-the-docs-recommendations&#34;&gt;Fixing the Docs Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the React team finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app&#34;&gt;announced CRA as deprecated in early 2025&lt;/a&gt; (after I helped push them to fix it and make that deprecation official), the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/7495&#34;&gt;initial docs update&lt;/a&gt; included a new &amp;quot;Building Your Own Framework&amp;quot; page. The concept was that picking your own router and data fetching approach was equivalent to cobbling together a bespoke framework that wouldn&#39;t be as good as a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; framework.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand the mental model here, but this is also rather dismissive of both the way the ecosystem had been building apps, and of people&#39;s ability to choose their own options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example, Vite creator &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/youyuxi/status/1892000761778929931&#34;&gt;Evan You posted his take&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;it feels the React team&#39;s hesitance on Vite (and build tooling in general) is how it aligns with their vision of React (i.e. RSC being the recommended paradigm), and how much influence / connection they have with the said tools to make sure the integration works as they designed and can adapt to design iterations.\n...&lt;br /&gt;\nI apologize if this is not what the React team is thinking, but it’s my honest guess because I am just as puzzled as many React users by what took it so long for Vite to be better acknowledged as a recommended tool.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/7618&#34;&gt;filing a draft PR to revamp the setup pages&lt;/a&gt; to improve the tone, add nuance in recommending project setup tools, and offer some architectural guidance on choosing approaches. That PR got closed, but the React team did cherry-pick some of the ideas and phrasing over into a new PR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, they ended up with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20250526084038/https://react.dev/learn/build-a-react-app-from-scratch&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Building a React App from Scratch&amp;quot; setup page&lt;/a&gt; that is fairly reasonable. It recognizes SPAs and picking your own tools as a valid approach, lists Vite / Parcel / RSPack as suggested build tools, points to some routers and data fetching libraries, and provides some actual useful guidance to users trying to set up a project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s unfortunate that it took us multiple years to get the docs to that point :( Much of the confusion and angst could have been avoided if the React team had applied some of the community-recommended phrasing changes soon after the new docs were released.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;concern-server-component-docs-and-explanations&#34;&gt;Concern: Server Component Docs and Explanations&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the big pain points and sources of confusion around React Server Components is that official docs and info has been scattered and unfortunately lacking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The React team &lt;a href=&#34;https://react.dev/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components&#34;&gt;originally announced RSCs with an explanation video in Dec 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and that was followed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0188-server-components.md&#34;&gt;a lengthy and detailed RFC doc explaining RSCs&lt;/a&gt;. These did do a decent job of explaining the background and primary motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the development process of RSCs, combined with the fact that it&#39;s up to frameworks to implement design choices, meant that the actual React docs have never meaningfully documented RSCs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took almost 2 years for &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13&#34;&gt;Next 13.0&lt;/a&gt; to come out with the first official beta release of RSCs in the form of the new App Router, and another 6 months until &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4&#34;&gt;Next 13.4 officially declared the App Router as &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; and ready for production&lt;/a&gt; in May 2023. Vercel and Next have a small but very active devrel team, and by the time of Next 13.4&#39;s release, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20230502235021/https://beta.nextjs.org/docs&#34;&gt;they had done a sizeable rewrite of the Next docs to cover the then-new App Router, available as &amp;quot;beta&amp;quot; docs&lt;/a&gt;. That included some docs pages that talked about using RSCs, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20230422084216/https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/data-fetching/fundamentals&#34;&gt;under the &amp;quot;Data Fetching&amp;quot; category&lt;/a&gt;, as well as later detailed blog posts like &lt;a href=&#34;https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components&#34;&gt;Understanding React Server Components&lt;/a&gt;. These were excellent resources, with very helpful explanations of architecture and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, even though the RSC functionality was part of React itself, &lt;strong&gt;the React docs didn&#39;t have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; information on RSCs&lt;/strong&gt;. Not &amp;quot;What Are RSCs&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;How Do I Use an RSC&amp;quot;, and &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not &amp;quot;How Do I Integrate My Library With RSCs&amp;quot;. Vercel&#39;s team did a good job documenting their actual product and some of the overlap with React, but it was extremely confusing to people why there was no info or explanations about RSCs in the actual React docs themselves (which, timeline-wise, had just officially launched a couple months earlier).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s been lots of discussion from individual React team members on social media, responding to questions, arguing in favor of RSCs as a concept, and trying to flesh out sales pitches for RSCs. But as of today, the only official core docs page on RSCs is &lt;a href=&#34;https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components&#34;&gt;API Reference: Server Components&lt;/a&gt;. This page is, honestly, confusing and not particularly helpful. It&#39;s definitely not an &amp;quot;API reference&amp;quot; content-wise, and the content doesn&#39;t have any real context introducing RSCs or explaining when and how to use them - it&#39;s a grab bag of random topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been a number of excellent external blog posts explaining various aspects of RSCs:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dan Abramov has written &lt;a href=&#34;https://overreacted.io&#34;&gt;numerous fantastic posts explaining the mental model of RSCs and the problems they solve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vercel published a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Understanding React Server Components&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; intro blog post&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Daniel Saewitz wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://saewitz.com/server-components-give-you-optionality&#34;&gt;Server Components Give You Optionality&lt;/a&gt; explaining how they&#39;re an addition to your toolbox&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of information that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be in the React core docs - explanations of RSC concepts and why you might want to use them, independent of how any specific framework implemented RSCs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Related to this: the community has taken away the idea that &amp;quot;RSCs are the future of React&amp;quot;, and that &amp;quot;the React team &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; us to use RSCs all the time everywhere&amp;quot;. In reality, I&#39;ve seen React team members explicitly say on social media that &amp;quot;RSCs are optional, we just want people to understand them properly&amp;quot;. Given that confusion, it seems like making that point specifically in the docs is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&#39;d like to see an entire section on RSCs added to the React core docs, with pages like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Intro to RSCs&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mental model&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use cases / when to choose RSCs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Technical data flow / architecture&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Adoption / migration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;FAQ&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Framework implementor&#39;s guide&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having those docs pages would not make all the questions go away. Lots of people don&#39;t even read the docs in the first place :) But having those topics covered officially &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; make it visible, and it would act as a resource that could be used to answer these questions whenever they come up on social media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;takeaways-from-the-concerns&#34;&gt;Takeaways from the Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the React team&#39;s job to spend all their time dispelling FUD on the internet. Lots of people will have opinions, many of them will be differing or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, it&#39;s striking that there&#39;s a strongly consistent theme of &amp;quot;all of this emphasis on frameworks and servers is being forced on us to make Vercel money&amp;quot;. It&#39;s wrong, but there&#39;s enough circumstantial evidence to lead people to that belief, and the React team&#39;s actions and statements have to some extent reinforced that belief instead of disproving it. Unfortunately, at this point it seems to be a meme that is permanently embedded in the community, and I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to make it go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also genuinely concerning that users are worried or assuming potential problems with how React &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; change or stop working in the future, especially when those concerns are clearly wrong and easily disprovable. You can continue to use React exactly as you always have, and all of the RSC / server functionality is entirely additive and optional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internet being what it is, even a blog post on the actual React blog that explicitly refuted those statements wouldn&#39;t change a lot of people&#39;s minds. But it does feel like &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; some of the worst of that could have been avoided with better developer relations work from the React org - more time spent reading the concerns, acknowledging that they exist and understanding where they&#39;re coming from, and trying clarify and answer them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do feel that the push for &amp;quot;frameworks&amp;quot; has been genuinely well intentioned, but also too broad and ultimately dismissive of the variety of usage patterns in the ecosystem. Yes, it&#39;s hard to write docs and provide recommendations that offer nuance, and it&#39;s understandable to try to keep things simple to target beginners and nudge the ecosystem in a better direction... but part of being a maintainer is recognizing and supporting the variety of ways your tools are used by the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; finally end up with a reasonable set of React project setup docs that have useful instructions on setting up a project yourself and recognize that as a valid approach. It&#39;s unfortunate that it took us years to get to that point, and that the React team essentially ignored the very vocal feedback from the community on how to improve that section of the docs. The docs would still really benefit from more advice on how to approach choosing an appropriate tool and architecture for your app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the lack of official core docs info on RSC concepts and tradeoffs has contributed to the confusion. I strongly feel that covering those topics would be a huge improvement in people&#39;s understanding of RSCs and the resulting discourse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This hopefully answers a lot of questions about how and why React has developed the way it has, what the influences are on React&#39;s development process, the main goals of the React team, and where React usage patterns stand today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also hope I&#39;ve been able to dispel some of the confusion and FUD around the React team&#39;s motivations and reasons for pushing in specific directions. It&#39;s fine if people disagree with the technical directions, or decide that they don&#39;t need React Server Components or to migrate to a larger framework. But the React team&#39;s intentions are valid and genuine here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s really hard to maintain widely-used libraries and satisfy the variety of needs and usage patterns in the community. I do think the React team has done a good job overall. Unfortunately, the places where the communications have been poor and the issues with the docs have been a big contributing factor to a lot of the frustration and angst in the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I&#39;m hopeful that we can find ways to improve that communication, and maybe even get more of the community involved in improving the docs.&lt;/p&gt;",

    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thesis of this talk is that maintainers do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more than just write features and fix bugs, and that really most of what we do involves thinking about and interacting with the users of our library. That includes answering support questions, writing docs, thinking about how versioning and backwards compatibility will impact people, and a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this proves useful to other maintainers, and peels back the curtain on what it&#39;s like to maintain a widely-used library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;react-summit-us-2024&#34;&gt;React Summit US 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first did this talk at React Summit US in November 2024:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;maintaining-a-library-and-a-community-video-https-gitnation-com-contents-maintaining-a-library-and-a-community&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitnation.com/contents/maintaining-a-library-and-a-community&#34;&gt;Maintaining a Library and a Community - video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s the slides:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;maintaining-a-library-and-a-community-slides-presentations-2024-11-maintaining-community&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/2024-11-maintaining-community/&#34;&gt;Maintaining a Library and a Community - slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also got to participate in a panel discussion on &amp;quot;The Future of React&amp;quot;, with members of the React team and the community. This was a pretty good discussion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-future-of-react-panel-video-https-gitnation-com-contents-panel-discussion-future-of-react&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitnation.com/contents/panel-discussion-future-of-react&#34;&gt;The Future of React panel - video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;ndc-oslo-2025&#34;&gt;NDC Oslo 2025&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For NDC Oslo, I significantly expanded and updated the content and slides. Part of that is that I had an entire hour time slot instead of just 20 minutes, but also I thought of a lot more things to say :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;maintaining-a-library-and-a-community-slides-presentations-2025-05-maintaining-community&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/2025-05-maintaining-community/&#34;&gt;Maintaining a Library and a Community - slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video should be available online about a month after the conference, and I&#39;ll update this post once it&#39;s available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/live/42kUqbV3wIc?si=asXlCveJ_o660adX&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/live/42kUqbV3wIc?si=asXlCveJ_o660adX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work at &lt;a href=&#34;https://replay.io&#34;&gt;Replay.io&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#39;ve spent all of this year building some incredibly advanced React debugging features that make use of our time-traveling backend API. The biggest one is our React DevTools integration. Early in 2023, I wrote a post for the Replay.io blog on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.replay.io/how-we-rebuilt-react-devtools-with-replay-routines&#34;&gt;How We Rebuilt React DevTools with Replay Routines&lt;/a&gt;, which recapped the initial working version. I&#39;ve spent much of this year improving on that and building other related features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At React Advanced, I got to share details on how the React DevTools work internally, and dive into how we extract React DevTools component tree data from recorded React apps using a combination of custom Chrome modifications and backend post-processing &amp;quot;routines&amp;quot; that leverage our time-travel API. Along the way, I showed off some crazy tricks like serializing JS functions as strings, sourcemapping original component names from production apps, and generating sourcemaps for React itself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also got to participate in a group panel discussion about Open Source, including questions about how we got involved and what it&#39;s like to &amp;quot;compete&amp;quot; with other OSS projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve linked the livestream at the right timestamp for now, and will link the final video when it&#39;s live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-better-react-devtools-with-replay-time-travel-video-https-www-youtube-com-watch-v-jvv3huromu8-start-2896&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvV3HurOMu8&amp;amp;start=2896&#34;&gt;Building Better React DevTools with Replay Time Travel - video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s the slides:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-better-react-devtools-with-replay-time-travel-slides-presentations-2023-10-react-devtools-replay&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/2023-10-react-devtools-replay/&#34;&gt;Building Better React DevTools with Replay Time Travel - slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and the OSS Panel video:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;react-advanced-panel-open-source-video-https-www-youtube-com-watch-v-tuqy9cp38ue-t-8001s&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUqY9CP38uE&amp;amp;t=8001s&#34;&gt;React Advanced Panel: Open Source - video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;",

Similar to the Python 2-&amp;gt;3 transition, this has been incredibly difficult and painful to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a package maintainer, I want to make sure that my libraries are maximally compatible and usable in the widest array of environments I can feasibly support. Unfortunately, this also means that I&#39;ve had to become familiar with the nuances and behavior quirks of a variety of different build tools and runtime environments&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early this year I started working on trying to update the package formatting for the Redux family of libraries to give them &amp;quot;full ESM compatibility&amp;quot;. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;ve finally come up with a set of configurations that &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to work reasonably well, but it&#39;s been a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest frustrations is that there is no single authoritative and comprehensive guide on &amp;quot;How to Publish a JS Package Correctly&amp;quot;. I&#39;ve repeatedly begged for some expert who &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; knows what they&#39;re doing to write and publish such a guide. Ideally, it would cover things like what file formats to include, how to configure ESM/CJS interop and &lt;code&gt;package.exports&lt;/code&gt;, dealing with TS types versions, ensuring tree shaking, checking for compatibility issues, how to properly support specific build tools and what they look for, and so on. I have found &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; guides (which I&#39;ll link below), but nothing that quite matches the breadth and contents I&#39;ve been wishing for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that &amp;quot;authoritative guide&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s a recap of what I&#39;ve tried, and hard-earned lessons I&#39;ve learned along the way. Based on the number of times folks have popped up and said &amp;quot;you&#39;re doing this wrong&amp;quot;, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of pieces I&#39;m still missing :) But, &lt;strong&gt;I hope this information will be useful and informative even if it&#39;s not fully comprehensive and authoritative&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s plenty of articles out there already recapping the history of the ESM spec, the arguments and decisions that have led to the current confusion and compatibility issues, and how we got into this mess. In the interest of keeping this a somewhat manageable size, I&#39;ll try to dig up links to a few of those and list them at the end, and focus primarily on my own experience and steps throughout this process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;redux-packages-background&#34;&gt;Redux Packages Background&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;packages-and-configurations&#34;&gt;Packages and Configurations&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2022, I maintained and published these packages as part of the Redux org:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/browse/redux@4.2.1/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;redux@4.2.x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/browse/react-redux@8.0.7/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;react-redux@8.0.x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/browse/redux-thunk@2.4.2/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;redux-thunk@2.4.x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/browse/reselect@4.1.8/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;reselect@4.1.x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unpkg.com/browse/@reduxjs/toolkit@1.9.5/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@reduxjs/toolkit@1.9.x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each of these packages had their own development history, packaging setup, and build configuration. In general:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All the packages included ESM, CJS, and UMD build artifacts (with varying combinations of embedded &lt;code&gt;process.env.NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; values, or pre-compiled to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;development&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;production&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; versions)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All build artifacts used a &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; extension&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All the packages were being transpiled to ES5 syntax for IE11 compatibility&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;redux&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;react-redux&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;reselect&lt;/code&gt; were being transpiled with Babel and bundled with Rollup. RTK was built using a custom ESBuild wrapper script that did the bundling and primary transpilation, but also used &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; to lower ES2015 code to ES5.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All of the packages used the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;main&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;types&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; fields in &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;. None of the packages used the relatively new &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; field for defining which build artifacts get loaded.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Most of the packages except RTK output build artifacts to different folders by type: &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; for UMD, &lt;code&gt;lib&lt;/code&gt; for CJS, &lt;code&gt;es&lt;/code&gt; for ESM&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some examples from those &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; files:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;redux&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;4.2.1&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;main&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;lib/redux.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;unpkg&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/redux.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;es/redux.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;typings&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;files&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;dist&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lib&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;es&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;src&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;index.d.ts&amp;quot;]\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;react-redux&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;8.0.5&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;main&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./lib/index.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./es/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;unpkg&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/react-redux.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;es/index.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;files&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;dist&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lib&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;src&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;es&amp;quot;]\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;@reduxjs/toolkit&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1.9.5&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;main&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/index.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/redux-toolkit.esm.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;unpkg&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/redux-toolkit.umd.min.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;files&amp;quot;: [\n    &amp;quot;dist/**/*.js&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;dist/**/*.js.map&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;dist/**/*.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;dist/**/package.json&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;src/&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;query&amp;quot;\n  ]\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RTK&#39;s setup was more complicated, because it has 3 separate entry points: &lt;code&gt;@reduxjs/toolkit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@reduxjs/toolkit/query&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react&lt;/code&gt;. Note that RTK&#39;s &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; didn&#39;t list the two RTKQ entry points. Instead, there was an actual &lt;code&gt;/query&lt;/code&gt; folder in the published package, with &lt;code&gt;/query/package.json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/query/react/package.json&lt;/code&gt; files that in turn pointed over to the right artifacts in the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder. (This setup was the result of considerable experimentation, aka &amp;quot;it seems to work with Webpack and a couple other tools I think???&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While not directly relevant for the rest of the story, I&#39;d like to give a shout out to two highly useful tools that I use as part of the publishing process:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/release-it/release-it&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;release-it&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: automates the actual steps for publishing to NPM, including Git tagging and pushing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yalc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: lets you do a full local &amp;quot;publish&amp;quot; of a package so that you can test out installing it into example projects. Avoids issues with symlinks (ie &lt;code&gt;npm link&lt;/code&gt;), and tests out the real build and publish steps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;issue-history&#34;&gt;Issue History&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In mid-2021, we received an issue reporting that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/1396&#34;&gt;RTK could not be loaded properly in &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; client and server code simultaneously&lt;/a&gt;. In early 2022, a similar issue reported that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/1960&#34;&gt;RTK could not be correctly imported in a &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt; ESM file&lt;/a&gt;, due to use of &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; but no &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; field in &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, another issue noted that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/2485&#34;&gt;RTK didn&#39;t work with TypeScript&#39;s new &lt;code&gt;moduleResolution: &amp;quot;node16&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d previously asked around about the implications of adding &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to a package, and I&#39;d been told that &amp;quot;this qualifies as a breaking change&amp;quot;. That meant that I couldn&#39;t begin to consider doing it until the next major release for each of the packages. But, I had no idea when we&#39;d get around to publishing majors. Redux 4.0 came out all the way back in 2018, and RTK 1.0 in late 2019. React-Redux 8.0 was more recent, in mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Redux core had actually been converted to TS in 2019, but we&#39;d never shipped it. 4.x and its hand-written typedefs worked, and we had concerns about potential ecosystem churn from shipping a 5.0 major. We also had plenty of feature work to do with RTK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We shipped RTK 1.9 in November 2022. After taking a couple month break, I finally sat down to start seriously working on trying to modernize our packages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-attempts&#34;&gt;Early Attempts&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d been stockpiling a list of tabs and articles around &amp;quot;publishing modern JS&amp;quot;, ESM, and ESM/CJS interop for the last few years, &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; that this day would come eventually. (At last check, I had roughly 175 articles in that list!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reviewed several of those articles to figure out my initial steps. From what I read, I concluded that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to add &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; files, in order for Node and bundlers to detect the package as containing ESM files&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I also needed to add the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; key to &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, and add keys inside that listed the possible entry points and what build artifacts to use when imported in different environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d seen mentions of using &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt; as a file extension to force Node to recognize a given file as being an ES Module. To be honest, I felt that looked ugly and ridiculous, and I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to use that extension at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first attempt was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3095&#34;&gt;RTK PR #3095: Migrate the RTK package to be full ESM&lt;/a&gt;. Per my PR description, it contained these changes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This PR attempts to convert the RTK package from its existing &amp;quot;contains ESM and CJS modules, but not &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; ESM&amp;quot;, to be fully ESM with &lt;code&gt;{type: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;}&lt;/code&gt; and still support CJS:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKING&lt;/strong&gt;: Sets the main RTK &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file to be &lt;code&gt;{type: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKING&lt;/strong&gt;: Updates all entry point &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; files to use &lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt; to point to the types, ESM file, and CJS file\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I still have &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; in there because WHO KNOWS WHETHER THOSE STILL END UP GETTING USED BY SOME TOOLS OR NOT 🤷‍♂️&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Updates the build script:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fixed ESM compat on execution by replacing use of &lt;code&gt;__dirname&lt;/code&gt; and fixing the Terser import&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Switched all build targets to be &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;esnext&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, to ensure the output is untouched other than TS transpilation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moved all CJS build artifacts to be nested a level deeper in each entry point in a &lt;code&gt;./cjs/&lt;/code&gt; folder, ie, &lt;code&gt;./dist/query/cjs/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;{type: &amp;quot;commonjs&amp;quot;}&lt;/code&gt; package files to those folders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Turned off the UMD build artifacts for now&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The resulting &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;@reduxjs/toolkit&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2.0.0-alpha.1&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/redux-toolkit.modern.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;main&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/cjs/index.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;: {\n    &amp;quot;./package.json&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./package.json&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;import&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/redux-toolkit.modern.js&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/cjs/index.js&amp;quot;\n    },\n    &amp;quot;./query&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;import&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/rtk-query.modern.js&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/cjs/index.js&amp;quot;\n    },\n    &amp;quot;./query/react&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/react/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;import&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/react/rtk-query-react.modern.js&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/react/cjs/index.js&amp;quot;\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did try testing out local builds in Vite, CRA4/5, Next, and Node, as well as running the &lt;a href=&#34;https://publint.dev/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;publint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool. Things &lt;em&gt;seemed&lt;/em&gt; to mostly work locally, so I put up the PR to see what would happen with CI&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AND EVERYTHING EXPLODED!!!! 💣💣💣&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent a few more hours fiddling with things, and reported my findings:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well. The good news is I think the &lt;em&gt;runtime&lt;/em&gt; code works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad news is Jest is being a pain. In particular, something about the way it&#39;s importing &lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt; makes the default import an object like &lt;code&gt;{default}&lt;/code&gt;, which is not a middleware function, and thus the tests explode when we try to create a store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the last couple hours hacking around with the thunk exports and republishing it locally. Switching the thunk package over to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; having a default export at all sorta helped, but now something about the &amp;quot;no dev middleware in prod&amp;quot; test is failing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, close, but can&#39;t even build this branch yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;where I left off yesterday was that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt; has a default export, and Jest was now choking on that&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I published &lt;code&gt;redux-thunk@3.0.0-alpha&lt;/code&gt; that tried to convert &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; to ESM, but still had a default export included. That helped build with Next, but not our local Jest tests&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I then did a local-only publish of &lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt; that dropped the default export and only had named exports. That actually seemed to help, but one of our RTK tests that asserts &lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV=production&lt;/code&gt; behavior for &lt;code&gt;getDefaultMiddleware&lt;/code&gt; was breaking&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some folks in Reactiflux suggested that it might be worth investigating a switch to Vitest. I&#39;d prefer not to do that if possible, on the grounds that migrating to a different test runner is not my priority or something I want to spend time on. On the other hand, it could also be something that would be beneficial in general and for this specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;migrating-to-vitest&#34;&gt;Migrating to Vitest&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really didn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to burn time trying to migrate our entire test setup from Jest to Vitest. But, I&#39;d heard plenty of positive comments about Vitest, including that it ran significantly faster and had better ESM support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple days later I decided to give it a shot. To my pleasant surprise, the conversion was fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3102&#34;&gt;RTK PR #3102: Migrate RTK test suite from Jest to Vitest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main test setup made sense, and the &lt;code&gt;jest.fn()&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;vi.fn()&lt;/code&gt; swaps were straightforward. The biggest pain point I ran into was where we tried to mock the &lt;code&gt;redux&lt;/code&gt; package to assert that &lt;code&gt;configureStore&lt;/code&gt; was calling through to the core library. Had to do a bunch of fiddling with &lt;code&gt;vi.mock()&lt;/code&gt; until something finally seemed to work. On the other hand, timer behavior seemed to work more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As part of this process, I found myself also needing to convert other auxiliary files in the repo to ESM syntax, such as Jest config files and build scripts with a &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to get that PR passing, and merge it a couple days later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-alpha-testing&#34;&gt;Initial Alpha Testing&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I published &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.1&#34;&gt;@reduxjs/toolkit@2.0.0-alpha.1&lt;/a&gt; on January 21. This included the RTK packaging changes, as well as a similar change to &lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt;, and modernized the build artifacts to no longer transpile any JS syntax and drop IE11 compat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, this did not work as well as I&#39;d hoped :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mateusz Burzyński ( &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/andaristrake&#34;&gt;@andaristrake&lt;/a&gt; ) maintains several libraries, including Emotion and Preconstruct, and spends much of his time working on the TypeScript compiler for fun. He&#39;s an expert on many of the intricate nuances of packaging formatting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I announced &lt;code&gt;alpha.2&lt;/code&gt; on Twitter, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AndaristRake/status/1625781199724576768&#34;&gt;Mateusz replied with several suggestions for tweaks&lt;/a&gt; (looking at both RTK 2.0 and Redux core 5.0 alphas):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;no idea what &lt;code&gt;dist/es/redux.mjs&lt;/code&gt; is for now if it&#39;s not even in the exports map&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;by using the types condition like this TS might always assume that this is a module, even if loaded/required from CJS target~. Since you don&#39;t have a default export... that&#39;s &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; fine&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would include the module condition and point to the ./dist/es/index.js with it, this will allow the package to be only loaded once by bundlers, despite the consuming file&#39;s format (cjs vs esm)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;get rid of process.env.NODE_ENV in your dist files, use development/production conditions to accomplish this stuff (probably best to make production the default and the development stuff an opt-in)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saved those as an issue for reference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, we received a couple of new issue reports back-to-back complaining of problems with the config in &lt;code&gt;alpha.1/2&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3202&#34;&gt;RTK #3202: Cannot resolve types when moduleResolution is set to node16&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When importing anything from &lt;code&gt;@reduxjs/toolkit@2.0.0-alpha.2&lt;/code&gt;, typescript cannot resolve types when &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&#39;s&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;moduleResolution&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;node16&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;nodenext&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.\nI found that adding the extension &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; to the declaration imports resolved the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3208&#34;&gt;RTK #3208: Invalid exports config for CJS consumption w/ Node&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The current config in the Alpha does not allow for consumption of the CJS bundle in modern version of Node/any tool that follows Node&#39;s module resolution spec, as it uses &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; to refer to a CJS module despite the package setting &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is set, &lt;code&gt;.cjs&lt;/code&gt; is necessary in &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some bundlers do work around this and are more forgiving (whether or not that&#39;s a good thing is something else entirely), but this config will not work in Node and/or any environments that follow its resolution mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was... &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a happy camper:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I do honestly appreciate you filing the issue, but I am also legitimately getting angry at how messed up this whole situation is :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to do right by my users and support the variety of build tools and environments I expect they&#39;ll be using for their apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&#39;t do that if &lt;strong&gt;every single article and person is giving me contradictory instructions on what I&#39;m supposed to do :(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly this was going to take a lot of effort to figure out what was going on and catch possible errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;researching-better-configuration&#34;&gt;Researching Better Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right at the same time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1629161014812897282&#34;&gt;Devon Govett tweeted about improving Node+ESM support in a React-Aria package update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I replied noting I was working on some similar efforts, and tagged Mateusz. Shortly after that I saw the issues get filed, linked and griped about them, and Mateusz again suggested removing &lt;code&gt;type: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was feeling frustrated and begged him to publish a full blog post that would give details on his recommendations. Instead, he suggested we do a phone call and talk through things directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On February 27, Mateusz and I hopped onto a call along with Nathan Bierema (Redux DevTools maintainer). I saved the discussion notes in a gist:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/markerikson/42d55b0fd970449fc5d84263f4775cbd#file-rtk-esm-ts-notes-2023-02-27-md&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTK ESM/TS Discussion: Mateusz Burzyński&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mateusz threw out a lot of thoughts around how ESM and CJS &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get used, and questioned whether it even entirely makes sense to ship ESM at all. The information was useful in general, but it left me still feeling pretty confused about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in that Twitter discussion, I got in touch with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/atcb&#34;&gt;Andrew Branch (&lt;code&gt;@atcb&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, a TypeScript team member who had implemented the new &lt;code&gt;moduleResolution: &amp;quot;bundler&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; option for TS, and has been doing work on JS/TS ecosystem module behavior as preparation for writing. We set up a call on February 28.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/markerikson/42d55b0fd970449fc5d84263f4775cbd#file-tk-esm-ts-notes-2023-02-28-md&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTK ESM/TS Discussion: Andrew Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew gave me a rundown of how ESM works, how TS treats ESM and module import paths, and how Node and other tools determine if a file is actually ESM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR of that last part is roughly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you add &lt;code&gt;type: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, every file with a &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; extension gets interpreted as ESM, period. &lt;code&gt;.cjs&lt;/code&gt; files will be interpreted as CommonJS.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alternately, if you &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;code&gt;type: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; files are treated as CommonJS. You can use &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt; to mark individual files as ESM.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was also some discussion of whether or not we should be pre-bundling our TS typedefs or leaving them as individual &lt;code&gt;someSourceFile.d.ts&lt;/code&gt; files in the published package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-ci-checks-for-packaging&#34;&gt;Setting Up CI Checks for Packaging&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-ci-setup&#34;&gt;Initial CI Setup&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d suspected for a long time that I was going to end up needing to put together some kind of battery of example applications, each using different build tooling, to catch possible errors in packaging during PR CI checks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;code&gt;alpha.2&lt;/code&gt; issue reports, I reluctantly concluded I really needed to spend time setting up those CI checks before I did any more work on the actual package configurations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As part of my initial testing, I had locally created a small example app that exercised all of RTK&#39;s entry points. It had a counter to exercise &lt;code&gt;configureStore&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;createSlice&lt;/code&gt; from the core, a UI-agnostic RTKQ &lt;code&gt;createApi&lt;/code&gt; endpoint, and a React-specific RTKQ &lt;code&gt;createApi&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. I&#39;d pasted that into several different project setups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We already had our CI set up to pre-build a tarball containing the package contents from the current PR, and were using that to run our unit tests against the PR package version instead of our source code. I decided to try expanding on that to test these different apps against that PR build as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I copied the first couple example projects into a new &lt;code&gt;$REPO/examples/publish-ci/&lt;/code&gt; folder, and updated the GH Action workflow to matrix the folder names inside of &lt;code&gt;/publish-ci/&lt;/code&gt;, install the PR build into each example, then build+test it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3213&#34;&gt;RTK PR #3213: Test published artifacts in CI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a small Playwright test that would check the page contents to verify it could change the counter, and that both API endpoints had fetched the right mock data, in order to ensure that the apps actually &lt;em&gt;ran&lt;/em&gt; correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually targeted the PR against 1.9.x on our &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch, to see how things worked with the existing package setup first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually ended up with example apps that covered:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CRA 4 (with Webpack 4)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CRA 5 (with Webpack 5)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Next.js (with Webpack 5)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vite 4&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Node in both CJS and ESM modes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3365&#34;&gt;plenty of other build tool combinations that probably ought to be checked&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a good start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-the-types-wrong&#34;&gt;Are The Types Wrong?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in this process, I had discovered that Andrew Branch had created a tool called &lt;a href=&#34;https://arethetypeswrong.github.io&#34;&gt;Are The Types Wrong&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a website that lets you pick a published NPM package version, or upload a &lt;code&gt;.tgz&lt;/code&gt; file, and analyzes the package exports to report how TypeScript interprets the configuration and whether the JS files and TS typedefs match up correctly. It then shows all your detected entry points, and reports details on any mismatches and errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example of the report for RTK &lt;code&gt;2.0.0-alpha.2&lt;/code&gt; ( &lt;a href=&#34;https://arethetypeswrong.github.io&#34;&gt;https://arethetypeswrong.github.io&lt;/a&gt; ):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2023-06-esm-modernization/attw-rtk-2.0-alpha.2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Are The Types Wrong - RTK 2.0-alpha.2 results&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see that it detected all of RTK&#39;s entry points, and that most of the entry point + &lt;code&gt;moduleResolution&lt;/code&gt; combinations look okay. But, &lt;code&gt;moduleResolution: &amp;quot;node16&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; + some CJS environment apparently has multiple issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to use this analysis in RTK&#39;s CI to help verify that any future PR changes would actually work correctly. I looked at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io&#34;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;attw&lt;/code&gt; repo&lt;/a&gt;, and noted that Andrew had split it into &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;website&lt;/code&gt; packages. But, the core logic wasn&#39;t yet published as a package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I initially tried setting up a CI task that would clone the &lt;code&gt;attw&lt;/code&gt; repo, and let me write a command-line script that would import the core logic and analyze the PR build artifact. That technically worked, but fortunately I was able to convince Andrew to publish the logic as an actual &lt;code&gt;@arethetypeswrong/core&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, I put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/blob/f31ff77ad01f6cdbdbbd4a701718ac8445e34b91/examples/publish-ci/are-the-types-wrong/main.tsx&#34;&gt;a CLI script that ran the core &lt;code&gt;attw&lt;/code&gt; logic, collected the reports, and wrote it out as a console table&lt;/a&gt; to match the display on the website. I did this using the &lt;code&gt;ink&lt;/code&gt; React CLI renderer (and probably spent a bit too much time fiddling with rendering tables in the console). The results ended up pretty good:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2023-06-esm-modernization/attw-cli.png&#34; alt=&#34;Are The Types Wrong CLI output&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then configured RTK&#39;s CI to call that as another check alongside building the example apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/issues/15&#34;&gt;an existing thread asking for &lt;code&gt;attw&lt;/code&gt; to add a CLI&lt;/a&gt;, so I offered mine up as a potential starting point. (Someone else &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/pull/26&#34;&gt;later filed a PR to add a CLI&lt;/a&gt;. That CLI has now been &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/tree/main/packages/cli&#34;&gt;published officially&lt;/a&gt;, and I need to get around to switching over to using that in CI instead of my homegrown script.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;packaging-updates-round-2&#34;&gt;Packaging Updates, Round 2&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided it was best to try updating the smaller packages that RTK depends on first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d already had to publish a &lt;code&gt;3.0-alpha.0&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt; to alter its behavior. I decided I&#39;d switch over and try making further updates with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;switching-build-tooling&#34;&gt;Switching Build Tooling&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt; is a single tiny source file about 20 lines long (plus some additional TS types). That made it a good starting point to mess with changing packaging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noted that it was still using Babel+Rollup for the build step. I decided I&#39;d try using ESBuild instead. But, how should I use that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We already had a custom ESBuild wrapper script over in RTK. I briefly considered copy-pasting that over to the &lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt; repo, but decided it would be overkill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d done some previous searching for other ESBuild wrappers. I did some more looking and decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/egoist/tsup&#34;&gt;https://github.com/egoist/tsup&lt;/a&gt; a shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tsup&lt;/code&gt; actually worked out pretty well! In a couple hours I had a simple &lt;code&gt;tsup.config.ts&lt;/code&gt; file that generated the two artifacts I wanted. In this case the thunk code had no dev/prod conditional checks, so I kept it really simple - just a single ESM and CJS file apiece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also removed &lt;code&gt;type: &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and switched to using &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.cjs&lt;/code&gt; for the artifacts to force ESM or CJS appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I updated the thunk &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file to use those:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;redux-thunk&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;3.0.0-alpha.1&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;main&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/cjs/index.cjs&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/index.mjs&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;: {\n    &amp;quot;./package.json&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./package.json&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;import&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/index.mjs&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/cjs/index.cjs&amp;quot;\n    },\n    &amp;quot;./extend-redux&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./extend-redux.d.ts&amp;quot;\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I ended up doing all the same Jest-&amp;gt;Vitest conversion as the RTK repo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;umd-build-artifact-changes&#34;&gt;UMD Build Artifact Changes&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also spent a bunch of time debating whether it was worth keeping UMD files or not. &lt;code&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; shipped with a UMD bundle, primarily for use as a script tag (which I assumed was mostly being done in CodePens or similar examples).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;repeatedly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1411777215042363396&#34;&gt;asked about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1619467229258727424&#34;&gt;whether to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1614338592939163649&#34;&gt;keep publishing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1642561150339411968&#34;&gt;UMD builds&lt;/a&gt; over the last couple years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The closest I got to actual advice and answers were:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1411803139716665344&#34;&gt;Fred K Schott&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;HTML examples and code editors aren&#39;t even reasons to use UMD anymore, on their own. Ex: @CodePen ships with a built-in Skypack integration&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/marvinhagemeist/status/1642573135701504002&#34;&gt;Marvin Hagemeister&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;I think it&#39;s fine to skip UMD. All bundlers can consume ESM, and with sites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://esm.sh&#34;&gt;https://esm.sh&lt;/a&gt; that can be easily used in the browser.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I decided it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1642570701772058624&#34;&gt;finally time to drop UMD builds from the Redux packages&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I decided the best replacement for UMD was to include another ESM-format build artifact that was pre-compiled to production mode and no longer had &lt;code&gt;process.env.NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; references, so that it could be safely loaded in a browser. That way people could use it as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and load it from the package as hosted by Unpkg or a similar CDN.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I asked for feedback on use cases for keeping UMD as part of our alpha/beta release notes and have not yet received a single comment... but we all know that almost no one gives feedback on pre-release versions anyway 🤷‍♂️)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;webpack-4-compat&#34;&gt;Webpack 4 Compat&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In early March, I saw a tweet from Dominik Dorfmeister (maintainer of React Query) noting that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1632854140320710656&#34;&gt;Webpack 4 still has more downloads than Webpack 5&lt;/a&gt;. This is mostly due to existing projects that use Webpack internally, such as CRA 4, Storybook 6, Expo&#39;s web target, etc, as well as general ecosystem usage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9509&#34;&gt;Webpack 4 does not support the package &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; field&lt;/a&gt;, and it also &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/10227&#34;&gt;cannot properly parse code with optional chaining syntax&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, I also figured out that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3318#issuecomment-1493645057&#34;&gt;it doesn&#39;t like having a &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;main&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; field&lt;/a&gt; either, and needs a &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; extension instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of my goal for these major versions was to stop transpiling away &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of our JS syntax, only transpile TS types, and only ship fully modern JS. However, I also care about giving our users a good out-of-the-box experience. It was clear that trying to only ship modernized code would cause problems for anyone still on Webpack 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grudgingly decided that I would include an additional artifact specifically for Webpack 4 compat: ESM module format, transpiled to ES2017 syntax, and using a &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; extension, and point to that in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;main&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;immer-10-beta&#34;&gt;Immer 10 Beta&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Michel Weststrate, author of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://immerjs.github.io/immer/&#34;&gt;Immer immutable update library&lt;/a&gt;, had said back in January that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/1015#issuecomment-1404860676&#34;&gt;he planned to work on Immer 10 in the spring&lt;/a&gt;. The major planned updates were around performance and dropping legacy ES5 compat. But, Immer also had some similar packaging issues, including use of both default and named exports. Immer had shipped the addition of &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/937&#34;&gt;a 9.x patch release&lt;/a&gt;, only for it to break many users. The change was tweaked and half-reverted immediately, leaving Immer with an odd package config.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d left a comment in January noting &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/937#issuecomment-1386385087&#34;&gt;how I&#39;d run into issues with packages having both default and named exports&lt;/a&gt;, so Michel opted to drop the default export in 10.0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once Immer 10 came out in beta, I updated the RTK 2.0 branch to depend on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;typescript-declarations&#34;&gt;TypeScript Declarations&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Redux 4.x ships with a hand-written TS typedefs file. RTK 1.x has individual TS typedefs files per-source-file, generated from sources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tsup&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;dts: true&lt;/code&gt; option that will call &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; to generate typedefs, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bundle them together into a single file. That worked fine for Redux, but I ran into some kind of issue doing that for RTK. I eventually settled for sticking with individual per-source typedefs files in RTK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I had package configurations that passed the &lt;code&gt;are-the-types-wrong&lt;/code&gt; checks, with one exception: a &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;FalseCJS&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; warning for the ESM artifacts in &lt;code&gt;moduleResolution: &amp;quot;node16&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had some back-and-forth with Andrew Branch about this. The problem is that technically you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have separate TS typedefs for &amp;quot;my artifacts in CJS mode&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;my artifacts in ESM mode&amp;quot;, because &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/blob/main/docs/problems/FalseCJS.md&#34;&gt;there can be actual differences in what&#39;s exported and how that gets accessed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The approach Andrew recommends to fix this is to actually compile your project with &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, with two different TS module settings, and ship two different sets of typedefs with &lt;code&gt;.d.mts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.d.ts&lt;/code&gt; extensions to match your &lt;code&gt;.mjs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.cjs/js&lt;/code&gt; artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no build tool that I knew of at that time did this by default, and the idea of shipping 99%-duplicate typedefs bothered me. So, I opted to not try to fix this &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;FalseCJS&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; issue for our packages (at least for the time being).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew Branch later filed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/egoist/tsup/pull/934&#34;&gt;a PR for &lt;code&gt;tsup&lt;/code&gt; that tries to actually output one typedefs file per output format&lt;/a&gt;. As of writing this post, I have not yet actually tried this out myself, but I&#39;ll give it a shot later and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that Andrew currently has &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/andrewbranch/79f872a8b9f0507c9c5f2641cfb3efa6&#34;&gt;a very long gist with his WIP comprehensive documentation on how TS interprets module formats&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arethetypeswrong/arethetypeswrong.github.io/tree/main/docs/problems&#34;&gt;articles in the &lt;code&gt;are-the-types-wrong&lt;/code&gt; repo documenting all of the issues it can find&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;round-2-results&#34;&gt;Round 2 Results&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I published both &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha.4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;redux@5.0.0-alpha.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.4&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@reduxjs/toolkit@2.0.0-alpha.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in early April, with a set of package configurations that I was &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; sure should actually be &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up with these configurations:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;main&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/cjs/redux.cjs&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/redux.mjs&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/redux.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;: {\n    &amp;quot;./package.json&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./package.json&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/redux.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;import&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/redux.mjs&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/cjs/redux.cjs&amp;quot;\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux Toolkit:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;module&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/redux-toolkit.legacy-esm.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;main&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/cjs/index.js&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dist/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;: {\n    &amp;quot;./package.json&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./package.json&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;import&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/redux-toolkit.modern.mjs&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/cjs/index.js&amp;quot;\n    },\n    &amp;quot;./query&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;import&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/rtk-query.modern.mjs&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/cjs/index.js&amp;quot;\n    },\n    &amp;quot;./query/react&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/react/index.d.ts&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;import&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/react/rtk-query-react.modern.mjs&amp;quot;,\n      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./dist/query/react/cjs/index.js&amp;quot;\n    }\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also included the browser-focused ESM artifacts as well, although they aren&#39;t explicitly listed in there. (I may try to bring them back under the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;browser&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;unpkg&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; keys - will need to do more research there.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also kept the nested entry point &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; files in the RTK package as part of the Webpack 4 compat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These configurations seem to build and run in all of the sample projects I had configured, although that didn&#39;t include a React Native project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-package-updates&#34;&gt;Other Package Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I later applied the same package updates to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha.0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;reselect@5.0.0-alpha.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t originally planning to do a major version release for React-Redux. However, after seeing some other potential breaking changes, I concluded it was worth &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/2026&#34;&gt;doing a React-Redux v9.0 major&lt;/a&gt; to include the packaging updates, handle TS types changes from Redux 5, and stop using the React 18 &lt;code&gt;useSyncExternalStore&lt;/code&gt; shim by default.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/2038&#34;&gt;a PR open to update React-Redux&#39;s packaging&lt;/a&gt;, but had run into some TS issues and didn&#39;t get back to trying to fix those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;updating-immer-s-packaging&#34;&gt;Updating Immer&#39;s Packaging&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did some perf checks on Immer 10 beta, and saw that it was significantly faster. However, I also noted that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immerjs/immer/pull/1028#issuecomment-1494549956&#34;&gt;somehow Immer 10 beta seemed &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; than Immer 9&lt;/a&gt;. I pulled down &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immerjs/immer/pull/1028&#34;&gt;the Immer 10 beta PR branch&lt;/a&gt; and ran some build size comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After discussion, a part of the increase was due to Immer&#39;s &lt;code&gt;Map/Set&lt;/code&gt; support now being enabled by default, and Michel agreed to revert that since Redux doesn&#39;t need it and RTK is one of the biggest users of Immer. However, even with that change, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immerjs/immer/pull/1028#issuecomment-1499767135&#34;&gt;Immer 10 beta was still bigger than Immer 9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immerjs/immer/pull/1028#issuecomment-1499805247&#34;&gt;dug into Immer&#39;s build system&lt;/a&gt;, and found out that it was still using the mostly-dead &lt;code&gt;tsdx&lt;/code&gt; build tooling package and targeting ES6 syntax. This was adding a bunch of polyfills and dead code. I also found some issues with the sourcemaps and the listed bundles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&#39;d just spent a bunch of time updating the Redux and RTK build configs, I volunteered to port those changes over to Immer as well. I quickly put together a proof-of-concept, and saw noticeable reductions in Immer&#39;s bundle size. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immerjs/immer/pull/1032&#34;&gt;I put up a PR for those Immer changes&lt;/a&gt;, and Michel merged that as part of v10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;problems-with-next-js-and-react-server-components&#34;&gt;Problems with Next.js and React Server Components&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In early May, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4&#34;&gt;Next 13.4 was released&lt;/a&gt;. The headline feature was that the new &amp;quot;App Router&amp;quot;, which is based on React Server components, was now considered stable and ready for production. As part of that, Next&#39;s CLI defaulted to creating new projects with the App Router and &lt;code&gt;/app&lt;/code&gt; folder enabled out of the box, and the docs were updated to teach use of the App Router and React Server Components as the default.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We soon began getting a stream of new issues filed against React-Redux and Redux Toolkit, complaining that React-Redux didn&#39;t work correctly. The main reports were errors being thrown because &lt;code&gt;React.createContext()&lt;/code&gt; was null or &lt;code&gt;useLayoutEffect&lt;/code&gt; not existing in an RSC environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my Redux co-maintainer &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/phry&#34;&gt;Lenz Weber-Tronic&lt;/a&gt;, who also works on Apollo Client for his day job, had spent the previous couple months doing research into how to use client-side state management and data fetching libraries with RSCs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One issue he&#39;d run into was how to use RTK Query&#39;s &lt;code&gt;createApi&lt;/code&gt;, which can generate React hooks, on both server and client, and he&#39;d &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/26460&#34;&gt;filed a React issue asking for suggestions on how to handle this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/pull/9&#34;&gt;a long RFC for how to integrate Apollo and Next 13&lt;/a&gt;, which later led to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/frontend/using-apollo-client-with-next-js-13-releasing-an-official-library-to-support-the-app-router/&#34;&gt;publishing an experimental Apollo + Next interop package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In mid-June, an Apollo user filed an issue reporting that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974&#34;&gt;Apollo broke with Next 13.4.6-canary.2&lt;/a&gt;. That was fixed shortly thereafter in another canary build, but the issue spawned a long and frustrated discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that thread, a Next dev reported that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974#issuecomment-1593076110&#34;&gt;Next was now finding the ESM artifact&lt;/a&gt;, could thus better analyze what was being imported, and the use of client code in server components was now being considered an error. They mentioned: &amp;quot;If apollo client is going have server components solution then it needs to have a separate &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;react-server&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; export condition that only contain the server only exports&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After reading that, I chimed in and noted that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974#issuecomment-1593344051&#34;&gt;RTK Query has a mixture of both UI-agnostic and React-hooks-based code, and users might want to use &lt;code&gt;createApi&lt;/code&gt; on both server and client&lt;/a&gt;. I also pointed out that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974#issuecomment-1593362951&#34;&gt;we pre-bundle RTK&#39;s artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, and I don&#39;t know how to further split those out just to satisfy these Next/RSC-imposed constraints.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seb Markbage, the React team&#39;s long-time lead architect (and now working on Next at Vercel), replied: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974#issuecomment-1594629572&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;The user of your api can still use the same api, as long as you publish an optimized version of the inner implementation that excludes the unnecessary code branches.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That led to a strongly worded debate. Lenz pointed out that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974#issuecomment-1594645646&#34;&gt;this was asking the entire ecosystem to make potentially breaking packaging changes&lt;/a&gt;, especially since &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974#issuecomment-1594680297&#34;&gt;many packages like Apollo still don&#39;t have an &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;exports&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; declaration&lt;/a&gt;. That seemed to be a surprise to Seb, who suggested &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974#issuecomment-1594746276&#34;&gt;an incredibly hacky workaround of &lt;code&gt;import * as React&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to fool their static analyzer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; frustrated reading this exchange, and replied: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/10974#issuecomment-1594894341&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I&#39;ve spent &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; trying to upgrade our packaging, and now you&#39;re telling me I have to do &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; work just to keep our code from breaking in RSC environments. This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; demoralizing.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The conversation in that particular thread died down, but also coincided with a whole bunch of debate threads about RSCs on Twitter and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, Lenz published an extensive post titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://phryneas.de/react-server-components-controversy&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My take on the current React &amp;amp; Server Components controversy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he noted that we think RSCs are a very useful technology, but:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s much harder for us to help our users, and they&#39;re filing a lot of new support issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s a lot more about React (and Next) we now have to understand&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s now &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder to maintain and publish a library that works with React&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It feels like there&#39;s been very poor communication from the React team about the status of RSCs and the &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; hook, and little discussion on how this will impact the ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also listed a number of possible APIs that would help libraries better deal with RSC environments and data fetching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lenz&#39;s post received &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/phry/status/1676691019994112004&#34;&gt;lots of strong positive feedback&lt;/a&gt; from folks agreeing with the list of issues and suggestions, and expressing sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We never really got any actual response from the React team around any of those API suggestions, or how to properly publish packages that cooperate with RSCs. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get some outreach from some folks in the React org who are trying to work on adding official docs around RSCs, and was able to pass on a lot of community feedback around RSCs, marketing, and usage concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Next docs did get a page covering &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#rendering-third-party-context-providers-in-server-components&#34;&gt;how to wrap third-party context providers with &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;use client&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although that feels like a bit of a band-aid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;venting&#34;&gt;Venting&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After spending so much time on these changes, I was getting fairly frustrated at the sheer number of things I was having to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1652021889307496448&#34;&gt;In late April, I tweeted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things I have to keep in mind when publishing a library in 2023:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build artifact formats (ESM, CJS, UMD)\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Matrixed with: dev/prod/NODE_ENV builds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bundled or individual .js per source&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt; setup&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Webpack 4 limits&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TS &lt;code&gt;moduleResolution&lt;/code&gt; options&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;User environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Behavior differences between bundlers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Node ESM/CJS modes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TS typedef output (bundled? individual? &lt;code&gt;.d.ts&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;.d.mts&lt;/code&gt;?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Edge runtimes?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And now React&#39;s new &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;use client&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and RSC constraints&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All of this for upstream deps too&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is getting utterly ridiculous :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how anyone is supposed to be able to keep up with all these possible configuration changes, edge cases, runtime environments, and conflicting constraints.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are no actual comprehensive guides on how to do this stuff. Everyone&#39;s cargo-culting from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m trying to do right by our users and publish packages that work in as many environments as reasonably possible, but this is incredibly frustrating to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s a miracle anything about this ecosystem works at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This struck a nerve. The tweet went pretty viral (for me), with dozens of retweets, quotes, and replies. It also got linked in &lt;a href=&#34;https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/637&#34;&gt;some newsletters&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, after I wrote my comment about &amp;quot;feeling demoralized&amp;quot; in response to RSC changes, I followed that up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1669733564378673152&#34;&gt;another tweet linking the discussion and venting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a library maintainer in the React ecosystem, I&#39;m getting pretty frustrated by the churn around React Server Components.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really starting to question whether the touted benefits are worth the pain being inflicted on lib maintainers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That tweet also spread pretty widely and got a lot of reactions as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days later, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1669808482915057664&#34;&gt;I had a follow-up thought&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I find it ironic that both of my recent tweets a/b frustrations dealing with JS ecosystem churn as a lib maintainer (package setup, RSCs) have gone viral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I normally try to stay positive and not gripe much publicly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess other folks feel or sympathize with those frustrations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one reply noted: &amp;quot;I think people know how patient and positive you are towards what you&#39;re doing and the ecosystem. If something makes you frustrated that means that something BIG isn&#39;t working right or it&#39;s wrong&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I usually like to write blog posts like this after some release is done, or some discussion has come to an end, when it feels like that story is complete and there&#39;s some concrete takeaways and answers to write about. It&#39;d be great if I could say &amp;quot;hey, RTK 2.0 is published, and it includes a set of packaging updates that I know are correct and work everywhere&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, that&#39;s not the case here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has been an extremely busy summer for me across work, Redux, and personal time, and I&#39;ve realized I&#39;m dealing with some burnout. But, also, I started this post at the beginning of June coming back from React Summit, and have just now gotten back to it a couple months later to get it wrapped up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-do-things-stand-today&#34;&gt;Where Do Things Stand Today?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the state of things as of today:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.0&#34;&gt;Redux Toolkit 2.0.0-beta.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta.0&#34;&gt;Redux 5.0.0-beta.0&lt;/a&gt; are live and available, with updated ESM/CJS packaging (and a lot of other feature changes and TS types updates)\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha.2&#34;&gt;Reselect 5.0.0-alpha.2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.3&#34;&gt;Redux-Thunk 3.0.0-alpha.3&lt;/a&gt; are out as well, with both packaging updates and other tweaks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/2038&#34;&gt;a WIP PR to update React-Redux&#39;s packaging for v9&lt;/a&gt;, but there&#39;s no alpha release yet with those changes\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lenz worked on several changes to React-Redux&#39;s use of Context to keep things from breaking with RSCs. The first changes went out in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v8.1.0&#34;&gt;v8.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, followed by later tweaks in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v8.1.1&#34;&gt;v8.1.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v8.1.2&#34;&gt;v8.1.2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The packages &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; pass the &lt;code&gt;are-the-types-wrong&lt;/code&gt; checks, but still exhibit the &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;FalseCJS&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; warning. Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arethetypeswrong.github.io/?p=%40reduxjs%2Ftoolkit%402.0.0-beta.0&#34;&gt;RTK 2.0 beta has some internal TS path usages that need to be cleaned up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Beyond the Context-related tweaks, we don&#39;t have any actual changes for better interop with RSCs, or plans to work on anyhting meaningful there&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-and-takeaways&#34;&gt;Lessons and Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve said many times that I still feel like I barely know anything about the topics of module packaging and publishing types. In practice, I&#39;d guess that I do actually know more than most JS devs, because I&#39;ve had to spend so much time trying to work on this (both over the years, and this year specifically). But, given the insane complexity, myriad of conflicting requirements, and rapidly changing list of things to keep track of, I think it&#39;s pretty understandable that I still feel like a clueless imposter about all of these topics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what have I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; learned?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have a set of package configurations that &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to work in most bundlers and build tools right now, and &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to have valid ESM/CJS packaging&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Publishing TS typedefs properly adds another level of complexity on top of that&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pre-bundling your JS build artifacts sidesteps potential issues around having to have &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;.js&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in file imports, and seems to work okay with tree-shaking...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;But then can lead to other problems when something like this &amp;quot;split out your client code for RSC scenarios&amp;quot; thing comes up&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s almost impossible to keep up with all the different tools and constraints that are out there, and they keep changing\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is no good full list of build tools and their quirks or constraints. There&#39;s &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; resources ( &lt;a href=&#34;https://sokra.github.io/interop-test/&#34;&gt;Sokra&#39;s interop table&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://reaper.is/writing/20220418-the-esm-cjs-problem&#34;&gt;this article with some bundler details&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VzemJcrAerkMyw17VZo3uAODbC4dmRUgbc2_jXuveCQ/edit#gid=0&#34;&gt;a spreadsheet from Jason Miller&lt;/a&gt;, etc), but there&#39;s no one-stop-shop to understand what you need to configure to make specific tools happy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Similarly, there just aren&#39;t enough official, comprehensive resources on publishing packages. I found &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; decent guides ( such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/frehner/modern-guide-to-packaging-js-library&#34;&gt;The Modern Guide to Packaging Your JS Library&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/advename/The-React-Library-guide&#34;&gt;The React Library Guide (draft)&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.dev/publish-modern-javascript/&#34;&gt;Publishing Modern JS&lt;/a&gt; ), but it still feels like so much of this knowledge is fragmented, scattered, and conflicting. There&#39;s especially a need for guidance on what package formats+artifacts you &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to be shipping to cover different kinds of usage scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ecosystem desperately needs better tooling to help automate this process.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tsup&lt;/code&gt; seems to be pretty good, and I&#39;ve seen some other tools that claim to help with shipping dual ESM/CJS packages that I haven&#39;t tried, but it just feels like so much of this could be automated.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Similarly, it feels like there&#39;s a need for some kind of &amp;quot;test-your-lib-against-a-range-of-build-tools As A Service&amp;quot; tool. I set up a bunch of sample Redux projects with a variety of build tools, and I saw &lt;code&gt;react-aria&lt;/code&gt; did something similar, but this feels like the kind of setup that could be commoditized somehow and help lib authors verify that their packages work correctly across the ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React Server Components are a useful concept and tool, but it sure feels like this is a major disruption that&#39;s going to break a lot of the ecosystem. I understand the React team&#39;s comments that &amp;quot;nothing about client React changes, this is all additive&amp;quot;... but at the same time it&#39;s a massive increase in mental overhead and use case complexity that both users and lib authors have to deal with.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s been effectively no outreach from the React team to the library ecosystem about how to deal with packages and RSCs. To be fair, we did have a call with Dan+Andrew, Dan reviewed Lenz&#39;s RFC, and there&#39;s been some discussion in issues. But there was no announcement or warning about Next throwing errors on client imports, no table of &amp;quot;what&#39;s in each canary version?&amp;quot; available, and no kind of &amp;quot;guidance to lib authors for RSC compat&amp;quot; post or doc published.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The overall ecosystem CJS/ESM transition has been a long and ongoing nightmare, and it shows no signs of ending any time soon. Just recently I saw a pair of dueling posts that argued &lt;a href=&#34;https://deno.com/blog/commonjs-is-hurting-javascript&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;CJS is hurting JavaScript&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bun.sh/blog/commonjs-is-not-going-away&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;CommonJS is not going away&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly this is a problem we&#39;re going to be stuck with for years.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;future-steps&#34;&gt;Future Steps&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We still need to finish up Redux Toolkit 2.0, but that&#39;s going to take a while. Just trying to make sure all the packages are fully up to date with the packaging changes, cross-reference each other&#39;s versions, and that all the TS types work, is time-consuming. We probably have more code-related changes to make too, but we don&#39;t have a solid list of what else &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be in this set of majors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all of us maintainers are dealing with trying to balance jobs, motivation, time, and real life, and that means Redux work is a lower priority for us right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been an exhausting year so far dealing with all these issues. We still intend to get out the set of major releases (eventually - absolutely no ETA promises here), and I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;hopeful&lt;/em&gt; that these new versions will be a benefit to the ecosystem and significantly improve compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I sure &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; that all this time and effort will have been worth it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-information&#34;&gt;Further Information&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ES Modules History and Specs&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/jkrems/769a8cd8806f7f57903b641c74b5f08a&#34;&gt;Gist: ES Modules - History and Future&lt;/a&gt;

    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to talk on a number of different podcasts and interviews over the course of the year. I&#39;ve gathered them here as a directory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;thisdot-tracy-lee-how-to-contribute-to-redux&#34;&gt;ThisDot / Tracy Lee: How to Contribute to Redux&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tracy Lee is a prolific podcaster, and her company ThisDot creates numerous shows related to the JS ecosystem. She had me on as part of a new &amp;quot;How to Contribute...&amp;quot; series, where I talked about ways to contribute to the Redux libraries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPJmnxDX9lY&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPJmnxDX9lY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;kevin-ghadyani-redux-vs-react-context&#34;&gt;Kevin Ghadyani: Redux vs React Context&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kevin and I have done a couple long-form video discussions in the last couple years, and he&#39;s split those out into several separate videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This discussion was actually recorded in mid-2021, but just recently got published.

We talked about the differences between Replay and &amp;quot;session recording&amp;quot; tools, the internals of how Replay works, and potential future use cases for time-travel debugging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://podrocket.logrocket.com/replay&#34;&gt;https://podrocket.logrocket.com/replay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;guild-community-tour-mark-erikson&#34;&gt;Guild Community Tour: Mark Erikson&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taz Singh does a lot of interviews with folks in the JS community to help share their stories. He interviewed several folks at the Reactathon conference this year, and we had a chance to sit down and chat. We made a bunch of jokes about my Simpsons avatar, and talked about my early dev career, my time teaching in China, how I got involved in Redux, what prompted some of my blog posts, and the magic of time travel debugging with Replay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.guild.host/presentations/episode-23-mark-erikson-bczaup&#34;&gt;https://beta.guild.host/presentations/episode-23-mark-erikson-bczaup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;peerlist-the-mindset-of-a-redux-maintainer&#34;&gt;Peerlist: The Mindset of a Redux Maintainer&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a meetup-type presentation of the &amp;quot;Modern Redux&amp;quot; talk I&#39;ve done a couple times, but there were also some good questions asked afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbREkTZCcpc&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbREkTZCcpc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;20-minute-js-redux-toolkit-and-state-management-in-react&#34;&gt;20 Minute JS: Redux Toolkit and State Management in React&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fernando Doglio had me on to discuss some of the basics around &amp;quot;state management&amp;quot;, why Redux became popular and then got a bad reputation, comparisons with other state libraries, and how we&#39;ve modernized it with Redux Toolkit&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://podcast.20minjs.com/1952066/10665172-episode-12-redux-toolkit-and-state-management-in-react-with-mark-erikson&#34;&gt;https://podcast.20minjs.com/1952066/10665172-episode-12-redux-toolkit-and-state-management-in-react-with-mark-erikson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;react-native-radio-a-redux-maintainer-s-thoughts-on-redux-toolkit-vs-mobx-state-tree&#34;&gt;React Native Radio: A Redux Maintainer&#39;s Thoughts on Redux Toolkit vs Mobx-State-Tree&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year the React Native Radio podcast hosts did a show on &lt;a href=&#34;https://reactnativeradio.com/episodes/rnr-241-redux-toolkit-vs-mobx-state-tree-showdown&#34;&gt;Redux Toolkit vs Mobx-State-Tree&lt;/a&gt;. It was actually a very fair and balanced discussion, with a bit of a twist because host Jamon Holmgren is the maintainer of MST.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After listening to that episode, I had some thoughts on some of the topics they discussed, and reached out to Jamon. They brought me on for a follow-up episode where we dove into some of the points they&#39;d brought up and I talked about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Redux is designed this way, including the purpose of immutability, pain points with selectors, and other tradeoffs. Really good discussion!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://reactnativeradio.com/episodes/rnr-249-a-redux-maintainers-thoughts-on-rtk-vs-mst&#34;&gt;https://reactnativeradio.com/episodes/rnr-249-a-redux-maintainers-thoughts-on-rtk-vs-mst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;merged-leading-tech-communities&#34;&gt;Merged: Leading Tech Communities&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iddan Aaronsohn had me on the &amp;quot;Merged&amp;quot; podcast to discuss a number of topics around my involvement in the tech community. We talked about dealing with social media, sharing knowledge, working with open source, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/episode/67jTvkMB2vf7AYD5d8KSEs?si=DmNMOIuOSjaheIRI09-G_A&amp;amp;nd=1&#34;&gt;https://open.spotify.com/episode/67jTvkMB2vf7AYD5d8KSEs?si=DmNMOIuOSjaheIRI09-G_A&amp;amp;nd=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;reactiflux-office-hours-lenz-weber-tronic-and-mark-erikson&#34;&gt;Reactiflux Office Hours: Lenz Weber-Tronic and Mark Erikson&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carl Vitullo, one of the other admins in the Reactiflux Discord, held an &amp;quot;office hours&amp;quot; interview with myself and my RTK co-maintainer Lenz Weber-Tronic. We chatted about how we got involved with Redux, how users depend on implicit behavior of libraries, complexities of maintaining TypeScript libraries, the job searches we went through this year, and ways that people can get involved with open source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/episode/1xKYFWjPmtYwNY3DauQ2JB?si=LOhGBIrDQ5KI3034b6xvBQ&#34;&gt;https://open.spotify.com/episode/1xKYFWjPmtYwNY3DauQ2JB?si=LOhGBIrDQ5KI3034b6xvBQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the last couple years, I&#39;ve thrown around the statements that &amp;quot;Redux is used by 45-50% of React apps&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Redux is by far the most widely used state management tool for React apps&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had a couple people ask how I&#39;m coming up with those numbers. I&#39;d written a couple prior comments about this - I tried to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/lcgqnd/state_management/glzrax4/&#34;&gt;estimate React &amp;quot;state management market share&amp;quot; in Feb 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/skbyb1/the_most_popular_react_tech_stack_in_professional/hvlwdpw/&#34;&gt;talked some about the flaws in NPM stats as a metric in Feb 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but figured it was worth putting into a blog post for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll go through the sources I use, discuss the &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; caveats and limitations with those sources, and then look at Redux and other state management libraries as an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;primary-source-npm-package-download-stats&#34;&gt;Primary Source: NPM Package Download Stats&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most obvious source, and the one that everyone including myself automatically turns to, is NPM&#39;s stats on how many times a package is downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That info is available through several different pages and aggregators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;npm-package-stats-sources&#34;&gt;NPM Package Stats Sources&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 id=&#34;npmjs-com&#34;&gt;NPMJS.com&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first is NPM&#39;s standard package description page. This shows a &amp;quot;downloads per week&amp;quot; graph in the right sidebar:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/npm-package-page.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPM package page&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until recently, there was no way to know how many times a given package version was being downloaded. Those weekly numbers count &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; versions of the package combined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, within the last year, NPM &lt;em&gt;fiiiinally&lt;/em&gt; started publishing download stats per version. The limitation is that the data is only provided for the last 7 days worth of downloads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those per-version numbers are available on the &amp;quot;Versions&amp;quot; tab for a package on the NPM site:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/npm-version-downloads.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPM version downloads&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happily, these per-version numbers are also available as an API, with a URL of &lt;code&gt;https://api.npmjs.org/versions/$PACKAGE_NAME/last-week&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://api.npmjs.org/versions/redux/last-week&#34;&gt;https://api.npmjs.org/versions/redux/last-week&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;{\n  &amp;quot;package&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;redux&amp;quot;,\n  &amp;quot;downloads&amp;quot;: {\n    &amp;quot;4.1.0-alpha.0&amp;quot;: 48,\n    &amp;quot;4.1.0&amp;quot;: 1603217,\n    &amp;quot;4.1.2&amp;quot;: 1869219,\n    &amp;quot;4.1.1&amp;quot;: 499937,\n    &amp;quot;5.0.0-alpha.0&amp;quot;: 220,\n    &amp;quot;4.2.0&amp;quot;: 2087907,\n    &amp;quot;4.0.0&amp;quot;: 114988\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Note: It would be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; neat if someone would create a tool that would start automatically scraping these per-version downloads stats and save them to allow comparisons over time...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4 id=&#34;npm-download-comparison-tools&#34;&gt;NPM Download Comparison Tools&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s several sites out there that let you type in a few different package names, and it will query NPM for download stats over time and graph them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My go-to site is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://npm-stat.com&#34;&gt;https://npm-stat.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It lets you enter up to 5 package names (although I wish it allowed more), and shows graphs for daily/weekly/monthly/yearly download trends. Here&#39;s an example weekly graph from a query for &lt;a href=&#34;https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=mobx&amp;amp;package=%40reduxjs%2Ftoolkit&amp;amp;package=react-query&amp;amp;from=2021-01-01&amp;amp;to=2022-06-30&#34;&gt;Redux Toolkit, Mobx, and React Query since 2021&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/npm-stat-weekly-graph.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPM-Stat weekly graph&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other available sites are &lt;a href=&#34;https://npmtrends.com&#34;&gt;https://npmtrends.com&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&#34;http://npm-stats.org/&#34;&gt;http://npm-stats.org/&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://npmcharts.com/&#34;&gt;https://npmcharts.com/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://moiva.io/&#34;&gt;https://moiva.io/&lt;/a&gt; , which lets you do some similar NPM download stat trend comparisons for selected libraries, and also shows a variety of other stats: month-over-month download growth, recent releases, number of contributors, Github stars, bundle sizes, and more. A typical comparison page looks like this: &lt;a href=&#34;https://moiva.io/?npm=@reduxjs/toolkit+mobx+react-query+redux+xstate&#34;&gt;https://moiva.io/?npm=@reduxjs/toolkit+mobx+react-query+redux+xstate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/moiva-graphs.png&#34; alt=&#34;Moiva comparisons and graphs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t actually used Moiva that much thus far, but looking at it again now there&#39;s a lot of good info here and I ought to refer to it more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;alternate-stat-sources&#34;&gt;Alternate Stat Sources&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a couple other actual stats sources I look at as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;github-dependency-lists&#34;&gt;Github Dependency Lists&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Github knows how to parse all the various package manager formats used in different language ecosystems, and uses that for many different features. One of those is the &amp;quot;Dependency Graph &amp;gt; Dependents&amp;quot; list, buried under the top &amp;quot;Insights&amp;quot; tab. It shows a count of how many repos and ecosystem packages depend on the package in this repo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/github-dep-graph.png&#34; alt=&#34;Github dependents list&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also Github stars. Frankly, I&#39;ve never bothered using them as a proxy for actual &lt;em&gt;usage&lt;/em&gt;, only vague popularity scales (&amp;quot;this just got posted&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a few people have looked at it&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;this is actually being used&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;this is widely used&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;this is a major player in the ecosystem&amp;quot;, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-polls-and-social-media-discussions&#34;&gt;Online Polls and Social Media Discussions&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other vaguely statistical values I refer to are the occasional &amp;quot;what tools are you using?&amp;quot; polls that pop up on Twitter or Reddit, and particularly in relation to state management libraries. These produce some actual numbers in the poll results, as well as associated discussion. A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1186980916213755904&#34;&gt;Twitter: Oct 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/poll/jzz8si&#34;&gt;Reddit: Nov 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/poll/sv0gnv&#34;&gt;Reddit: Feb 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TAbrodi/status/1495087372240928769&#34;&gt;Twitter: Feb 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashnode/status/1515638734133280770&#34;&gt;Twitter: Apr 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are a much less objective set of numbers, but looking at both the poll numbers and discussion can help give a sense of what&#39;s being used. On the other hand, polls are also inconsistent in which tools they even list in the first place, which makes them harder to compare to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it&#39;s not actual hard stats, I do get a sense of what people may be using or finding interesting from general chatter on social media: Twitter, Reddit, HN, Reactiflux, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;caveats-with-package-stats-and-sources&#34;&gt;Caveats with Package Stats and Sources&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Settle in, because there&#39;s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every single one of these metrics and sources is &lt;em&gt;horribly&lt;/em&gt; flawed in multiple ways!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;npm-download-stats-flaws&#34;&gt;NPM Download Stats Flaws&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s start with the biggest source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first issue is what&#39;s even triggering all these downloads in the first place. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/seldo/status/1334703879431196674&#34;&gt;Per Laurie Voss, who co--founded NPM&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are mostly CI machines. Since package lock, updates don&#39;t really cause download spikes any more. The overwhelming majority of downloads are builds, not individual developers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brings up a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of questions and possible influences on these numbers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A team with a bunch of CI jobs that keep redownloading the same packages is going to have an outsized influence on the absolute number of downloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s very clearly a long tail of downloads for older versions that hang around indefinitely, so older packages seem to have a sustained base of download size. So, how many of these are for old versions vs new versions?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The NPM download stats don&#39;t account for internal package hosting/caching servers like Artifactory or NexusRepository. For example, I used to work on a team that used an internal NexusRepo instance that caches packages, so none of our usage would ever get counted publicly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What about scripts hosted on a CDN? One of Vue&#39;s selling points is that it&#39;s very &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-tag friendly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For that matter, Vue is very popular in China, and there&#39;s a Chinese mirror of NPM (&lt;code&gt;cnpm&lt;/code&gt;) that I&#39;ve heard is typically used by Chinese devs. Downloads from that won&#39;t be reflected in NPM&#39;s stats.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s possible to game the numbers. I saw one package that had only been published for the first time a few days before, and yet it somehow spiked to over 1M+ downloads a day within the next couple days. Clearly impossible, and it&#39;s likely this was due to a bot of some kind faking downloads.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For that matter, NPM&#39;s own stats aren&#39;t always reliable. There have been times when NPM recorded 0 downloads for a widely used package for a few days, or other times when there&#39;s a giant spike in downloads that can&#39;t possibly be real. For example, NPM claims that downloads of XState somehow tripled for a couple months before going back to normal, and downloads of Mobx went up by 75% for two weeks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/npm-graph-weirdness.png&#34; alt=&#34;NPM graph weirdness&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the consistent download levels before and after those periods, the spikes in numbers should be ignored as outliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/seldo/status/1334707386968227841&#34;&gt;quoting Laurie Voss&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are meaningful relative measures -- a package with more downloads than another package is more popular -- but they have never meant anything as absolute numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laurie also covered this in &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/gChULw-uEjY?t=1241&#34;&gt;a talk on the NPM registry in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As part of that talk, he described a metric called &amp;quot;share of registry&amp;quot;, which points out that the &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; size of registry downloads is always growing. This means that a lib could experience an absolute increase in downloads, but its &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; usage share could decrease. So, by checking &amp;quot;number of downloads for this package&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;total downloads for all the registry&amp;quot; over time, you get a more normalized value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked Laurie for some feedback on this post, and he reported that the NPM API offers the &amp;quot;total registry downloads&amp;quot; numbers for a given time range, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/range/2015-01-01:2015-12-31&#34;&gt;https://api.npmjs.org/downloads/range/2015-01-01:2015-12-31&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I don&#39;t know if the &amp;quot;all registry downloads&amp;quot; numbers that Laurie used to generate that graph are available publicly, and even if they are that would take some work to pull together and calculate. So, us amateurs are stuck with just looking at the absolute values and guesstimating comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, like I said, &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of flaws. But at the same time, NPM&#39;s download stats &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; basically the only hard objective numbers we as a community have to look at and infer actual usage numbers in any way. So, to some extent we end up having to look at those and make inferences, however flawed they might be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-caveats-and-concerns&#34;&gt;Other Caveats and Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea whether that Github &amp;quot;Dependents&amp;quot; list counts private repos. My guess is that it doesn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any kind of an online poll is statistically meaningless - there&#39;s no guarantee of who saw it, who chose to answer, etc, and there&#39;s a lot of ways you could answer. What if I use Redux for my day job, and Mobx when I work on a side project at home? What answer would I choose?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does &amp;quot;usage&amp;quot; mean anyway? :) Does 30 clones of a starter kit/boilerplate count as exactly 30 times as many &amp;quot;usages&amp;quot; as a team working on a single large project for multiple years? What about a project that pushes to CI dozens of times a day and rebuilds from scratch every time?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the case of &amp;quot;React state management&amp;quot; specifically... React has its own built-in component state handling. There&#39;s &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; way to measure how much that&#39;s being used as the sole state management tool, beyond trying to somehow subtract &amp;quot;downloads of all state libs&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;all React downloads&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;estimating-react-state-management-market-share&#34;&gt;Estimating React State Management Market Share&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So having just listed a ton of ways that this process is flawed and hopeless, I&#39;m now going to turn around and try to use it anyway :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to walk through some of the steps I go through to come up with estimates of &amp;quot;React state management library&amp;quot; market share. This is largely because it&#39;s the area I&#39;m most familiar with, but also frankly it&#39;s the area that seems to come up the most :) (although my perception here is also affected because I&#39;m active in the React community &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the maintainer of Redux, so of course this is a topic I would seem to see frequently.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to compare Redux and RTK vs Mobx, Zustand, XState, and React Query, and also toss in a second set of comparisons with Recoil, Jotai, Valtio, and Mobx-State-Tree. (It would be interesting to add in Apollo, SWR, and Urql as additional data fetching libraries, but c&#39;mon I can only put so much time into this blog post :) )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that these are actually somewhat different libraries - React Query isn&#39;t &amp;quot;client state management&amp;quot;, but given that it has a somewhat similar usage rate to Redux Toolkit (and folks sometimes migrate from Redux to React Query to manage server state), it often gets thrown around by people as a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparing-npm-stats&#34;&gt;Comparing NPM Stats&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, my first step is to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://npm-stat.com&#34;&gt;https://npm-stat.com&lt;/a&gt;, type in the name of several libraries, and view stats for the last couple years. This starts to give us a sense of scale and relative comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, here&#39;s Redux Toolkit, Mobx, XState, React Query, and Zustand since the start of 2020:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/state-libs-2020-2022.png&#34; alt=&#34;State management libraries - 2020-2022&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you do RTK, Redux core, React, and React-Redux?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/react-redux-2020-2022.png&#34; alt=&#34;React and Redux - 2020-2022&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, both relative growth rates and sense of scale and magnitude are useful pieces of info here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For additional comparison, here&#39;s RTK vs several other libraries:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/images/2022-07-npm-package-market-share/more-state-libs-2020-2022.png&#34; alt=&#34;More state management libraries - 2020-2022&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pulling out some of those numbers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React: 16.0M&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux: 7.7M&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux Toolkit: 1.64M&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React Query: 1.46M&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;XState: 1.11M&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mobx: 891K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zustand: 550K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recoil: 267K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jotai: 117K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mobx-State-Tree: 76K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For point of reference, when &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/lcgqnd/state_management/glzrax4/&#34;&gt;I did a similar comparison in Feb 2021&lt;/a&gt;, the numbers were:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React: 9.5M&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux: 5M&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apollo: 1.3M (combined across @apollo/client and react-apollo)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;XState: 750K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;MobX: 600K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux Toolkit: 450K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React Query: 250K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SWR: 250K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recoil: 60K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zustand: 40K&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Yes, I realize there&#39;s some differences in which libs are in each list.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from these graphs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clearly the Redux core package has vastly more downloads than any of the other state libs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RTK has passed Mobx and XState&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remember that RTK has a hard dependency on the &lt;code&gt;redux&lt;/code&gt; core, so all RTK downloads are also Redux downloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React Query has really taken off in the last year, and is gaining downloads at a slightly faster pace than RTK&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React-Redux has almost as many downloads as the Redux core, which means that most Redux users are using React&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React-Redux has historically been in the vicinity of 45-50% of React downloads, but React&#39;s growth rate has accelerated in the last two years.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux and React-Redux are seeing growth in absolute terms, but not as much as React.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m actually a bit surprised that the download rates for React-Redux and Redux core have started to diverge a bit - perhaps we&#39;re getting more non-React users?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zustand has seen quite a bit of growth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to say some of the results here kind of surprise me. Given the hype around Recoil early on, you&#39;d think that it would have more usage. RTK seems to be actively growing, while the other libs are seeing very slow growth. (Also remember that we&#39;re at the &amp;quot;smaller state libs&amp;quot; scale, and the &amp;quot;React and Redux&amp;quot; scale dwarfs any of these.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparing-github-dependents&#34;&gt;Comparing Github Dependents&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just now went through the repos for all these libraries, and manually looked up the stats on the &amp;quot;Dependents&amp;quot; page for each repo, and have them sorted by the &amp;quot;number of repos using this package&amp;quot; count:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Library&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Repos&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Packages&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;React&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;10,614,469&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;231,415&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Redux&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2,279,295&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;23,163&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;React-Redux&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2,117,795&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;18,916&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Redux Toolkit&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;275,624&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1,635&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;XState&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;133,285&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;633&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Mobx&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;106,102&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4,585&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;React Query&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;75,383&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;919&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Zustand&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;30,465&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;481&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Recoil&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;26,159&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;369&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Mobx-State-Tree&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6,829&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;360&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Jotai&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4,065&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;170&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Valtio&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1,612&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;106&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s amazing to see the scale of React itself. It just dwarfs everything else&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s a very interesting difference in ratios between the NPM download stats and the Github repo dependents stats. Redux is just about 50% of React in terms of downloads, but just barely over 20% in terms of repos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Redux and React-Redux are much closer in terms of repos than downloads, although perhaps Github doesn&#39;t count RTK-using repos as depending on &lt;code&gt;redux&lt;/code&gt;, in which case their relative ratio widens a bit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;poll-results&#34;&gt;Poll Results&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I&#39;m going to go through some of those polls I linked earlier and pull out the numbers for libraries over time:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Library&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Twitter 2019-10&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Reddit 2020-11&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Reddit 2022-02&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Redux&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;48%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;42%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;67%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Mobx&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;9%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4.5%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5.8%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Context&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;32%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;React state&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;22%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Recoil&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;6.3%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Unstated&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Zustand&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;12.5%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Jotai&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4.4%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;XState&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;3.4%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&amp;quot;Other&amp;quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly there&#39;s a lot of inconsistency here in terms of which libs are even being voted on, much less which ones are being used, plus there&#39;s a split between &amp;quot;using React state&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;using a library&amp;quot;. So, we definitely can&#39;t use these for real meaningful statistical comparisons, but you can still get a &lt;em&gt;vague&lt;/em&gt; sense of usage here. The main takeaway I would get out of this is that, yes, Redux is still pretty strong here, and there&#39;s a lot of split beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at these numbers now, with fresh eyes, here&#39;s my takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;react-s-growth-continues&#34;&gt;React&#39;s Growth Continues&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t do comparisons vs Vue, Angular, Ember, and Svelte here, but you can see by just looking at &amp;quot;React vs any other React ecosystem lib&amp;quot; that &lt;strong&gt;React is getting downloaded and used &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, and shows no signs of stopping&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; just pull up some links to framework-level usage comparisons based on similar statistics to answer a comment earlier, and they definitely do show React&#39;s lead. I&#39;ll link those here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190&#34;&gt;https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://w3techs.com/technologies/comparison/js-angularjs,js-react,js-vuejs&#34;&gt;https://w3techs.com/technologies/comparison/js-angularjs,js-react,js-vuejs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://npmtrends.com/@angular/core-vs-react-vs-vue&#34;&gt;https://npmtrends.com/@angular/core-vs-react-vs-vue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;redux-is-still-number-one-in-state-management&#34;&gt;Redux is Still Number One In State Management&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly, &lt;strong&gt;Redux is still by far the most widely used state management library with React apps&lt;/strong&gt;. No other library comes close in terms of NPM downloads and dependent repos, and even Redux Toolkit by itself is beating the other libraries handily. Additionally, the anecdata of the polls and discussions shows a lot of people saying &amp;quot;use RTK&amp;quot;, which is a noticeable change from 2018-2019 when a lot of folks were chattering about &amp;quot;Redux boilerplate&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Redux is dead&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;redux-s-total-market-share-has-dropped-vs-react&#34;&gt;Redux&#39;s Total Market Share has Dropped vs React&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said at the start of this post that I&#39;ve been repeating &amp;quot;Redux is 45-50% of React apps&amp;quot; for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, after seeing these numbers, I think I need to revise that at least partially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we look at just React, Redux, React-Redux, and RTK:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Library&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;DLs/wk&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Dependents&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;React&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;15.97M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;10.61M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Redux&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;7.45M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2.28M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;React-Redux&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5.62M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2.11M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Redux Toolkit&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1.57M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;0.27M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on NPM downloads, Redux itself is still around 45% of React, but React-Redux is only 35%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where it gets really different is in terms of dependent repos. There, Redux is only 20% of React.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&#39;m really not sure what to make of the split between numbers here. If we go back to Laurie Voss&#39;s point that &amp;quot;NPM downloads are primarily driven by CI&amp;quot;, I suppose some interpretations here might be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s a ton of repos that depend on React, but not Redux. It&#39;s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that a noticeable percentage of those are &amp;quot;starting to learn React&amp;quot; repos from beginners, and thus might be less likely to depend on Redux&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s also very likely that a larger number of new apps today are indeed less likely to add Redux, because they don&#39;t feel it&#39;s necessary&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s possible that larger professional apps &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be relatively more likely to be using Redux, and thus installing it when building in CI&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Libraries that depend on React may also contribute to the number of React downloads&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be clear, &lt;strong&gt;I don&#39;t know if any of these guesses are correct!&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m just brainstorming right now as I look at these numbers, trying to come up with possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to revise my previous &amp;quot;45-50% of React&amp;quot; estimate... the obvious potential bounds here are 20-35%, depending on how you balance &amp;quot;downloads&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;dependent repos&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as I asked earlier: how should we weigh &amp;quot;usage&amp;quot; between &amp;quot;thousands of starter app clones&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;real apps&amp;quot;? Raw numbers? Does 1 real app === 10/100/1000 starter clones? How would we even figure that out how many repos fit in those categories without completely scraping Github? :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to try to be intellectually honest with myself here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m going to revise my prior &amp;quot;45-50% of React apps use Redux&amp;quot; estimate, and lower it to &amp;quot;roughly 33% of React apps use Redux&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s a fair-ish estimate based on the combination of downloads + dependents, tweaked by the anecdata.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;wishlist&#34;&gt;Wishlist&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; nice if someone could put together a new NPM package comparison site that automates the &amp;quot;share of registry&amp;quot; metric for a given set of packages&lt;/strong&gt;. Given that you can query for &amp;quot;all registry downloads&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;per-package downloads&amp;quot; for a given time range, this seems pretty feasible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if there was also a way to query Github&#39;s API for the &amp;quot;Dependents&amp;quot; info, but it doesn&#39;t look like that&#39;s available. I did find &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58734176/how-to-use-github-api-to-get-a-repositorys-dependents-information-in-github&#34;&gt;a Stack Overflow answer showing how to scrape that info from repo pages&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess that could be a fallback option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moiva.io seems like it does a good portion of that already, and there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aantipov/moiva/issues/521&#34;&gt;an open issue to add dependents as a metric&lt;/a&gt;. I also just filed an issue asking for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aantipov/moiva/issues/559&#34;&gt;adding &amp;quot;share of registry&amp;quot; as a comparison metric&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the info I&#39;ve provided here is informative and useful for folks trying to make comparisons between different packages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yes, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; intentionally write this post to show some stats behind my repeated statements that &amp;quot;Redux is still most widely used&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;45-50% of React apps&amp;quot;. Looking at these numbers, they definitely back up the &amp;quot;most widely used&amp;quot;, but I did have to revise the &amp;quot;45-50%&amp;quot; down to about &amp;quot;33%&amp;quot; - I hadn&#39;t realized just how much the gap in downloads between React and React-Redux has grown in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;",

I recently had the chance to talk at a couple of online meetups, and put together an updated and consolidated version of that material as a complete &amp;quot;Modern Redux with Redux Toolkit&amp;quot; presentation:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-redux-with-redux-toolkit-video-https-www-youtube-com-watch-v-14xgphtow1y&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14XGPHtoW1Y&#34;&gt;Modern Redux with Redux Toolkit - video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-redux-with-redux-toolkit-slides-presentations-2022-06-modern-redux-rtk&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/2022-06-modern-redux-rtk/&#34;&gt;Modern Redux with Redux Toolkit - slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;",

    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spoken at Reactathon in past years, and this year I had the chance to give a pre-recorded talk. I also ended up giving the same talk live as well after filling in as a backup speaker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My talk looked at why we use middleware for side effects in Redux, the major libraries (thunks, sagas, observables), why we&#39;ve recommended thunks, introduces RTK Query and the &amp;quot;listener&amp;quot; middleware, and gives our current recommendations for what tools to use in different scenarios today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-evolution-of-redux-async-logic-slides-presentations-2022-05-evolution-redux-async-logic&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/2022-05-evolution-redux-async-logic/&#34;&gt;The Evolution of Redux Async Logic - slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The video should be online in the next few weeks, but for now you can see me give the talk as part of the Day 3 livestream:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-evolution-of-redux-async-logic-livestream-video-https-youtu-be-0qk2-wi4t3k-t-11266&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/0qK2_wi4t3k?t=11266&#34;&gt;The Evolution of Redux Async Logic - livestream video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;",

    "partialText": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to give a talk at the first-ever Typescript Congress virtual conference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My talk went over a variety of things I&#39;ve learned working on the TypeScript aspects of the Redux libraries over the last few years. I covered things like different ways to include types when publishing, approaches for versioning public types APIs, supporting multiple TS versions, debugging and testing types, and some wacky examples of actual types from our libraries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recorded talk can be viewed on the TS Congress website:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-from-maintaining-ts-libraries-video-https-portal-gitnation-org-contents-lessons-from-maintaining-typescript-libraries&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/lessons-from-maintaining-typescript-libraries&#34;&gt;Lessons from Maintaining TS Libraries - video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the slides are here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-from-maintaining-ts-libraries-slides-presentations-2022-04-ts-lib-maintenance&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/2022-04-ts-lib-maintenance/&#34;&gt;Lessons from Maintaining TS Libraries - slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;",
