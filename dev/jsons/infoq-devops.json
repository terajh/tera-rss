    "partialText": "&lt;img src=\"https://www.infoq.com/styles/static/images/logo/logo_bigger.jpg\"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new CNCF report identifies Kubernetes as the primary engine for AI growth, with 82% production adoption. However, technical maturity has outpaced organisational change. Human factors, such as siloed team structures and a lack of cross-functional collaboration, now serve as the leading barriers to successful deployment, making cultural transformation the decisive factor for AI scaling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;By Mark Silvester&lt;/i&gt;",

This approach frees engineers to focus on analysis and judgment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;By Rohit Dhawan&lt;/i&gt;",
