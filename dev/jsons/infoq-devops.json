After identifying the breakage and the ambiguity in older DNS standards regarding record order, Cloudflare proposes a clarified specification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;By Renato Losio&lt;/i&gt;",

This approach frees engineers to focus on analysis and judgment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;i&gt;By Rohit Dhawan&lt;/i&gt;",
