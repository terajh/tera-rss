    "partialText": "Hi everyone,\n\nGreat news! [Vue v3.1.0-beta](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) has been released with a set of new features and bug fixes, including the onServerPrefetch lifecycle hook!\n\nBut that’s not all, because v3.1 comes with the thing we all have been looking forward to for months. The [Vue 2 to 3 Migration Build](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/tree/master/packages/vue-compat)! It allows you to run Vue 3 and the SFC compiler in a backward compatible mode so you can work through the deprecations/breaking-changes 1 by 1, instead of having to rewrite the whole app at once.\n\nIf you are wondering how viable it is in a real-life, production application – I’ve tried it on a pretty large one (1k+ components) and managed to make it run and be partially functional within less than 2 hours. I’m convinced that I should be able to fully stabilize it within a few days. Wish me luck! 🤞\n\nAlso, the new [beta for Vue-Devtools v6](https://headwayapp.co/vue-js-devtools-changelog/vue-2-support-plugin-permissions-193021) now supports Vue 2.x. No need to toggle different extension versions when switching projects.\n\nBy the way, did you know that Vue was used in the mission during the Mars 2020 Helicopter mission? Well, now you do! And if you contributed, you should have a [fancy badge on GitHub](https://twitter.com/notphanan/status/1385624940003610624).\n\nLastly, my favorite WYSIWYG editor – [tiptap](https://www.tiptap.dev/) – is now supporting Vue 3 with their new v2.0 beta release. Now rewritten in TypeScript.\n\nHave a great week,\n\n— *[Damian Dulisz](https://twitter.com/DamianDulisz)*",

    "partialText": "Hi there!\n\nLast month might not have been the most eventful when it comes to Vue news, but there’s been plenty of exciting new libraries for Vue 3.0. Those include:\n\n- [🍍Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/) – a new Vuex alternative created by Eduardo San Martin Morote\n- [✋Vue-UseGesture](https://vue-use-gesture.netlify.app/) – a composable that helps you handle all kinds of mouse and touch events, including complex gestures by Mesut Koca\n- [🪄useMagicKeys](https://vueuse.org/core/usemagickeys/) – a composable that allows you to easily set keyboard shortcuts by Anthony Fu and the VueUse team\n- [📐Splitpanes](https://antoniandre.github.io/splitpanes/) – a library that makes dynamic splitpanes a breeze by Antoni \"antoniandre\"\n\nThere’s also been one pretty impactful news –[ Vue 3.0 will likely drop support for IE 11](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/296). As dramatic as it sounds, Vue 3.0 was not supporting IE 11 at any time, but there was the plan to create a 3.0-compat build, that would support IE 11. Instead, the new idea (still in RFC) is to backport as many Vue 3.0 features (like the Composition-API) back into Vue 2.x. This should both ensure a smoother migration from Vue 2.x to 3.x, while also reducing the maintenance burden of supporting 2 builds of Vue 3.0. Additionally, this also removes the need to support IE 11 by all the 3rd party libraries.\n\nIt also means that the Composition-API plugin for Vue 2.x will be obsolete, which is a good thing, because once the API becomes part of the core, the plugin-performance-tax will be removed. As an added benefit, Vue 2.x is being [migrated to TypeScript](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1379797086800113665) as we speak, which should improve the overall developer experience of those using TS.\n\nLastly, [VueConf.us](https://vueconf.us/) is happening in on April 14th. It’s a completely free event and from what I’ve heard, there are some exciting announcements to look for! Don’t miss it – the tickets are available only until April 13th. ⏰\n\nStay safe and enjoy the rest of the newsletter,\n\n— *[Damian Dulisz](https://twitter.com/DamianDulisz)*\n\n*P.S.

First of all, [Evan’s State of Vuenion 2021 talk at Vue.js Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El8Jw2CFj7g) where he is covering the recent developments in the Vue ecosystem. How Vue is doing (like [NASA using it to drive their mission control system](https://github.com/nasa/openmct)), new releases, and future plans! The recording ends with the announcement and highlights from [Monterail](https://www.monterail.com/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)’s annual State of Vue report, which you can download [here](https://www.monterail.com/state-of-vue-2021-report?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).\n\nVite – the frontend build tool everyone is crazy about [has hit v2](https://dev.to/yyx990803/announcing-vite-2-0-2f0a?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). It is a big milestone for the project as it is no longer limited to Vue only (though I would recommend using it for Vue projects starting now).\n\nNext – Vuex 5. Wait, what? Five? Hasn’t version 4 been released just recently? Yes, it was, but it was a mostly backward-compatible port of Vuex 3 dedicated to Vue 3.0. \n\nVersion 5 on the other hand is a completely new state management library. Although it still keeps some ideas from the Vuex you know (and the name), it presents a new approach to state management. Why? The Vuex team has learned a lot from the limitations and pain-points of the current implementation and decided it is time to move forward with new ideas. Make sure to read the [RFC](https://github.com/kiaking/rfcs/blob/vuex-5/active-rfcs/0000-vuex-5.md) and join the [discussion](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/270).\n\nThat’s not all!

It allows you to use local files (Markdown, JSON, YAML etc.) as a Git-based CMS. You can be familiar with this approach if you used VuePress or Gridsome. Of course, you can use Vue components inside your Markdown files. Make sure to check the docs!\n\nCheers,\n— [*Damian Dulisz*](https://twitter.com/damiandulisz)",

    "partialText": "Hey there,\n\nAs you all know \"*Vue*\" in French stands for \"*View*\" and pretty much describes what Vue.js doing – handling the view part. This week, I’d like to introduce you to \"*[Vite](https://github.com/vuejs/vite)*\", which means \"*Fast*\". It’s a brand new development setup created by Evan You ([tweets for context](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1252173663199277058)). It ditches bundling in the development phase in favor of using native ES imports with on demand compilation of Vue single-file component files and more. Also acts as a local server and is capable of bundling production code using Rollup.\n\nWhat does it mean? The fact that it is crazy fast. Cold start clocks at around 140ms compared to Vue-CLI 1900ms. But now the best part – changes in code are reflected in the browser almost instantly, without a page reload. HMR that is actually reliable! 🎉\n\nHold your horses though... Vite is currently still in the experimental phase. You can learn more about the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs/vite) and follow [Evan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) for more updates like this [one](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1258059968542097410).\n\nAh, and there is already [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/)! Obviously it’s still a work-in-progress but you can play with it. Just like Vite, it ships with Vue 3.0-beta.\n\nStay safe,\n— *[Damian Dulisz](https://twitter.com/DamianDulisz)*",

Like an online encyclopedia of sorts, but everyone can contribute? 🙃 It’s maintained by the good people from Wikimedia as well as volunteers and a few days ago the decision has been made for [Wikimedia to adopt Vue](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241180)! Does it mean Wikipedia will now become a Vue SPA – 99,9% not! But it means some parts of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects might be using Vue to enhance some of the more complicated, interactive elements. Like the page editor for example. If you’ve been wondering why Vue is called the \"progressive framework\" this use-case explains it pretty well I think.\n\nAs most conferences and meetups get canceled due to the pandemic, many organisers are embracing online events. You can watch the [#1 Vue.js Amsterdam Virtual Meetup here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?index=2&list=PLCxzy-hmQq9Hj8j4zChXJpfBFhfVdUiKN&t=0s&v=6IM9gphOvXw). Additionally, a new initiative has been born, largely thanks to [Maria Lamardo](https://twitter.com/marialamardo) in the form of Vue Global Meetup that aims to help collaborate different Vue communities around the world to broadcast online meetups. The first of such will happen on the 14th of April. [Sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/vue-global-meetup-tickets-101090117262?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch) if you would like to participate!\n\nSpeaking of events – there are several [new videos from Vue.js Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCxzy-hmQq9FnnpckFDeDtbpsUqxdheQn)!

First of all, lets congratulate [Kia King Ishii](https://twitter.com/KiaKing85/status/1237747709303345154) on joining the Vue.js core team! 🎉 He has been doing an incredible job building [vuex-orm](https://github.com/vuex-orm/vuex-orm) and will now focus on working on the next versions of Vuex.\n\nSpeaking of which – [Vuex v4.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha.1) has just been released! This is the version of Vuex that will work with Vue 3.0 but keep the familiar API you know from the current version.\n\nWait, there’s more – [Nuxt.js v2.12](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.12.0) is here! Among multiple changes it introduces a [new fetch hook](https://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-fetch) that allows you to fetch asynchronous data during SSR in any component that is being rendered (not just /pages components). 🔥 To sweeten it up, the Nuxt team also added support for [TypeScript in create-nuxt-app v2.15](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app/releases/tag/v2.15.0)!\n\nFinally something to keep you busy during the likely extended stay at home: Vue.js Amsterdam have released almost 30 talks from the recent conference. You can [watch the talks here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCxzy-hmQq9FnnpckFDeDtbpsUqxdheQn) with new ones added every other day.\n\nAnd tomorrow (March 19) – you can join an [online meetup](https://www.vuemeetup.com/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#/) with [Chris Fritz](http://twitter.com/chrisvfritz/) and [Rahul Kadyan](https://twitter.com/znck0/) organised by [This Dot: Media](https://twitter.com/thisdotmedia).\n\nStay safe and see you next week!\n\n— *[Damian Dulisz](http://twitter.com/damiandulisz)*",

But his work was more than just the docs. Chris has contributed to how the Vue core and the official supporting libraries look like right now. He has also helped establish good practices, the official style guide and (if you remember Vue 1.x) the migration helper.

But now we have [vue-cli-plugin-vue-next](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli-plugin-vue-next)! 🔥\n\nThis makes it as easy as adding a new plugin to your Vue-CLI based app. It takes care of configuring the webpack to use a new .vue files compiler.

Recently [Guillaume Chau](http://twitter.com/akryum) aka Akryum has been on a building spree. He just released the [vue-apollo v4.0-alpha](https://v4.apollo.vuejs.org/guide-composable/) which is built with Vue Composition API in mind. But that’s not all. He also added [server-side rendering support to the @vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api/pull/198) plugin. And then he refactored the [awesomejs.dev](https://awesomejs.dev/) website to use both of those libraries. You can see the changes in this [commit](https://github.com/Akryum/awesomejs.dev/commit/e59a65f6d318cfad9f340681e843d2de20d032fb). It might give you a good impression on how the Composition API might change the way you write components.

Keep in mind this is still an RFC, which means your feedback is more than welcome.\n\nThere’s even a separate [VuePress page with docs on how the Composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/) would work, that I highly recommend you to read.\n\nAlso, Nuxt.js has just [hit the 2.9.0 version](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.9.0) with several new features and bug fixes.

Great read!\n\nAlthough the Vue Function API is still under consideration as a part of the RFC process, it has already picked up in the community thanks to the [vue-function-api](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-function-api) library, which allows you to use it in your current Vue 2.x apps. There’s a [great article](https://xebia.com/blog/next-generation-async-functions-with-vue-async-function/) by Albert Brand on how to use it to fetch data with ease thanks to a utility library he wrote on top of the function API.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n— [Damian Dulisz](https://twitter.com/damiandulisz)",

With Vue v2.6 the SSR data-fetching has been rewritten and now supports \"pausing\" during rendering, so that additional asynchronous data can be fetched.

[Check out the new guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/data.html). 🚀\n\nDon’t go crazy though. Every request in a sequence increases the time before the page will be rendered, so keep that in mind.\n\nBy the way, in just 2 weeks, me, Gregg and Adam will be at [VueConf.US](http://vueconf.us/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in Tampa, Florida.

It’s an alternative pattern to solve the code-sharing/reusability problem that is usually solved with mixins, higher-order components or render props (think scoped slots or renderless components).\nHooks should help you extract shared logic that you wouldn’t be able to easily extract otherwise.
