There are four main types: fiat-backed (like USDT), asset-backed (like PAX Gold), algorithmic (like DAI), and calibration-based (like O coin). Each has different mechanisms, risks, and use cases. Fiat-backed coins offer simplicity but require trust in centralized reserves. Asset-backed coins provide tangible backing but face supply limitations. Algorithmic coins are decentralized but can fail under extreme conditions. Calibration-based coins offer unlimited supply and stability through real-world price observation. Understanding these differences is crucial for anyone navigating the cryptocurrency space.",
