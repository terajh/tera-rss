This article introduces Ackgent, a production-ready starter kit that leverages the new Agent Config feature in Google ADK (v1.12.0+) to shift development toward a declarative paradigm. Instead of writing intricate Python boilerplate for execution and state management, developers can now define agent behaviors, tools, and multi-agent orchestration using simple YAML files. By combining this approach with modern tooling like uv and just, Ackgent offers a faster, more accessible path to building scalable agents on Google Cloud Run, paving the way for a future where agent creation is accessible to non-technical builders.",
