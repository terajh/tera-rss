    "partialText": "Machine learning models rarely fail in production because of flawed algorithms. They fail because the underlying data platform lacks enforceable guarantees around ingestion, historical correctness, transformation logic, and observability. As ML systems mature, reliability depends on reproducibility, bounded freshness, and cross-team alignment. Organizations that treat data platforms as production infrastructure—not analytics tooling—reduce operational risk and build AI systems that scale sustainably.",

By aligning incentives around paid subscriptions instead of advertising, enabling peer-driven discovery, prioritizing ownership and exit rights, and building around long-form, trust-based relationships, Substack creates a distributed “garden” ecosystem. In an era where AI can mass-produce authoritative content, platforms that reward originality, depth, and earned trust may become increasingly valuable.",
