Ethical positioning protects reputation, while defense integration continues through controlled deployments and negotiation. Public perception, procurement leverage, and backchannel talks all shape how AI becomes embedded in national security infrastructure. Anthropic’s public ethical stance and Pentagon pressure likely reflect negotiation leverage, not disengagement. AI integration continues behind controlled federal deployments.",
