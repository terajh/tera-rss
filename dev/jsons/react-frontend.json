Go to <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">react.dev/blog</a> to see the recent posts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React 18</a> was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we’ve learned is that it’s frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we’re exploring.</p>\n<p>We typically have a number of projects being worked on at any time, ranging from the more experimental to the clearly defined. Looking ahead, we’d like to start regularly sharing more about what we’ve been working on with the community across these projects.</p>\n<p>To set expectations, this is not a roadmap with clear timelines. Many of these projects are under active research and are difficult to put concrete ship dates on. They may possibly never even ship in their current iteration depending on what we learn. Instead, we want to share with you the problem spaces we’re actively thinking about, and what we’ve learned so far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"server-components\"><a href=\"#server-components\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Server Components </h2>\n<p>We announced an <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">experimental demo of React Server Components</a> (RSC) in December 2020. Since then we’ve been finishing up its dependencies in React 18, and working on changes inspired by experimental feedback.</p>\n<p>In particular, we’re abandoning the idea of having forked I/O libraries (eg react-fetch), and instead adopting an async/await model for better compatibility. This doesn’t technically block RSC’s release because you can also use routers for data fetching. Another change is that we’re also moving away from the file extension approach in favor of <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/189#issuecomment-1116482278\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">annotating boundaries</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re working together with Vercel and Shopify to unify bundler support for shared semantics in both Webpack and Vite. Before launch, we want to make sure that the semantics of RSCs are the same across the whole React ecosystem. This is the major blocker for reaching stable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"asset-loading\"><a href=\"#asset-loading\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Asset Loading </h2>\n<p>Currently, assets like scripts, external styles, fonts, and images are typically preloaded and loaded using external systems. This can make it tricky to coordinate across new environments like streaming, server components, and more.\nWe’re looking at adding APIs to preload and load deduplicated external assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.</p>\n<p>We’re also looking at having these support Suspense so you can have images, CSS, and fonts that block display until they’re loaded but don’t block streaming and concurrent rendering. This can help avoid <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1516852731251724293\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">“popcorning“</a> as the visuals pop and layout shifts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"static-server-rendering-optimizations\"><a href=\"#static-server-rendering-optimizations\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Static Server Rendering Optimizations </h2>\n<p>Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are great ways to get performance for cacheable pages, but we think we can add features to improve performance of dynamic Server Side Rendering (SSR) – especially when most but not all of the content is cacheable. We’re exploring ways to optimize server rendering utilizing compilation and static passes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"react-compiler\"><a href=\"#react-compiler\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>React Optimizing Compiler </h2>\n<p>We gave an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">early preview</a> of React Forget at React Conf 2021. It’s a compiler that automatically generates the equivalent of <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">useMemo</code> and <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">useCallback</code> calls to minimize the cost of re-rendering, while retaining React’s programming model.</p>\n<p>Recently, we finished a rewrite of the compiler to make it more reliable and capable. This new architecture allows us to analyze and memoize more complex patterns such as the use of <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure#local-mutation-your-components-little-secret\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">local mutations</a>, and opens up many new compile-time optimization opportunities beyond just being on par with memoization hooks.</p>\n<p>We’re also working on a playground for exploring many aspects of the compiler. While the goal of the playground is to make development of the compiler easier, we think that it will make it easier to try it out and build intuition for what the compiler does. It reveals various insights into how it works under the hood, and live renders the compiler’s outputs as you type. This will be shipped together with the compiler when it’s released.</p>\n<h2 id=\"offscreen\"><a href=\"#offscreen\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Offscreen </h2>\n<p>Today, if you want to hide and show a component, you have two options. One is to add or remove it from the tree completely. The problem with this approach is that the state of your UI is lost each time you unmount, including state stored in the DOM, like scroll position.</p>\n<p>The other option is to keep the component mounted and toggle the appearance visually using CSS. This preserves the state of your UI, but it comes at a performance cost, because React must keep rendering the hidden component and all of its children whenever it receives new updates.</p>\n<p>Offscreen introduces a third option: hide the UI visually, but deprioritize its content. The idea is similar in spirit to the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">content-visibility</code> CSS property: when content is hidden, it doesn’t need to stay in sync with the rest of the UI. React can defer the rendering work until the rest of the app is idle, or until the content becomes visible again.</p>\n<p>Offscreen is a low level capability that unlocks high level features. Similar to React’s other concurrent features like <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">startTransition</code>, in most cases you won’t interact with the Offscreen API directly, but instead via an opinionated framework to implement patterns like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Instant transitions.</strong> Some routing frameworks already prefetch data to speed up subsequent navigations, like when hovering over a link. With Offscreen, they’ll also be able to prerender the next screen in the background.</li>\n<li><strong>Reusable state.</strong> Similarly, when navigating between routes or tabs, you can use Offscreen to preserve the state of the previous screen so you can switch back and pick up where you left off.</li>\n<li><strong>Virtualized list rendering.</strong> When displaying large lists of items, virtualized list frameworks will prerender more rows than are currently visible. You can use Offscreen to prerender the hidden rows at a lower priority than the visible items in the list.</li>\n<li><strong>Backgrounded content.</strong> We’re also exploring a related feature for deprioritizing content in the background without hiding it, like when displaying a modal overlay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"transition-tracing\"><a href=\"#transition-tracing\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Transition Tracing </h2>\n<p>Currently, React has two profiling tools. The <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">original Profiler</a> shows an overview of all the commits in a profiling session. For each commit, it also shows all components that rendered and the amount of time it took for them to render. We also have a beta version of a <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Timeline Profiler</a> introduced in React 18 that shows when components schedule updates and when React works on these updates. Both of these profilers help developers identify performance problems in their code.</p>\n<p>We’ve realized that developers don’t find knowing about individual slow commits or components out of context that useful. It’s more useful to know about what actually causes the slow commits. And that developers want to be able to track specific interactions (eg a button click, an initial load, or a page navigation) to watch for performance regressions and to understand why an interaction was slow and how to fix it.</p>\n<p>We previously tried to solve this issue by creating an <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/8de925562903afd2e7a12554adcdda16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Interaction Tracing API</a>, but it had some fundamental design flaws that reduced the accuracy of tracking why an interaction was slow and sometimes resulted in interactions never ending. We ended up <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">removing this API</a> because of these issues.</p>\n<p>We are working on a new version for the Interaction Tracing API (tentatively called Transition Tracing because it is initiated via <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">startTransition</code>) that solves these problems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-react-docs\"><a href=\"#new-react-docs\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>New React Docs </h2>\n<p>Last year, we announced the <a href=\"https://react.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">beta version</a> of the new React documentation website. The new learning materials teach Hooks first and has new diagrams, illustrations, as well as many interactive examples and challenges. We took a break from that work to focus on the React 18 release, but now that React 18 is out, we’re actively working to finish and ship the new documentation.</p>\n<p>We are currently writing a detailed section about effects, as we’ve heard that is one of the more challenging topics for both new and experienced React users. <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Synchronizing with Effects</a> is the first published page in the series, and there are more to come in the following weeks. When we first started writing a detailed section about effects, we’ve realized that many common effect patterns can be simplified by adding a new primitive to React. We’ve shared some initial thoughts on that in the <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/220\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">useEvent RFC</a>. It is currently in early research, and we are still iterating on the idea. We appreciate the community’s comments on the RFC so far, as well as the <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/3308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">feedback</a> and contributions to the ongoing documentation rewrite. We’d specifically like to thank <a href=\"https://github.com/harish-sethuraman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Harish Kumar</a> for submitting and reviewing many improvements to the new website implementation.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiebits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sophie Alpert</a> for reviewing this blog post!</em></p>",

We think this is largely true for application developers, though the story may be a bit more complicated for library maintainers.</p>\n<p>Concurrency is not a feature, per se. It’s a new behind-the-scenes mechanism that enables React to prepare multiple versions of your UI at the same time. You can think of concurrency as an implementation detail — it’s valuable because of the features that it unlocks. React uses sophisticated techniques in its internal implementation, like priority queues and multiple buffering. But you won’t see those concepts anywhere in our public APIs.</p>\n<p>When we design APIs, we try to hide implementation details from developers. As a React developer, you focus on <em>what</em> you want the user experience to look like, and React handles <em>how</em> to deliver that experience. So we don’t expect React developers to know how concurrency works under the hood.</p>\n<p>However, Concurrent React is more important than a typical implementation detail — it’s a foundational update to React’s core rendering model. So while it’s not super important to know how concurrency works, it may be worth knowing what it is at a high level.</p>\n<p>A key property of Concurrent React is that rendering is interruptible. When you first upgrade to React 18, before adding any concurrent features, updates are rendered the same as in previous versions of React — in a single, uninterrupted, synchronous transaction. With synchronous rendering, once an update starts rendering, nothing can interrupt it until the user can see the result on screen.</p>\n<p>In a concurrent render, this is not always the case. React may start rendering an update, pause in the middle, then continue later. It may even abandon an in-progress render altogether. React guarantees that the UI will appear consistent even if a render is interrupted. To do this, it waits to perform DOM mutations until the end, once the entire tree has been evaluated. With this capability, React can prepare new screens in the background without blocking the main thread. This means the UI can respond immediately to user input even if it’s in the middle of a large rendering task, creating a fluid user experience.</p>\n<p>Another example is reusable state. Concurrent React can remove sections of the UI from the screen, then add them back later while reusing the previous state. For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to restore the previous screen in the same state it was in before. In an upcoming minor, we’re planning to add a new component called <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">&lt;Offscreen></code> that implements this pattern. Similarly, you’ll be able to use Offscreen to prepare new UI in the background so that it’s ready before the user reveals it.</p>\n<p>Concurrent rendering is a powerful new tool in React and most of our new features are built to take advantage of it, including Suspense, transitions, and streaming server rendering. But React 18 is just the beginning of what we aim to build on this new foundation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gradually-adopting-concurrent-features\"><a href=\"#gradually-adopting-concurrent-features\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gradually Adopting Concurrent Features </h2>\n<p>Technically, concurrent rendering is a breaking change. Because concurrent rendering is interruptible, components behave slightly differently when it is enabled.</p>\n<p>In our testing, we’ve upgraded thousands of components to React 18. What we’ve found is that nearly all existing components “just work” with concurrent rendering, without any changes. However, some of them may require some additional migration effort. Although the changes are usually small, you’ll still have the ability to make them at your own pace. The new rendering behavior in React 18 is <strong>only enabled in the parts of your app that use new features.</strong></p>\n<p>The overall upgrade strategy is to get your application running on React 18 without breaking existing code. Then you can gradually start adding concurrent features at your own pace. You can use <a href=\"/docs/strict-mode.html\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">&lt;StrictMode></code></a> to help surface concurrency-related bugs during development. Strict Mode doesn’t affect production behavior, but during development it will log extra warnings and double-invoke functions that are expected to be idempotent. It won’t catch everything, but it’s effective at preventing the most common types of mistakes.</p>\n<p>After you upgrade to React 18, you’ll be able to start using concurrent features immediately. For example, you can use startTransition to navigate between screens without blocking user input. Or useDeferredValue to throttle expensive re-renders.</p>\n<p>However, long term, we expect the main way you’ll add concurrency to your app is by using a concurrent-enabled library or framework. In most cases, you won’t interact with concurrent APIs directly. For example, instead of developers calling startTransition whenever they navigate to a new screen, router libraries will automatically wrap navigations in startTransition.</p>\n<p>It may take some time for libraries to upgrade to be concurrent compatible. We’ve provided new APIs to make it easier for libraries to take advantage of concurrent features. In the meantime, please be patient with maintainers as we work to gradually migrate the React ecosystem.</p>\n<p>For more info, see our previous post: <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How to upgrade to React 18</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"suspense-in-data-frameworks\"><a href=\"#suspense-in-data-frameworks\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Suspense in Data Frameworks </h2>\n<p>In React 18, you can start using Suspense for data fetching in opinionated frameworks like Relay, Next.js, Hydrogen, or Remix. Ad hoc data fetching with Suspense is technically possible, but still not recommended as a general strategy.</p>\n<p>In the future, we may expose additional primitives that could make it easier to access your data with Suspense, perhaps without the use of an opinionated framework. However, Suspense works best when it’s deeply integrated into your application’s architecture: your router, your data layer, and your server rendering environment. So even long term, we expect that libraries and frameworks will play a crucial role in the React ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As in previous versions of React, you can also use Suspense for code splitting on the client with React.lazy. But our vision for Suspense has always been about much more than loading code — the goal is to extend support for Suspense so that eventually, the same declarative Suspense fallback can handle any asynchronous operation (loading code, data, images, etc).</p>\n<h2 id=\"server-components-is-still-in-development\"><a href=\"#server-components-is-still-in-development\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Server Components is Still in Development </h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Server Components</strong></a> is an upcoming feature that allows developers to build apps that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering.

Otherwise they feel “wrong”. However, transitions are different because the user doesn’t expect to see every intermediate value on screen.</p>\n<p>For example, when you select a filter in a dropdown, you expect the filter button itself to respond immediately when you click. However, the actual results may transition separately. A small delay would be imperceptible and often expected. And if you change the filter again before the results are done rendering, you only care to see the latest results.</p>\n<p>Typically, for the best user experience, a single user input should result in both an urgent update and a non-urgent one. You can use startTransition API inside an input event to inform React which updates are urgent and which are “transitions”:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>startTransition<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Urgent: Show what was typed</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">setInputValue</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>input<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Mark any state updates inside as transitions</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">startTransition</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// Transition: Show the results</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">setSearchQuery</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>input<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Updates wrapped in startTransition are handled as non-urgent and will be interrupted if more urgent updates like clicks or key presses come in. If a transition gets interrupted by the user (for example, by typing multiple characters in a row), React will throw out the stale rendering work that wasn’t finished and render only the latest update.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">useTransition</code>: a hook to start transitions, including a value to track the pending state.</li>\n<li><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">startTransition</code>: a method to start transitions when the hook cannot be used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Transitions will opt in to concurrent rendering, which allows the update to be interrupted. If the content re-suspends, transitions also tell React to continue showing the current content while rendering the transition content in the background (see the <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Suspense RFC</a> for more info).</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/react-api.html#transitions\">See docs for transitions here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-suspense-features\"><a href=\"#new-suspense-features\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>New Suspense Features </h3>\n<p>Suspense lets you declaratively specify the loading state for a part of the component tree if it’s not yet ready to be displayed:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Suspense</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">fallback</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Spinner</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n  </span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Comments</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">\n</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Suspense</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Suspense makes the “UI loading state” a first-class declarative concept in the React programming model.

Instead, React will delay the render until enough data has loaded to prevent a bad loading state.</p>\n<p>For more, see the RFC for <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Suspense in React 18</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-client-and-server-rendering-apis\"><a href=\"#new-client-and-server-rendering-apis\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>New Client and Server Rendering APIs </h3>\n<p>In this release we took the opportunity to redesign the APIs we expose for rendering on the client and server.

For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to immediately show the previous screen. To do this, React would unmount and remount trees using the same component state as before.</p>\n<p>This feature will give React apps better performance out-of-the-box, but requires components to be resilient to effects being mounted and destroyed multiple times. Most effects will work without any changes, but some effects assume they are only mounted or destroyed once.</p>\n<p>To help surface these issues, React 18 introduces a new development-only check to Strict Mode. This new check will automatically unmount and remount every component, whenever a component mounts for the first time, restoring the previous state on the second mount.</p>\n<p>Before this change, React would mount the component and create the effects:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-text\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">* React mounts the component.\n  * Layout effects are created.\n  * Effects are created.</code></pre></div>\n<p>With Strict Mode in React 18, React will simulate unmounting and remounting the component in development mode:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-text\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">* React mounts the component.\n  * Layout effects are created.\n  * Effects are created.\n* React simulates unmounting the component.\n  * Layout effects are destroyed.\n  * Effects are destroyed.\n* React simulates mounting the component with the previous state.\n  * Layout effects are created.\n  * Effects are created.</code></pre></div>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/strict-mode.html#ensuring-reusable-state\">See docs for ensuring reusable state here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-hooks\"><a href=\"#new-hooks\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>New Hooks </h3>\n<h4 id=\"useid\"><a href=\"#useid\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>useId </h4>\n<p><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">useId</code> is a new hook for generating unique IDs on both the client and server, while avoiding hydration mismatches.

Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. Before React 18, we only batched updates inside React event handlers.

To support React 18, some libraries may need to switch to one of the following APIs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">useSyncExternalStore</code> is a new hook that allows external stores to support concurrent reads by forcing updates to the store to be synchronous. This new API is recommended for any library that integrates with state external to React. For more information, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">useSyncExternalStore overview post</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/86\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">useSyncExternalStore API details</a>.</li>\n<li><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">useInsertionEffect</code> is a new hook that allows CSS-in-JS libraries to address performance issues of injecting styles in render. Unless you’ve already built a CSS-in-JS library we don’t expect you to ever use this. This hook will run after the DOM is mutated, but before layout effects read the new layout. This solves an issue that already exists in React 17 and below, but is even more important in React 18 because React yields to the browser during concurrent rendering, giving it a chance to recalculate layout.

For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to immediately show the previous screen. To do this, React would unmount and remount trees using the same component state as before.</p>\n<p>This feature will give React better performance out-of-the-box, but requires components to be resilient to effects being mounted and destroyed multiple times. Most effects will work without any changes, but some effects assume they are only mounted or destroyed once.</p>\n<p>To help surface these issues, React 18 introduces a new development-only check to Strict Mode. This new check will automatically unmount and remount every component, whenever a component mounts for the first time, restoring the previous state on the second mount.</p>\n<p>Before this change, React would mount the component and create the effects:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-text\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">* React mounts the component.\n    * Layout effects are created.\n    * Effect effects are created.</code></pre></div>\n<p>With Strict Mode in React 18, React will simulate unmounting and remounting the component in development mode:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-text\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">* React mounts the component.\n    * Layout effects are created.\n    * Effect effects are created.\n* React simulates unmounting the component.\n    * Layout effects are destroyed.\n    * Effects are destroyed.\n* React simulates mounting the component with the previous state.\n    * Layout effect setup code runs\n    * Effect setup code runs</code></pre></div>\n<p>For more information, see the Working Group posts for <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Adding Reusable State to StrictMode</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How to support Reusable State in Effects</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"configuring-your-testing-environment\"><a href=\"#configuring-your-testing-environment\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Configuring Your Testing Environment </h2>\n<p>When you first update your tests to use <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">createRoot</code>, you may see this warning in your test console:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The current testing environment is not configured to support act(…)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To fix this, set <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">globalThis.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT</code> to <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">true</code> before running your test:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token comment\">// In your test setup file</span>\nglobalThis<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The purpose of the flag is to tell React that it’s running in a unit test-like environment.

Previously, the behavior wasn’t always predictable or consistent.</li>\n<li><strong>Stricter hydration errors</strong>: Hydration mismatches due to missing or extra text content are now treated like errors instead of warnings. React will no longer attempt to “patch up” individual nodes by inserting or deleting a node on the client in an attempt to match the server markup, and will revert to client rendering up to the closest <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">&lt;Suspense></code> boundary in the tree. This ensures the hydrated tree is consistent and avoids potential privacy and security holes that can be caused by hydration mismatches.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense trees are always consistent:</strong> If a component suspends before it’s fully added to the tree, React will not add it to the tree in an incomplete state or fire its effects. Instead, React will throw away the new tree completely, wait for the asynchronous operation to finish, and then retry rendering again from scratch. React will render the retry attempt concurrently, and without blocking the browser.</li>\n<li><strong>Layout Effects with Suspense</strong>: When a tree re-suspends and reverts to a fallback, React will now clean up layout effects, and then re-create them when the content inside the boundary is shown again. This fixes an issue which prevented component libraries from correctly measuring layout when used with Suspense.</li>\n<li><strong>New JS Environment Requirements</strong>: React now depends on modern browsers features including <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">Promise</code>, <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">Symbol</code>, and <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">Object.assign</code>. If you support older browsers and devices such as Internet Explorer which do not provide modern browser features natively or have non-compliant implementations, consider including a global polyfill in your bundled application.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"other-notable-changes\"><a href=\"#other-notable-changes\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Other Notable Changes </h2>\n<h3 id=\"react\"><a href=\"#react\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>React </h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Components can now render <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">undefined</code>:</strong> React no longer warns if you return <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">undefined</code> from a component. This makes the allowed component return values consistent with values that are allowed in the middle of a component tree. We suggest to use a linter to prevent mistakes like forgetting a <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">return</code> statement before JSX.</li>\n<li><strong>In tests, <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">act</code> warnings are now opt-in:</strong> If you’re running end-to-end tests, the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">act</code> warnings are unnecessary. We’ve introduced an <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/102\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">opt-in</a> mechanism so you can enable them only for unit tests where they are useful and beneficial.</li>\n<li><strong>No warning about <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">setState</code> on unmounted components:</strong> Previously, React warned about memory leaks when you call <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">setState</code> on an unmounted component. This warning was added for subscriptions, but people primarily run into it in scenarios where setting state is fine, and workarounds make the code worse. We’ve <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">removed</a> this warning.</li>\n<li><strong>No suppression of console logs:</strong> When you use Strict Mode, React renders each component twice to help you find unexpected side effects. In React 17, we’ve suppressed console logs for one of the two renders to make the logs easier to read. In response to <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/21783\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">community feedback</a> about this being confusing, we’ve removed the suppression. Instead, if you have React DevTools installed, the second log’s renders will be displayed in grey, and there will be an option (off by default) to suppress them completely.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved memory usage:</strong> React now cleans up more internal fields on unmount, making the impact from unfixed memory leaks that may exist in your application code less severe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"react-dom-server\"><a href=\"#react-dom-server\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>React DOM Server </h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">renderToString</code>:</strong> Will no longer error when suspending on the server.

In React 18, you can use <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">Suspense</code> to break down your app into smaller independent units which can be streamed independently of each other without blocking the rest of the app. This means users will see your content sooner and be able to start interacting with it much faster.</p>\n<p>For a deep dive, see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaundai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Shaundai Person</a>’s talk here:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe style=\"margin-top:10px; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pj5N-Khihgc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-first-react-working-group\"><a href=\"#the-first-react-working-group\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The first React working group </h2>\n<p>For React 18, we created our first Working Group to collaborate with a panel of experts, developers, library maintainers, and educators.

It’s called “concurrent rendering” and it lets React prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time. This change is mostly behind-the-scenes, but it unlocks new possibilities to improve both real and perceived performance of your app.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been following our research into the future of React (we don’t expect you to!), you might have heard of something called “concurrent mode” or that it might break your app. In response to this feedback from the community, we’ve redesigned the upgrade strategy for gradual adoption. Instead of an all-or-nothing “mode”, concurrent rendering will only be enabled for updates triggered by one of the new features. In practice, this means <strong>you will be able to adopt React 18 without rewrites and try the new features at your own pace.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"a-gradual-adoption-strategy\"><a href=\"#a-gradual-adoption-strategy\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A gradual adoption strategy </h2>\n<p>Since concurrency in React 18 is opt-in, there are no significant out-of-the-box breaking changes to component behavior. <strong>You can upgrade to React 18 with minimal or no changes to your application code, with a level of effort comparable to a typical major React release</strong>. Based on our experience converting several apps to React 18, we expect that many users will be able to upgrade within a single afternoon.</p>\n<p>We successfully shipped concurrent features to tens of thousands of components at Facebook, and in our experience, we’ve found that most React components “just work” without additional changes. We’re committed to making sure this is a smooth upgrade for the entire community, so today we’re announcing the React 18 Working Group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-the-community\"><a href=\"#working-with-the-community\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Working with the community </h2>\n<p>We’re trying something new for this release: We’ve invited a panel of experts, developers, library authors, and educators from across the React community to participate in our <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React 18 Working Group</a> to provide feedback, ask questions, and collaborate on the release. We couldn’t invite everyone we wanted to this initial, small group, but if this experiment works out, we hope there will be more in the future!</p>\n<p><strong>The goal of the React 18 Working Group is to prepare the ecosystem for a smooth, gradual adoption of React 18 by existing applications and libraries.</strong> The Working Group is hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Discussions</a> and is available for the public to read.

Instead, this release is primarily focused on <strong>making it easier to upgrade React itself</strong>.</p>\n<p>In particular, React 17 is a “stepping stone” release that makes it safer to embed a tree managed by one version of React inside a tree managed by a different version of React.</p>\n<p>It also makes it easier to embed React into apps built with other technologies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gradual-upgrades\"><a href=\"#gradual-upgrades\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gradual Upgrades </h2>\n<p><strong>React 17 enables gradual React upgrades.</strong> When you upgrade from React 15 to 16 (or, this time, from React 16 to 17), you would usually upgrade your whole app at once. This works well for many apps. But it can get increasingly challenging if the codebase was written more than a few years ago and isn’t actively maintained. And while it’s possible to use two versions of React on the page, until React 17 this has been fragile and caused problems with events.</p>\n<p>We’re fixing many of those problems with React 17. This means that <strong>when React 18 and the next future versions come out, you will now have more options</strong>. The first option will be to upgrade your whole app at once, like you might have done before. But you will also have an option to upgrade your app piece by piece. For example, you might decide to migrate most of your app to React 18, but keep some lazy-loaded dialog or a subroute on React 17.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean you <em>have to</em> do gradual upgrades. <strong>For most apps, upgrading all at once is still the best solution.</strong> Loading two versions of React — even if one of them is loaded lazily on demand — is still not ideal. However, for larger apps that aren’t actively maintained, this option makes sense to consider, and React 17 lets those apps not get left behind.</p>\n<p>We’ve prepared an <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-gradual-upgrade-demo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">example repository</a> demonstrating how to lazy-load an older version of React if necessary. This demo uses Create React App, but it should be possible to follow a similar approach with any other tool. We welcome demos using other tooling as pull requests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note</p>\n<p>We’ve <strong>postponed other changes</strong> until after React 17. The goal of this release is to enable gradual upgrades. If upgrading to React 17 were too difficult, it would defeat its purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"changes-to-event-delegation\"><a href=\"#changes-to-event-delegation\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Changes to Event Delegation </h2>\n<p>To enable gradual updates, we’ve needed to make some changes to the React event system. React 17 is a major release because these changes are potentially breaking. You can check out our <a href=\"/docs/faq-versioning.html#breaking-changes\">versioning FAQ</a> to learn more about our commitment to stability.</p>\n<p>In React 17, React will no longer attach event handlers at the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">document</code> level under the hood. Instead, it will attach them to the root DOM container into which your React tree is rendered:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> rootNode <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'root'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nReactDOM<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">App</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> rootNode<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In React 16 and earlier, React would do <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">document.addEventListener()</code> for most events. React 17 will call <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">rootNode.addEventListener()</code> under the hood instead.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/bb4b10114882a50090b8ff61b3c4d0fd/31868/react_17_delegation.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;

Many preconfigured toolkits like Create React App or Next.js also include a JSX transform under the hood.</p>\n<p>Together with the React 17 release, we’ve wanted to make a few improvements to the JSX transform, but we didn’t want to break existing setups. This is why we <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/blog/2020/03/16/7.9.0#a-new-jsx-transform-11154httpsgithubcombabelbabelpull11154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">worked with Babel</a> to <strong>offer a new, rewritten version of the JSX transform</strong> for people who would like to upgrade.</p>\n<p>Upgrading to the new transform is completely optional, but it has a few benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With the new transform, you can <strong>use JSX without importing React</strong>.</li>\n<li>Depending on your setup, its compiled output may <strong>slightly improve the bundle size</strong>.</li>\n<li>It will enable future improvements that <strong>reduce the number of concepts</strong> you need to learn React.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This upgrade will not change the JSX syntax and is not required.</strong> The old JSX transform will keep working as usual, and there are no plans to remove the support for it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html\">React 17 RC</a> already includes support for the new transform, so go give it a try! To make it easier to adopt, <strong>we’ve also backported its support</strong> to React 16.14.0, React 15.7.0, and React 0.14.10. You can find the upgrade instructions for different tools <a href=\"#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform\">below</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s take a closer look at the differences between the old and the new transform.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-different-in-the-new-transform\"><a href=\"#whats-different-in-the-new-transform\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What’s Different in the New Transform? </h2>\n<p>When you use JSX, the compiler transforms it into React function calls that the browser can understand. <strong>The old JSX transform</strong> turned JSX into <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">React.createElement(...)</code> calls.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say your source code looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> React <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">App</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">Hello World</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Under the hood, the old JSX transform turns it into regular JavaScript:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> React <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">App</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> React<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createElement</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'h1'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Hello world'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note</p>\n<p><strong>Your source code doesn’t need to change in any way.</strong> We’re describing how the JSX transform turns your JSX source code into the JavaScript code a browser can understand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, this is not perfect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Because JSX was compiled into <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">React.createElement</code>, <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">React</code> needed to be in scope if you used JSX.</li>\n<li>There are some <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/createlement-rfc/text/0000-create-element-changes.md#motivation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">performance improvements and simplifications</a> that <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">React.createElement</code> does not allow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To solve these issues, React 17 introduces two new entry points to the React package that are intended to only be used by compilers like Babel and TypeScript. Instead of transforming JSX to <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">React.createElement</code>, <strong>the new JSX transform</strong> automatically imports special functions from those new entry points in the React package and calls them.</p>\n<p>Let’s say that your source code looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">App</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">Hello World</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is what the new JSX transform compiles it to:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Inserted by a compiler (don't import it yourself!)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>jsx <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> _jsx<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react/jsx-runtime'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">App</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token function\">_jsx</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'h1'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">children</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Hello world'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Note how our original code <strong>did not need to import React</strong> to use JSX anymore! (But we would still need to import React in order to use Hooks or other exports that React provides.)</p>\n<p><strong>This change is fully compatible with all of the existing JSX code</strong>, so you won’t have to change your components.

The old transform will not be removed and will continue to be supported.</p>\n<p>If you want to upgrade, you will need two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A version of React that supports the new transform</strong> (<a href=\"/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html\">React 17 RC</a> and higher supports it, but we’ve also released React 16.14.0, React 15.7.0, and React 0.14.10 for people who are still on the older major versions).</li>\n<li><strong>A compatible compiler</strong> (see instructions for different tools below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the new JSX transform doesn’t require React to be in scope, <a href=\"#removing-unused-react-imports\">we’ve also prepared an automated script</a> that will remove the unnecessary imports from your codebase.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-react-app\"><a

Either you stay on an old version, or you upgrade your whole app to a new version. There was no in-between.</p>\n<p>This has worked out so far, but we are running into the limits of the “all-or-nothing” upgrade strategy. Some API changes, for example, deprecating the <a href=\"/docs/legacy-context.html\">legacy context API</a>, are impossible to do in an automated way. Even though most apps written today don’t ever use them, we still support them in React. We have to choose between supporting them in React indefinitely or leaving some apps behind on an old version of React. Both of these options aren’t great.</p>\n<p>So we wanted to provide another option.</p>\n<p><strong>React 17 enables gradual React upgrades.</strong> When you upgrade from React 15 to 16 (or, soon, from React 16 to 17), you would usually upgrade your whole app at once. This works well for many apps. But it can get increasingly challenging if the codebase was written more than a few years ago and isn’t actively maintained. And while it’s possible to use two versions of React on the page, until React 17 this has been fragile and caused problems with events.</p>\n<p>We’re fixing many of those problems with React 17. This means that <strong>when React 18 and the next future versions come out, you will now have more options</strong>. The first option will be to upgrade your whole app at once, like you might have done before. But you will also have an option to upgrade your app piece by piece. For example, you might decide to migrate most of your app to React 18, but keep some lazy-loaded dialog or a subroute on React 17.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean you <em>have to</em> do gradual upgrades. For most apps, upgrading all at once is still the best solution. Loading two versions of React — even if one of them is loaded lazily on demand — is still not ideal. However, for larger apps that aren’t actively maintained, this option may make sense to consider, and React 17 enables those apps to not get left behind.</p>\n<p>To enable gradual updates, we’ve needed to make some changes to the React event system. React 17 is a major release because these changes are potentially breaking. In practice, we’ve only had to change fewer than twenty components out of 100,000+ so <strong>we expect that most apps can upgrade to React 17 without too much trouble</strong>. <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tell us</a> if you run into problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"demo-of-gradual-upgrades\"><a href=\"#demo-of-gradual-upgrades\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Demo of Gradual Upgrades </h3>\n<p>We’ve prepared an <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-gradual-upgrade-demo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">example repository</a> demonstrating how to lazy-load an older version of React if necessary.

However, it was rather fragile because of how the React event system worked.</p>\n<p>In React components, you usually write event handlers inline:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">onClick</span><span class=\"token script language-javascript\"><span class=\"token script-punctuation punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>handleClick<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The vanilla DOM equivalent to this code is something like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\">myButton<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'click'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> handleClick<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>However, for most events, React doesn’t actually attach them to the DOM nodes on which you declare them. Instead, React attaches one handler per event type directly at the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">document</code> node. This is called <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">event delegation</a>. In addition to its performance benefits on large application trees, it also makes it easier to add new features like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1200118229697486849\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">replaying events</a>.</p>\n<p>React has been doing event delegation automatically since its first release. When a DOM event fires on the document, React figures out which component to call, and then the React event “bubbles” upwards through your components. But behind the scenes, the native event has already bubbled up to the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">document</code> level, where React installs its event handlers.</p>\n<p>However, this is a problem for gradual upgrades.</p>\n<p>If you have multiple React versions on the page, they all register event handlers at the top. This breaks <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">e.stopPropagation()</code>: if a nested tree has stopped propagation of an event, the outer tree would still receive it. This made it difficult to nest different versions of React. This concern is not hypothetical — for example, the Atom editor <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ran into this</a> four years ago.</p>\n<p>This is why we’re changing how React attaches events to the DOM under the hood.</p>\n<p><strong>In React 17, React will no longer attach event handlers at the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">document</code> level. Instead, it will attach them to the root DOM container into which your React tree is rendered:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> rootNode <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'root'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nReactDOM<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">App</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> rootNode<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In React 16 and earlier, React would do <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">document.addEventListener()</code> for most events.

Note that for this to work, both of the versions would need to be 17 or higher, which is why upgrading to React 17 is important. In a way, React 17 is a “stepping stone” release that makes next gradual upgrades feasible.</p>\n<p>This change also <strong>makes it easier to embed React into apps built with other technologies</strong>. For example, if the outer “shell” of your app is written in jQuery, but the newer code inside of it is written with React, <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">e.stopPropagation()</code> inside the React code would now prevent it from reaching the jQuery code — as you would expect. This also works in the other direction. If you no longer like React and want to rewrite your app — for example, in jQuery — you can start converting the outer shell from React to jQuery without breaking the event propagation.</p>\n<p>We’ve confirmed that <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7094\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">numerous</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8693\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">problems</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">over</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">years</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/285#issuecomment-253502585\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">on</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">our</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11530\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">issue</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tracker</a> related to integrating React with non-React code have been fixed by the new behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note</p>\n<p>You might be wondering whether this breaks <a href=\"/docs/portals.html\">Portals</a> outside of the root container.

With React 17, the propagation <em>would</em> stop (as requested!), so your <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">document</code> handlers would not fire:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\">document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'click'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// This custom handler will no longer receive clicks</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// from React components that called e.stopPropagation()</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>You can fix code like this by converting your listener to use the <a href=\"https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing#capturing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">capture phase</a>. To do this, you can pass <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">{ capture: true }</code> as the third argument to <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">document.addEventListener</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-jsx\">document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'click'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// Now this event handler uses the capture phase,</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// so it receives *all* click events below!</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">capture</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Note how this strategy is more resilient overall — for example, it will probably fix existing bugs in your code that happen when <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">e.stopPropagation()</code> is called outside of a React event handler. In other words, <strong>event propagation in React 17 works closer to the regular DOM</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-breaking-changes\"><a href=\"#other-breaking-changes\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Other Breaking Changes </h2>\n<p>We’ve kept the breaking changes in React 17 to the minimum.

The old event pooling optimization has been fully removed, so you can read the event fields whenever you need them.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a behavior change, which is why we’re marking it as breaking, but in practice we haven’t seen it break anything at Facebook.

(For the rare cases where you need an effect to block paint, e.g. to measure and position a tooltip, prefer <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">useLayoutEffect</code>.)</p>\n<p>However, when a component is unmounting, effect <em>cleanup</em> functions used to run synchronously (similar to <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">componentWillUnmount</code> being synchronous in classes). We’ve found that this is not ideal for larger apps because it slows down large screen transitions (e.g. switching tabs).</p>\n<p><strong>In React 17, the effect cleanup function always runs asynchronously — for example, if the component is unmounting, the cleanup runs <em>after</em> the screen has been updated.</strong></p>\n<p>This mirrors how the effects themselves run more closely. In the rare cases where you might want to rely on the synchronous execution, you can switch to <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">useLayoutEffect</code> instead.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note</p>\n<p>You might be wondering whether this means that you’ll now be unable to fix warnings about <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">setState</code> on unmounted components. Don’t worry — React specifically checks for this case, and does <em>not</em> fire <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">setState</code> warnings in the short gap between unmounting and the cleanup. <strong>So code cancelling requests or intervals can almost always stay the same.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, React 17 will always execute all effect cleanup functions (for all components) before it runs any new effects. React 16 only guaranteed this ordering for effects within a component.</p>\n<h4 id=\"potential-issues\"><a href=\"#potential-issues\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Potential Issues </h4>\n<p>We’ve only seen a couple of components break with this change, although reusable libraries may need to test it more thoroughly.

However, JavaScript stacks are often not enough to diagnose a problem because the React tree hierarchy can be just as important. You want to know not just that a <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">Button</code> threw an error, but <em>where in the React tree</em> that <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">Button</code> is.</p>\n<p>To solve this, React 16 started printing “component stacks” when you have an error. Still, they used to be inferior to the native JavaScript stacks. In particular, they were not clickable in the console because React didn’t know where the function was declared in the source code. Additionally, they were <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12757\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mostly useless in production</a>. Unlike regular minified JavaScript stacks which can be automatically restored to the original function names with a sourcemap, with React component stacks you had to choose between production stacks and bundle size.</p>\n<p><strong>In React 17, the component stacks are generated using a different mechanism that stitches them together from the regular native JavaScript stacks. This lets you get the fully symbolicated React component stack traces in a production environment.</strong></p>\n<p>The way React implements this is somewhat unorthodox. Currently, the browsers don’t provide a way to get a function’s stack frame (source file and location). So when React catches an error, it will now <em>reconstruct</em> its component stack by throwing (and catching) a temporary error from inside each of the components above, when it is possible. This adds a small performance penalty for crashes, but it only happens once per component type.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious, you can read more details in <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/18561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this pull request</a>, but for the most part this exact mechanism shouldn’t affect your code. From your perspective, the new feature is that component stacks are now clickable (because they rely on the native browser stack frames), and that you can decode them in production like you would with regular JavaScript errors.</p>\n<p>The part that constitutes a breaking change is that for this to work, React re-executes parts of some of the React functions and React class constructors above in the stack after an error is captured. Since render functions and class constructors shouldn’t have side effects (which is also important for server rendering), this should not pose any practical problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removing-private-exports\"><a href=\"#removing-private-exports\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Removing Private Exports </h3>\n<p>Finally, the last notable breaking change is that we’ve removed some React internals that were previously exposed to other projects. In particular, <a href=\"https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React Native for Web</a> used to depend on some internals of the event system, but that dependency was fragile and used to break.</p>\n<p><strong>In React 17, these private exports have been removed. As far as we’re aware, React Native for Web was the only project using them, and they have already completed a migration to a different approach that doesn’t depend on those private exports.</strong></p>\n<p>This means that the older versions of React Native for Web won’t be compatible with React 17, but the newer versions will work with it. In practice, this doesn’t change much because React Native for Web had to release new versions to adapt to internal React changes anyway.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we’ve removed the <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">ReactTestUtils.SimulateNative</code> helper methods. They have never been documented, didn’t do quite what their names implied, and didn’t work with the changes we’ve made to the event system. If you want a convenient way to fire native browser events in tests, check out the <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React Testing Library</a> instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installation\"><a href=\"#installation\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0

This release adds that behaviour to <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code>. This shouldn’t affect most code, unless you have side effects in <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">shouldComponentUpdate</code>. To fix this, move the code with side effects into <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">componentDidUpdate</code>.</li>\n<li>In Strict Development Mode, the warnings for usage of the legacy context API didn’t include the stack for the component that triggered the warning. This release adds the missing stack to the warning.</li>\n<li><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">onMouseEnter</code> now doesn’t trigger on disabled <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">&lt;button></code> elements.</li>\n<li>ReactDOM was missing a <code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">version</code> export since we published v16. This release adds it back.
