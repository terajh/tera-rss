    "partialText": "<p>In this article, I argue that AI-assisted coding is useful but overhyped. I see real value in speeding up boilerplate and first drafts, but I also see serious risks: weaker developer fundamentals, more technical debt, shallow productivity metrics, security and licensing concerns, and growing pressure on open source maintainers. My core point is simple: AI can help me write code faster, but it still doesnâ€™t solve the hardest part of software engineering - building the right systems that stay reliable, secure, and maintainable over time.</p>",

Dan Abramov describes a technique for streaming JSON from a server to a client in chunks, allowing the client to start rendering parts of the data before the entire payload has been received. This can significantly improve perceived performance, especially for large datasets. So, I started wondering how much of an effort it would be to implement something like that.

The router is the front office that accepts the request to particular URL and wires it to a logic. Logic for generating HTML or JSON response or something else. So, the router is very important part of your system.</p>\n<p>At the end of last year I rewrote one of my favorite projects - a vanilla JS router called <a href=\"https://github.com/krasimir/navigo\">Navigo</a>. I was procrastinating this work for years. Finally I did it in TypeScript and wrote 100+ unit tests along the way. This refactoring opens the door for new features and more importantly, for integrating the library into other places. Like React for example.</p>",
