    "title": "Unhandled Promise Rejections: The Tiny Mistake That Crashed Our Node.js App",
    "partialText": "<p>Imagine deploying a Node.js backend service that works flawlessly in development, only to have it mysteriously crash in production. Everything ran fine on your laptop, but on the live server, the process keeps shutting down unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>In our case, the culprit was a single unhandled promise rejection — one missing <code data-end=\"410\" data-start=\"400\">.catch()</code> in our code caused Node to exit abruptly whenever an error occurred. That one “tiny” mistake made the difference between a stable service and frequent downtime. In this article, we’ll explore how a misconfigured error handling in a Node/Express API can bring down an application, and how to diagnose and fix it to prevent future crashes.</p><img src=\"https://feeds.dzone.com/link/23564/17192940.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",

    "title": "Stop React Native Crashes: A Production-Ready Error Handling Guide",
    "partialText": "<p>You are demonstrating your next mobile application idea to investors, and suddenly the application crashes. Now you are clueless whether it crashed due to bad WIFI at the venue, your service is down, or your application itself hit a snag. There are no logs or alerts to tell you what just happened. Mere imagination of this scenario can send any founder or developer into panic and nervousness. Therefore, having robust error handling is critical to modern-day mobile applications. React Native has become an industry standard in building cross-platform native mobile applications. React Native boasts a rich ecosystem of error handling at various levels of architecture.</p>\n<p>However, often projects lack clear guidelines on how to handle various error scenarios. This results in either overdoing or underdoing error handling in otherwise robust and feature-rich applications. In this article, you will learn how to adopt a three-layer error handling mechanism, which is gaining widespread popularity with major enterprise-level applications built at leading companies. The article will give you a practical guide instead of pure theory, so you are ready to adapt these concepts immediately.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://feeds.dzone.com/link/23564/17183111.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
