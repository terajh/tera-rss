        &lt;p&gt;This blog post is co-written with Alexandra White and Matthias Rohmer In our experience, working in many different companies and contexts, there are – very broadly speaking and quite simplified – four types of people you will come across during your working life. For me, at least, being able to identify these archetypes has helped [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The year was 1983. I was 9 years old. I used to visit my paternal grandmother who lived in the city, and every time I came by she would take me to the movies, which was wonderful! It was the time when I learned to love both movies and cinemas. This time around, she told [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to share my view on it here, and what I think it encompasses. Last year I gave a presentation called &amp;#34;Have you tried listening?&amp;#34; (video) [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, back in the time when there were announcers telling you which the next program on TV would be, you knew it would be good if they said: &amp;#34;We&amp;#39;d like to warn sensitive viewers that next program might upset you&amp;#34;.

        &lt;p&gt;When I got started with blogging back in 2005, I had been an interface developer for the web since 1999. The big challenges back in 2005 were convincing developers and companies to make sure that things worked in more than one web browser, and that JavaScript wasn&amp;#39;t evil and actually pretty competent. And now, in [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Having spent almost 20 years working on the web, it is something I strongly believe and am invested in. Therefore, when I see or am part of initiatives that I think will help developers and the web platform out there, it makes me very excited! And last week I got very reminded about how good [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One million kilometers. That&amp;#39;s a pretty long distance. Going through my travel statistics recently, I discovered that is how much I&amp;#39;ve traveled during the last few years. This is what the overall stats look like: 698 days of traveling 1,126,866 km 48 countries 109 cities 117 trips I&amp;#39;ve been extremely fortunate to get the opportunity [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been following the stories on #MeToo, listening and talking to a lot of people, and have been trying to gather my thoughts. First, no one should ever have to feel unsafe. Ever. I&amp;#8217;m so saddened to hear all the stories and testimonies, women being treated unfairly, as less worthy or as just being there [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
