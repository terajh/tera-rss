      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week the next major release of Kirby, Version 4 saw the light of day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A while back I came across a post on Mastodon that mentioned the beta version of Kirby 4 being very stable already. I gave it a shot and started using it. I dint’t run into any issues and have gotten used to the new panel design so quickly, I really like it. There are lots of other improvements and Kirby just keeps on getting better and better. &lt;br&gt;Huge congratulations to the team for taking Kirby to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://getkirby.com/releases/4.0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;what’s new&lt;/a&gt; or treat yourself to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://getkirby.com/buy&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;new license&lt;/a&gt; with their current promotion. I’m looking forward to easily upgrade existing projects to enjoy the new interface. Onwards and upwards! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coming Thursday Bastian willl also talk with Marc about Kirby 4 on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://beyondtellerrand.com/stay-curious/kirby-4-release&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Stay Curious&lt;/a&gt; “Kirby release podcast” issue. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today on this glorious early winter day, a note showed up in my calendar. A little reminder on how quickly time flies, when you’re having fun. Or at least when one has a lot of things going on. The real reason for that calendar note was to remind me to write something on this site. As I don’t want to be called out on it, I take this as a good reason to start today. This site needs a little dusting, but I’m kinda looking forward to write again. But hey, now I did write something! :) &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Usually I&apos;m not a huge fan of such libraries, as we mostly create our own to match a certain illustration style and appearance, yet in some cases it can be a useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

        A collection of free single-purpose online tools for web developers  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;started and curated by Stefan Judis plus many of other people from the community. It’s a lovely project and it indeed lists lots of useful tools from A as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tiny-helpers.dev/accessibility/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/a&gt; to V as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tiny-helpers.dev/videos/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Videos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worth checking out, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stefanjudis/tiny-helpers#contributing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/a&gt; your own favorite tools to the pot. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic-reading.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bionic Reading&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and their reading mode in the below example makes reading of the text block incredibly easier and a lot faster. The wonders of how our brains work. Bionic Reading offers an API to convert texts, and I’m thinking if it would be a good idea to add this to pages with longer texts. It could either work as a plugin (in my case for Kirby) or an on-page toggle, so users can opt-out in case they perfer otherwise. The latter would probably be the better idea. I’d be interested to hear what other people think about it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;overflow&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Quite a read on the NFT crypto space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
        A man sits at his computer and types out the story he has fabricated for the Fame Lady Squad NFT project: “we wanted to create an image of a strong and independent woman of the NFT community.” The project draws in $1.5 million from buyers, who talk of their excitement when they found a project they felt was bringing diversity to an overwhelmingly male space, and that was “all about women’s empowerment”. They later find out that the “all-female led project” created by “Cindy”, “Kelda”, and “Andrea” was in fact created by a group of three white men.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The above and more in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mollywhite.net/predatory-community/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;full article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CSS Contextual Spacing</title>

        &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://moderncss.dev/contextual-spacing-for-intrinsic-web-design&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Contextual Spacing For Intrinsic Web Design&lt;/a&gt; Stephanie Eckles talks about properties and functions for intrinsic design, which allow you to do some really nice things. You can get rid of using some of your media queries. There are quite a few examples of new properties and functions that, when used properly, will make your code a little prettier, a little more modern and a little more fun, because new ;) One of my favorite examples in this article is the following code, which basically can serve as your new version for a centered container (wrapper) class, spacing included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;.container {
        width: min(100vw - 3rem, 80ch);
        margin-inline: auto;
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Below you can find the slightly more advanced rule which uses a CSS custom property with the &lt;code&gt;80ch&lt;/code&gt; value from above as the fallback, in case custom properties are not supported. Pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;.container {
        width: min(100vw - 3rem, var(--container-max, 80ch) );
        margin-inline: auto;
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So far I haven&apos;t worked much with &lt;code&gt;clamp()&lt;/code&gt; and friends yet, but this definitely is something to pack into the toolbox for 2022. I usually don&apos;t mind writing media queries, but I’m always game to reduce some of the code required, even if only for convenience. Worth a look at.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This thought has been triggered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://scribe.rip/@fosta/on-design-thinking-8426ecf328b3&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;On Design Thinking&lt;/a&gt;, an article with great points on where good design for the web has gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
        It [Design Thinking] sold out Design in an attempt to impress those in power, and in so doing lost its heart.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One thing I notice frequently is that a lot of clients are reluctant to be open and sign off on new, creative ideas, or unconventional ways of designing. There are many ways of how we can design and build things for the web, yet people want to stick with what they know. The things everyone uses for their site. Hamburger menus. Carousels. Modals. Many others. The things that have been confirmed as “working well” by the mass market. They offer security, the safety net of “so many people can’t be wrong”. This is an unfortunate fact, because there are lots of ways how things on the web could be better and less boring. Unfortunately the majority often isn’t right, they go with what they can find, out on the cheap and free design template market. As a result, the opinions on what’s best practice get skewed. Just because one solution works for one, doesn’t mean it will work as well for another.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As developers (who are constantly learning and “operating” in the bubble) we are so far ahead of the curve. One of many such examples is that recently a friend told me about dark mode and how it apparently is the latest trend. When we built Colloq some time ago, we implemented dark mode, which back then was pretty much hot off the press and we wanted to try it out.  There are many more of such examples. Showed me again how far ahead of the mainstream curve we are. This is likely the reason that often (most of the time??) it can difficult to explain to people, clients, friends what’s going on in our, or particularly in my head in regards to the web. The knowledge gap exists and it can only be bridged with good communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I have remotely “attended” the second day of &lt;a href=&quot;https://btconf.de&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Beyond Tellerrand Conference&lt;/a&gt; and it’s been fun. Obviously I would have preferred to attend in person, as this was the first edition in two years, but for many reasons, I can’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.matuzo.at&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Manuel Matuzović&lt;/a&gt;’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/dusseldorf-2022/speakers/manuel-matuzovic&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lost in Translation&lt;/a&gt;” has been absolutely great and was packed with great insights and a lot of hard truths. I’m glad I caught it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webrocker.de&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; wrote down a few of his thoughts on this talk. These indeed are questions that have been on my mind for a long time, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
        I don&apos;t want to spoil too much, but one of the reasons he sees is the gap between &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Development&quot;, to put it simply.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &quot;(visual) design&quot; -&amp;gt; understanding what structure this implies -&amp;gt; translating this into the correct HTML -&amp;gt; &quot;development&quot;“  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I recommend to give “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webrocker.de/2022/05/04/when-youre-invisible/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;… when you&apos;re invisible&lt;/a&gt;” a read. &lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is a really great read, of which a lot and then some, resonated with me so much. Many people are scared of getting older, but it’s actually not that bad, because in the process, we’re gaining more and more experience. Whether that’s professional or general life experience, I personally like it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article with 103 bits of advice is a great read and it has many nuggets in it that I would like to incorporate into my life, if I’m not trying to do that thing already. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another one that I would like to add to the list, which has been proven well is the concept of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foobartel.com/notes/going-first&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;going first&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read and see for yourself: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I had added a new TIL section to this site, which later turned into TILRS (today I learned, remember, share). I liked it a lot, and I posted all kinds of things in this section. Yet this led to the Notes section becoming more and more neglected and quite often I had difficulties to decide which post should go where. It’s been bugging me for too long and as a result, it had to be changed. I also got a bit bored with my site and this change shall be the starting point of more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have now removed the TILRS section and from today onwards, all posts will be published under Notes, unless the post is a long-form Article. For the notes I&apos;m planning that those can be many types, whether a single picture, gallery, a quote or short text, opinion, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;note /nəʊt/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. a brief record of points or ideas written down as an aid to memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I would like to display all these different records in a different format and design, so things will get a bit more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the old /tilrs URLs did get a redirect to their new location under Notes, so none of the old links will break. By now my .htaccess file  looks like a huge redirection list, carrying the redirects from various changes including the move from WordPress to Kirby from back in the days. No problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/tilrs&lt;/code&gt; feed has also been redirected and for now, &lt;code&gt;/stream/feed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/feed&lt;/code&gt; will be the combined feeds and they are announced on all pages. Subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://foobartel.com/feed&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt;, for some better reading and to not miss any future posts! :) &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is a neat site that offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensourcealternative.to/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;open source alternatives&lt;/a&gt; to a lot of proprietary SaaS tools. I just tried it out; as I’m in the rather slow (and non-urgent) process of finding a new password manager and indeed, it did show a few options that I haven’t heard of yet. Definitely worth trying out if you are looking for alternative tools to replace some of what you are using.

        &lt;p&gt;February, 2nd, 2022. A special day. A palindrome day. All twos. I couldn’t pass up on the opportunity to write a short post on this special date. Kinda fun. It’s also a good opportunity to start to write again, as in the last few weeks all my good intentions of writing more frequently went quickly down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of fairly little work load, it suddenly got super busy, as it always happens. This is a good problem to have. Yet, for as long as I can think, it’s always either one of the two: super quiet or really busy. Some time in the future I will need to work on better planning, or rather on keeping the planning as it was supposed to work. This time the main issue is a project, where at first everything stalled, then it needs to get finished soon, as it’s not helping the rest of my timeline. Stuff like this happens once in a while and maybe it needs to be that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blogging frequently is so much harder than one would think and here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/brain-food/february-20-2022/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tiny Thought &lt;/a&gt;from FS that touches exactly on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news, Hong Kong is currently experiencing what the rest of the world has seen a year or more ago and we’re in sort of a (soft) lockdown, which today has been extended until mid to end of April. As we all know, it’s not much fun. At least it allows me to get a lot of work done, with little to no major distractions. This too shall pass and we’ll see what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the worrying and unpleasant things going on in the world right now, I want to end with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/brain-food/february-13-2022/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
        We have to be willing to confront the world as it is, not as we want it to be if we’re going to be successful.    &lt;footer&gt;

        Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all to make informed decisions.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A great resource for developers to find and compare as-a-service software of all kinds that include free tiers. It’s a massively long list of things, and it’s pretty incredible that we have all these affordable/free things at our hands nowadays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://free-for.dev/#/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Free-for-Dev&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Better Text Decoration With CSS’ text-underline-offset</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/notes/css-text-underline-offset</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/notes/css-text-underline-offset</guid>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;I recently came across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;text-underline-offset&lt;/a&gt; CSS property and I’m really surprised that I wasn’t aware that this fairly new property existed. There have been many times in the past where I wanted some more spacing between the characters and the underline and in many cases, I would then fall back on &lt;code&gt;border-bottom&lt;/code&gt; in combination with a little bottom padding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been putting this newly found, little helper into good use a few times recently, and it feels like a great improvement. Not only does it improve the visual look, but I find that it makes the underlined word, which is mostly a link, much more legible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how &lt;code&gt;text-underline-offset&lt;/code&gt; looks like in action: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;.example1 {
        text-decoration: underline;
        text-underline-offset: auto;
        }
        
        .example2 {
        text-decoration: underline;
        text-underline-offset: 0.2em;
        }
        
        .example3 {
        text-decoration: underline;
        text-decoration-thickness: 0.25em;
        text-decoration-color: darkseagreen;
        text-underline-offset: 0.125em;
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example1&quot;&gt;Ex 1: The fairy loved to dance on top of underlined letters&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example2&quot;&gt;Ex 2: Other times it was possible to crawl between the offset&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example3&quot;&gt;Ex 3: A solid underline made sure she would never fall and disappear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not aware of any special guidance of &lt;code&gt;text-underline-offset&lt;/code&gt; in terms of accessibility, but it serves as a nice addition to make text links a little more legible and easier on the eye, at least for some font choices, especially at small font sizes. Other than that, it also allows for some nice, creative possibilities to make things look a little more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starship Prompt - Displaying the GIT Branch in Terminal</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/notes/starship-prompt</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/notes/starship-prompt</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since Apple released macOS Catalina in 2019 and changed the default shell to zsh across its operating system, I’ve been meaning to follow this move and change my default shell from the good old bash to zsh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With my current setup, I used a few lines from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdo/config/blob/main/.bash_profile&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this profile&lt;/a&gt; to display the current git branch with the prompt. I never took the time to do some research and look into the topic, because all things shell is clearly not my comfort zone. Hence I also never found out how easy it could have been to get the same setup with zsh as I had all that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that showing the git branch in Terminal is quite a common thing to do nowadays. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/foobartel/status/1481968496322162691&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and got some helpful pointers, and off I went into shell land. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://starship.rs&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Starship prompt&lt;/a&gt;, which works cross-shell, and with that I’m now running zsh as my default shell, inclusive of displaying the current git branch. Starship has a lot of options for configuration and you can easily pick the ones you need and like. It has a good documentation that without much time required, allowed me to add the options I wanted. After all, this wasn’t as scary or difficult as initially assumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
        I’ve switched my prompt to starship a few years ago and have found that largely eliminated any motivation to switch to zsh lol    &lt;footer&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wong_jim/status/1483107748019589131&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/wong_jim/status/1483107748019589131&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/footer&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That said, I’ve been doing fine with bash all those years and don’t use the shell to an extend that I’d notice all the advantages, but at least I got rid of the constant reminder of the new default shell and it feels like I’m up to date again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also found two more links that do the same without any additional tools, in case this is your cup of tea:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/pareture/simplest-zsh-prompt-configs-for-git-branch-name-3d01602a6f33&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Simplest ZSH Prompt Configs for Git Branch Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/reinvanoyen/05bcfe95ca9cb5041a4eafd29309ff29&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Add Git Branch Name to Terminal Prompt (MacOS Catalina zsh)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        Unlike many parts of CSS, Flexible box layout or Flexbox can be difficult to understand just by using it. It wasn&apos;t until this most recent update of CSS Master that I even sort of grokked it.1 I hope to untangle its mysteries in this post.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The super-comprehensive explainer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://webinista.com/updates/how-does-flexbox-work/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;how flexbox works&lt;/a&gt;. Likely lots to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I read a fair bit of blogs via RSS, for which I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://betamagic.nl/products/newsexplorer.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;News Explorer&lt;/a&gt; on macOS and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When swiping through the articles or looking at the list of blogs in its sidebar, sometimes it’s difficult to know the author/source of an article, because it has an ~&lt;s&gt;arbitrary&lt;/s&gt;~ non-specific RSS page title. As an example, a title of “RSS feed of all posts” unfortunately doesn’t say much at all and could pretty much be every blog out there (with an RSS feed!). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (and probably everyone else?) prefer when your name, the name of the blog or its URL are included in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of the XML document. Most of the time, this should be the template default, but I sometimes come across a few, where it constantly confuses me, that I can’t at a glance make out at who it’s from what I’m reading. Especially when I like it ;) &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Good Read: NFTs are so, so dumb</title>

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        Like most of what’s ruined the internet, NFTs started as a good idea. When the concept was demoed in 2014, it was presented as a way for digital artists to easily sell and control their work. But the market has been flooded by grifters who exploit artists, or who just sell NFTs of an artist’s work without telling them.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As with all of the articles about Web3, NFTs, crypto et al, this one is opinionated as well, but it is a) very fun and entertaining to read and b) IMO does have some good points. I have a lot of thoughts on the whole new Web3 thingy, but currently just don‘t want to find the time to write about it. This year shall be about more positivity, so enjoy this fun read for now, with the bickering saved for later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‘m actually linking to a humor site, and I swear I haven‘t been on one of those in years. I haven‘t missed them either. 2022, here we come! 🙃&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full piece on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cracked.com/article_31914_nfts-are-so-so-dumb.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NFTs Are So, So Dumb&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Finding the Currently Focused Element</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/notes/current-focus</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/notes/current-focus</guid>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;When doing accessibility audits (or even daily web use), too often I come across sites that are missing focus styles. When navigating via keyboard, it can be difficult to see which element you are currently on and hence, lose sight of where you are on a page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quickly find the currently focused element, we can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/activeElement&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;activeElement&lt;/a&gt; read-only property of the &lt;code&gt;Document&lt;/code&gt; interface. Despite its rather confusing name, it does return the focused element. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use it, open the DevTools Console (cmd + i, then ESC, or click the Console tab) and type the following, short command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;document.activeElement;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This will give you an instant preview of the focused element name. Press Enter and Console will expand the output and return the currently focused element, including its content. You can then hover the Console output to see the highlighted element in the browser window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you are styling &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#interactive_content&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;focusable elements&lt;/a&gt;, aka links, buttons or form fields, it‘s a great idea to take the extra time to add visible &lt;code&gt;:focus&lt;/code&gt; styles. It can also look great and will show the care of your craft. It will make navigating pages more usable and enjoyable, especially when relying on visible focus styles for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mmatuzo/status/1478027778184429568?s=21&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mmatuzo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Manuel Matuzo&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, it‘s possible to tie &lt;code&gt;document.activeElement&lt;/code&gt; to Chrome DevTools &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/live-expressions/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Live Expressions&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to log the current element automatically when changed. Makes a lot of sense when you think about, but I was not aware that this feature exists. Since Chrome 70. Very helpful indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start using Live Expressions, click the eye button (outlined below) under the Console tab, type your expression and start focus tabbing away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The start of the year has been a very relaxing one this year, especially convenient with the second day being a Sunday. It should always be like that! We‘re also very lucky with the weather these days, and besides the unfortunate amount of air pollution, it‘s been stunning. Today we had dim sum lunch by the beach, followed by a short walk around the bay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I want this year to be more creative, more honest, more wild, more daring, more fun, more beatiful, more challenging and more rewarding. Onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;

        You are here because you are somehow interested in what the “Web3” or “NFT” thing is about. Maybe someone gave you this link, maybe you follow me somewhere. In this document I’ll try to explain what those terms mean, what ideas and politics they are based on and what I think about them. I will do my best to represent the Web3/NFT ideas as fairly as possible but for transparency’s sake I should note that I am not a fan.    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a good article that explains some of the Web3 concepts, how things do or don‘t work. Definitely worth reading to get a better understanding of the various parts involved, to then form–or expand on–your own opinions about the recent hype of Web3 and all that comes with it.. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find the complete article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tante.cc/2021/12/17/the-third-web/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;tante.cc&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Bartender is a small macOS app that‘s “&lt;em&gt;giving you total control over your menu bar items, what&apos;s displayed, and when, with menu bar items only showing when you need them.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite a nice idea, and especially convenient when you have a lot of items in the menu bar which clash with the application menus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macbartender.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.macbartender.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

      <title>The CSS :has() pseudo-class, aka Parent Selector</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/notes/the-css-has-pseudo-class</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/notes/the-css-has-pseudo-class</guid>

      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;Just in time for the holidays, the CSS &lt;code&gt;:has()&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-class has arrived in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Safari technology preview 137&lt;/a&gt;, enabled by default. Cool beans! Everybody is pretty excited about this announcement, because it&apos;s basically been “…parent selector is not possible…” for a long time and now we‘re like “Cool, the impossible parent selector has actually arrived in CSSland!”. Who would have thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally I&apos;m excited about &lt;code&gt;:has()&lt;/code&gt;, which I believe will change the way I (or we?) will write CSS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;/* Selects any &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; element, as long as it directly contains an &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; element */
        a:has(&amp;gt; img) {
        border: 1px solid pink;
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://foobartel.com/media/pages/notes/the-css-has-pseudo-class/d9119a2145-1650440772/foobartel-com-example-css-has-1200x-q60.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;
        The result of the above line of CSS used on the homepage of this site (Safari TP 137)	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While being able to select parent elements is a rather big deal, I‘m as much excited about the possibilities to check for certain element combinations and the different styling options thereof. I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bramus/status/1473429865932238848?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this example&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;:has()&lt;/code&gt; for form labels and nested/unnested input elements, a typical use case with text fields, checkboxes or radio buttons: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;/* &amp;lt;input&amp;gt; element nested within the &amp;lt;label&amp;gt; */
        label:has(&amp;gt; input) {
        &amp;hellip;
        }
        
        /* the &amp;lt;label&amp;gt; element followed by &amp;lt;input&amp;gt; */
        label:has(+ input) {
        &amp;hellip;
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In combination with &lt;code&gt;:is()&lt;/code&gt; which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://fooabrtel.com/tilrs/the-new-css-is-pseudo-class&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;wrote about before&lt;/a&gt;, it‘ll make a nice selector team for future CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‘s been some time that something new has arrived where I thought that it will change the approach of writing CSS. Maybe the last big thing that did that were media queries in 2010? Anyways, it‘ll still be a little while until &lt;code&gt;:has()&lt;/code&gt; will have good browser support, but implementations happen much faster these days, so let‘s see when it will become a daily tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information and examples on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bram.us/2021/12/21/the-css-has-selector-is-way-more-than-a-parent-selector/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bram.us&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

      <title>iOS 15, AirPods Pro and the Boy Who Cried Wolf</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/notes/ios-15-airpods-pro-notification</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/notes/ios-15-airpods-pro-notification</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;Since upgrading to iOS 15 (at first running the beta, now official 15.2), I frequently receive a notification that my AirPods have been left behind at a previous location. Yet every time I see this notification, my AirPods are always near, which is mostly in my pocket, on my desk or even in my ear. &lt;br&gt;While I think this feature is a great addition to iOS–I like it a lot–and it will likely save many people from loosing their trusted pods, it’s a “dangerous” bug to be had. I usually get used to such notifications, start to ignore them, which in this particular case could eventually lead to losing them for real one day. I really do hope that this will never be the case though! Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
        &lt;source srcset=&quot;https://foobartel.com/media/pages/notes/ios-15-airpods-pro-notification/d537b1d5c1-1650440762/0866c2c7-f13e-40fe-a117-d202b8df04b6-400x-q60.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://foobartel.com/media/pages/notes/ios-15-airpods-pro-notification/d537b1d5c1-1650440762/0866c2c7-f13e-40fe-a117-d202b8df04b6-400x-q55.png&quot; alt=&quot;iOS lock screen showing notifications on AirPods left behind and AirPods connected at the same time&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; &gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
        
        &lt;figcaption&gt;
        This is what the bug looks like in action, sometimes diplaying the “left behind”-notice, even though the AirPods are connected.	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard from others that this problem might occur because of low batteries of the AirPods, but that is not the case for me. So far I did not find a way to remedy the issue. Hopefully this bug will get fixed in the future, so this feature will turn into a useful and reliable helper. Until then: Don’t lose your AirPods, whatever you do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;small&gt;In case you aren’t familiar with the story of the boy who cried wolf, you can learn about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheBoyWhoCriedWolf&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unregistering a Service Worker</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/notes/unregistering-a-serviceworker</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/notes/unregistering-a-serviceworker</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;After some time, I eventually managed to unregister my service worker on this site, because I kept on running into &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; issues with &lt;a href=&quot;https://getkirby.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kirby&lt;/a&gt;’s panel API. I could not figure out what the exact issue was, so for now there won’t be any offline functionality anymore, but the panel will be working without problems for me again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://love2dev.com/blog/how-to-uninstall-a-service-worker/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/unregister&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; helped me fix it, after I didn&apos;t manage to get it done at first try a few weeks ago. The final code block looks like this and went into the the footer of my site, instead of the registration of the same. The stumbling block for me was how to get to the registration of the current service worker, which &lt;code&gt;navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()&lt;/code&gt; returns. The script now unregisters the existing service worker from every visitor who had it previously installed, once they visit this site again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;if (&amp;#039;serviceWorker&amp;#039; in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().
        then( function(registrations) {
        for(let registration of registrations) {
        registration.unregister();
        }
        })
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s a good idea to put things aside when you can’t get it done and revisit them later. Most of the time, the second attempt works much better and faster for me, since in the meantime the unconscious has pretty much done all the heavy lifting 😄&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding a JavaScript Event Handler (with addEventListener) to Multiple Elements</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/articles/eventlistener-multiple-elements</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/articles/eventlistener-multiple-elements</guid>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;There are a variety of use cases for when you might want to add an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;EventListener&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/a&gt; to an element to change its native behaviour. Sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;event handlers&lt;/a&gt; need to get attached to single elements, other times adding to multiple elements at once can be neccessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time when I do need to add it to multiple elements, I can’t remember… This post serves as a little reminder for myself (and possibly you), in case I forget again, which is pretty surely going to happen. And that’s ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding an EventListener to a single element that is listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;click event&lt;/a&gt; often looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;document.querySelector(&amp;#039;.button&amp;#039;).addEventListener(&amp;#039;click&amp;#039;, event =&amp;gt; {
        // do something on click
        });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet sometimes you want to add an EventListener to multiple elements. This can be helpful when you want to execute the same function on different elements, e.g. each with its own parameter, option, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to add an Event Listener to multiple elements is by using the convenience of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;for…of&lt;/a&gt; statement, which creates a loop to iterate over its passed elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;let buttons = document.querySelectorAll(&amp;#039;.button&amp;#039;);
        
        for(i of buttons) {
        i.addEventListener(&amp;#039;click&amp;#039;, function() {
        // do something on click
        });
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another way to add an EventListener to multiple elements is by using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;forEach()&lt;/a&gt; loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;querySelectorAll()&lt;/code&gt; we’re selecting all elements with the &lt;code&gt;.button&lt;/code&gt; class, then we iterate over all of these elements with  &lt;code&gt;forEach()&lt;/code&gt; and add the EventListener (for the ‘click’ event) to each of them. The code to do so looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;document.querySelectorAll(&amp;#039;.button&amp;#039;).forEach(item =&amp;gt; {
        item.addEventListener(&amp;#039;click&amp;#039;, event =&amp;gt; {
        // do something on click
        });
        });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For situations where elements do not have the same class name, but require the same EventListener, it’s possible to create an array to select all elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;[document.querySelector(&amp;#039;.button&amp;#039;), document.querySelector(&amp;#039;.other-element&amp;#039;)].forEach(item =&amp;gt; {
        item.addEventListener(&amp;#039;click&amp;#039;, event =&amp;gt; {
        // do something on click
        });
        });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By now and with the above examples, you (and my future self) should have a good idea on the different possibilities of how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/a&gt; on multiple elements. With that, go build something and have a nice day! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please reach out if you have any comments or further improvements to the above snippets. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Custom CSS Reset</title>

        &lt;p&gt;A nice and simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;reset for CSS defaults&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty similar to the very few CSS resets I am using these days. As a personal preference I‘m not removing the margin on all elements, since I prefer to tweak it when required. Embrace the defaults!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am now thinking to add removed margins &amp;amp; padding for &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt;, since this is something that I almost always touch to restyle, so it absolutely makes for a good candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For simplified &lt;code&gt;line-height&lt;/code&gt; calculations across various elements Josh mentioned trying to use &lt;code&gt;calc&lt;/code&gt; . It‘s a quick and simple way to get good &lt;code&gt;line-height&lt;/code&gt; default values set. Yet in my opinion and for my own work (and depending on the typeface), I find it not specific enough and I‘d usually overwrite it for most elements either way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many situations it will work, so it is definitely worth trying out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;* {
        line-height: 1.5;
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        Instead of calculating the line height by &lt;em&gt;multiplying&lt;/em&gt; the font-size with a number like 1.5, this alternative uses the font-size as a base, and &lt;em&gt;adds&lt;/em&gt; a fixed amount of space to each line.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;* {
        line-height: calc(1em + 0.5rem);
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Tool Tip: Syncthing</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/notes/syncthing</link>

        &lt;p&gt;When Dropbox launched in 2007, it was the tool that everyone had been waiting for. Simple file and folder synchronisation between different computers made easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time and like so many others, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropbox.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; have added many more features, and I started to like it less and less. For a while I used to pay for the product, yet stopped at some point, mainly because I didn&apos;t need much storage space or used it as much anymore. Some privacy concerns did play into this decision, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I’m still using it, but am not paying for a subscription anymore. Space is limited and I sometimes run into storage limitations, which can sometimes be a little inconvenient. During our time working on the now defunct Colloq, Tobias introduced us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://syncthing.net&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Syncthing&lt;/a&gt;, which we’ve used for internal file sharing. Syncthing used to be a little complicated to get up and running, but since then has improved and quick to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;get up and running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syncthing does a great job of synching files and folders with different computers, without the middle man of the “cloud”. It doesn’t serve as a “backup” solution, since it only synchronises files on different machines, without storing files in the cloud. Once a file is deleted, it will be removed from all other machines, if synchronised. This makes for a great deal of privacy, if you’re into that kinda thing ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Private.&lt;/strong&gt; None of your data is ever stored anywhere else other than on your computers. There is no central server that might be compromised, legally or illegally.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For small teams or simple computer to computer file sharing, Syncthing is a great alternative to Dropbox. It comes as a free, open source, secure and simple piece of software. Its file size limitations are those of the machines that you are synchronising, not what a subscription plan allows. It does exactly what I got from Dropbox in the early days. One thing, namely synchronisation, done well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-ratio=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

      <title>Return to Alfred</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some software and tools do come and go all the time. Sometimes they return and make a second, or even third appearance in /Applications. After using Alfred.app for years, reduced down in its feature set to only opening applications, I ditched it for macOS’ built-in Spotlight search, which worked just as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the upgrade to macOS Monterey, Spotlight somehow became so slow, that it’s not convenient anymore. After pressing cmd + space bar and starting to type the application name, the first result quickly shows, but disappears as quickly again. After that it takes a few seconds for the results list to show up. Most of the time, the first result is the correct one, but in cases where it’s not, it is an interruption to my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So today, I went back to using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;, which instantly displays a full list of results, much faster than Spotlight. Let’s see if I’ll also make use of some of the other features that come with it more often than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that Spotlight isn’t caching anything, which I think it should. I rebuilt the Spotlight index already, which did not make any difference. If you have any pointers on how to speed it up again, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Replicating Kirby content with rsync and cron</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/articles/replicating-kirby-content-with-rsync-and-cron</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/articles/replicating-kirby-content-with-rsync-and-cron</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;For all of my Kirby projects the content folder usually is excluded from the Git repository, and hence the content does not get deployed with new releases. To create a development preview that always features the latest content from the production site, I recently set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;cron job&lt;/a&gt; that replicates the Kirby content directory from its production location to the develop environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a simple one-liner which makes working with the development site more convenient, because any new features or bugfixes can be previewed and tested with the latest content from the live site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the replication to happen, I’m using a simple shell script which then gets called via a cron job at a certain time interval. I think case I’m running the script once a day, but it’s possible to tweak the cron job interval to your own liking and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To copy the content folder I’m using &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://rsync.samba.org/documentation.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;), which is an open-source utility for transferring and synchronizing files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple syntax for the command is: &lt;code&gt;rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [DEST]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since cron will be calling the &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; command as a shell script, the script starts with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@codingmaths/bin-bash-what-exactly-is-this-95fc8db817bf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;hashbang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To copy the complete &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; directory with all of its content, it&apos;s required to use the &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;--recursive&lt;/code&gt; to recurse into directories) option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete script then looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh rsync -r /production.domain.tld/content /develop.domain.tld/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The last step then is to save the script on the server (e.g. as “replicate-content.sh”), set its permissions to be executable and call it with a cron job. Many hosting plans come with an interface to create and configure cron jobs, otherwise it’s neccessary to &lt;a href=&quot;https://crontab.guru/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;create one&lt;/a&gt; from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the above script will be automatically executed at the set interval (e.g. every day at midnight) and copy the complete content directory and all of its subdirectories to the development server. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deleting the Kirby Page Cache After Deploying with DeployHQ</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I deploy this site (which runs on &lt;a href=&quot;https://getkirby.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, in case you didn&apos;t know) via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deployhq.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;DeployHQ&lt;/a&gt; and it has proven super helpful. I&apos;m really happy with the setup, since I didn&apos;t want to move hosting, due to more than just one reason. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sure all the changes after each deploy appear on the site immediately, I run this short SSH command after each an every update to the site, which deletes the complete “pages” cache, leaving other caches, e.g. from plugins, intact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm -rf /path_to_kirby_installation/site/cache/domainname.tld/pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way I can be sure that all updates are visible on the site right away and no outdated pages are served. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        A group of bored developers and designers has decided to start a thread on reddit to figure out who can come up with the worst volume control interface in the world:  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This find can already be considered old, but it‘s quite entertaining and fun to see. While most of the ideas are completely useless, unusable or at least very difficult to use, I’m a big fan of the exploratory part of this thread. Breaking rules, finding and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and exploring ideas, even if just for fun. I wish there was more of this all over the web, yet it’s refreshing to see it every once in while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the worst volume controls on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/search?q=volume&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; or find a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/the-worst-volume-control-ui-in-the-world-60713dc86950&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;compilation&lt;/a&gt; on UX Collective.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is a nice and comprehensive article from Erik looking at color contrast ratios and explains how they work. Even if you don‘t care about the double contrast ticks in DevTools, it‘s worth a read. Guaranteed you‘ll learn a thing or two. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The color contrast ratios mentioned in WCAG can give you an insight in how usable your color palette is. How that works isn&apos;t very transparent. Learn more about how the color contrast ratio is determined, and what that means for you (and your palette).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Removing Empty Array Keys in PHP</title>
      <link>https://foobartel.com/notes/removing-empty-array-keys-php</link>
      <guid>https://foobartel.com/notes/removing-empty-array-keys-php</guid>

      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;TIL how to remove empty array keys that don&apos;t hold any value, e.g. when passing multiple query parameters in an array via GET, the &lt;code&gt;array_filter&lt;/code&gt; function will help to clean your array.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;array_filter — Filters elements of an array using a callback function […]&lt;br /&gt;
        Iterates over each value in the array passing them to the callback function. […]&lt;br /&gt;
        If no callback is supplied, all empty entries of array will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In its simplest form, suitable for the use case from above, the &lt;code&gt;array_filter&lt;/code&gt; function looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;$params = [];
        $params = $_GET( $params );
        $params = array_filter( $params );&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This code will return the array with only the keys that do hold a value. There’s always something new to learn… &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-filter.php&quot;&gt;array_filter in the PHP.net manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://getkirby.com/releases/3.6&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;Kirby 3.6 alpha&lt;/a&gt; for a few versions now and my favorite new feature is the support for AVIF and WEBP image generation. I’m a sucker for better web performance and finally finished my small improvement to the image block. This version of the image block outputs a picture element with an AVIF, WEBP and the original format image. The width and quality parameters are currently hard-coded at 1200px and 60%/55%, respectively, which works well for me so far.
