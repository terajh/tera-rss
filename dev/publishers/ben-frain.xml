It’s not difficult conceptually, I just couldn’t find all the correct pieces in one place… When you work with lit.dev there may be times when you need animate elements.

      <content:encoded>This is a review of the Voyager from ZSA. It is a mechanical keyboard that costs over $350. It only has 52 keys, you can’t use MX switches in it, it doesn’t use Choc switch spacing, and it’s not even wireless. But I absolutely love it.
