        A few days ago, I watched this awesome video from things your mom should have told you about resisting fascism regimes.
        The main thesis is that under capitalism, where work is required to eat, have a home, have healthcare, and other essentials, participating in strikes and walkouts isn&amp;rsquo;t really an option for a lot of folks.
        Keena shares some great, actions things you can do despite that. The tl;dr version:

        If you were working a corporate job in the mid-to-late-2000&amp;rsquo;s, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably experienced &amp;ldquo;offshoring.&amp;rdquo;
        The leadership team brings in a bunch of new remote employees in a country with much cheaper labor costs and less stringent labor laws that yours. They ask you to help train them and teach them everything you know so they can &amp;ldquo;get up to speed quickly.&amp;rdquo;
        And then six months later, they lay off your whole team and keep the offshore workers.

        A few weeks ago, I was on a trip in my camper and had stopped at a gas station in Georgia to refuel.
        I saw someone sitting on the curb making a sign asking for money, so I walked over and gave him $40, figuring I would be gone by the time he was finished with his sign.
        He looked me in the eyes and started sobbing.
        I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ll ever forget that mixture of pain and relief on his face.

        Last week, Discord announced they were going to be shifting to an invasive age-verification system for all users.
        You either submit to a facial scan to verify you age, or get defaulted to a teen-user experience unless their AI infers that you must be an adult based on other unspecified data.
        It&amp;rsquo;s creepy and invasive.
        Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why it&amp;rsquo;s problem, alternatives to Discord, and what this means for my own community.

        It&amp;rsquo;s still hard to give a shit about tech right now, and I want to give you an update on my community fridge project soon, but today, I actually am excited about a tech thing!
        Today, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about container queries!
        The Use Case Responsive web design gave us media queries, which let you adjust the layout at certain breakpoints.
        For example, you may have layout that starts off as a single column on small mobile devices in portrait orientation, flips to a two-column grid on mid-sized viewports, and then becomes three or four columns in bigger viewports.

        You don&amp;rsquo;t need permission to help people.
        You don&amp;rsquo;t need much to have a positive impact on your community. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the perfect solution or for &amp;ldquo;the people in charge&amp;rdquo; to do something about a problem.
        All you need to do is something that makes things a little better than they are right now.
        Let&amp;rsquo;s unpack this a bit.
        A storm is coming&amp;hellip; This weekend New England got hit with blizzard.

        I&amp;rsquo;m finding it pretty much impossible to give a shit about anything web dev or tech related right now.
        Today, I want to rant for a minute, and then offer some pragmatic advice.
        Everything sucks The world has been pretty bad for a while.
        The juggernaut of environmental collapse. The flood of refugees into Europe (and their horrific treatment by the countries that colonized and destabilized their home countries). The assault on Ukraine.
