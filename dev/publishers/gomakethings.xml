        It&amp;rsquo;s still hard to give a shit about tech right now, and I want to give you an update on my community fridge project soon, but today, I actually am excited about a tech thing!
        Today, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about container queries!
        The Use Case Responsive web design gave us media queries, which let you adjust the layout at certain breakpoints.
        For example, you may have layout that starts off as a single column on small mobile devices in portrait orientation, flips to a two-column grid on mid-sized viewports, and then becomes three or four columns in bigger viewports.

        You don&amp;rsquo;t need permission to help people.
        You don&amp;rsquo;t need much to have a positive impact on your community. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the perfect solution or for &amp;ldquo;the people in charge&amp;rdquo; to do something about a problem.
        All you need to do is something that makes things a little better than they are right now.
        Let&amp;rsquo;s unpack this a bit.
        A storm is coming&amp;hellip; This weekend New England got hit with blizzard.

        I&amp;rsquo;m finding it pretty much impossible to give a shit about anything web dev or tech related right now.
        Today, I want to rant for a minute, and then offer some pragmatic advice.
        Everything sucks The world has been pretty bad for a while.
        The juggernaut of environmental collapse. The flood of refugees into Europe (and their horrific treatment by the countries that colonized and destabilized their home countries). The assault on Ukraine.

        Claudette Colvin died last week.
        She was Rosa Parks before Rosa Parks. And if you&amp;rsquo;re an American, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you never learned who she was.
        On March 2, 1955, she refused to give up her seat on the bus to a white woman. She was 15 years old and rebellious AF. Civil rights leaders at the time consider her too much of a liability.
        Nine months later, Rosa Parks, a quite, respectable older woman, did the same thing.

        Last week, Adam Wathan of Tailwind announced that he fired 75% of his team.
        Actually, that&amp;rsquo;s not true. He announced that&amp;hellip;
        75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday
        He&amp;rsquo;s the head of the company, but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know that from this comment. Gotta love that passive voice!
        Why did he fire three quarters of his company? AI.
        &amp;hellip;because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business&amp;hellip;

        One of the recurring themes in the Dungeon Crawler Carl book series is that your enemies aren&amp;rsquo;t people, they&amp;rsquo;re systems of power.
        In the books, nearly everyone is a victim, including the monsters and NPCs they fight. The real baddies are the super wealthy, who create systems of power to pit the poor against each other.
        It reminds me a lot of life, and that&amp;rsquo;s on purpose.
        The wrong enemy There&amp;rsquo;s this scene in the Pixar movie A Bug&amp;rsquo;s Life where Hopper, the main villain, says&amp;hellip;

        On Friday, I had just picked up my car after having some repairs done when I saw a man holding a sign that said he was homeless and needed help.
        His name is Michael. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to him before.
        I never carry cash anymore I basically never have any cash on me anymore, but I still wanted to help. I pulled over, reintroduced myself, and asked&amp;hellip;
        I don&amp;rsquo;t have any cash on me right now, but I&amp;rsquo;ll happily go buy you anything you want.
