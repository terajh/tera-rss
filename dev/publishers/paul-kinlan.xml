      <content:encoded>I&amp;#39;ve created the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;generate-html&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; Web Component, an LLM-powered tool that generates and renders interactive HTML or SVG images securely using Google Gemini or Chrome&amp;#39;s built-in AI. It features a &amp;amp;quot;Double Iframe&amp;amp;quot; architecture for security, supports multiple providers, and has zero framework dependencies. It also allows for template context to guide LLM output.</content:encoded>

        I&amp;#39;ve been exploring how to integrate advanced AI agents into my daily workflow, and email remains the most universal interface for asynchronous tasks.
        I built a &amp;amp;quot;Deep Research&amp;amp;quot; agent using Val Town that allows me to trigger complex research tasks simply by sending an email. It uses Google&amp;#39;s Deep Research model to perform the heavy lifting.
        It is pretty simple to get started, you just need to send an email.

        What if every website you visited didn&amp;#39;t actually exist until the moment you asked for it? What if the entire web was a unique, AI-generated experience, created just for you, on the fly?
        That&amp;#39;s the core idea behind my latest project, Fauxmium.
        Fauxmium is a proof-of-concept that explores what it&amp;#39;s like to browse an effectively infinite web. Everything you see inside the Fauxmium browser is generated in real-time by AI. It is not real.

My goals of the blog is to cover a range of topics that I think are going to affect the web and web development in the coming years.
        Why? I think that the nature of the web has changed and it will change even more in the coming years.

        I think this post would be good for every developer to read. It&amp;#39;s more about communication than just blogging.
        The biggest mistake software bloggers make is meandering.
        Often, the author has some valuable insight to share, but they squander their first seven paragraphs on the history of functional programming and a trip they took to Bell Labs in 1973.

        I have a bit of love-hate relationship with TypeScript, but there are parts of the typescript Type system that I really like. This article from Piccalilli is a great introduction to TypeScript&amp;#39;s utility types (which is one of the areas I like, even though it is a bit complex)
        Utility types are types that modify other types. You can think of them as functions, but they operate on types instead of values.

        I’ve been banging on for a while now about how much I’d like a declarative option for the Web Share API. I was thinking that the type attribute on the button element would be a good candidate for this (there’s prior art in the way we extended the type attribute on the input element for HTML5).
        I&amp;#39;m fully aligned with Jeremey on this one, there&amp;#39;s a heap of commands and actions that a user invokes in the browser that should be more accessible from the client and be able to be invoked without JavaScript.

        Different mediums convey information in unique ways and creators interpret the same story through unique perspectives.

        We feel that validation and enforcing baseline features are the minimum that a linter needs to support in 2025, and so we spent a lot of time making the no-invalid-at-rules, no-invalid-properties, and require-baseline rules as comprehensive as possible.
        Love it!! Absolutely love it.
        One of the areas that we would love to see more of (and we hope to work) is more integration of Baseline in to developer workflows.

        One of Shopify’s key metrics is Checkout Conversion Rate (CCR), which measures the rate of successful checkouts completed over a period of time. Through testing, Shopify found that removing unnecessary steps led to more customers completing their checkouts. Guest checkouts using autofill had a 45% higher CCR than guest checkouts without autofill. Basically, the customers who didn’t have to spend time filling out forms were more likely to actually buy something at the end of their online shopping trip.

        It&amp;#39;s exciting to see the web platform continue to evolve and improve. Interop along with Baseline are aimed to solve some of the top challenges that developers have when building for the web.
        Ultimately we only make progress as a platform when the major user-agents make shared and consistent progress on the platform and this has been a huge effort from the teams at Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Apple, not to mention Igalia and Bocoup as well as all the developers that have helped to prioritize what is important to them.

        This is such an amazing site and has become a bit of a daily habit for me. It&amp;#39;s a brilliantly simple idea that means I&amp;#39;m browsing more of Wikipedia than I ever have before.
        I built a similar demo a while ago using the now-defunct Portals API because I want to explore what a Web Browser could be if it had a UI like TikTok. My hypothesis was that while links are amazing, what is behind them is hidden, and worse (imo) it&amp;#39;s behind a banner image that is often not representative of the content.

        For the longest time I&amp;#39;d been using Replit, it had a nice flow to it. I could ask it to help me solve a problem and it would just apply the code to the project.

        This great post by Dion &amp;amp;quot;English will become the most popular development language in 6 years&amp;amp;quot; is worth a mull imho.
        There&amp;#39;s obviously a lot of push back on LLM&amp;#39;s be it what they were trained on and how much energy they use. However the technology is here, and Dion poses a great question: Will natural language become the way people control their computers?
        Two things resonated with me:
        The reason that we see so many applications pop up with a chat side bar is a signal that we are building bridges between the computers and the humans in natural language ways.

        I always include the names of the people who created the content I am linking to, if I can figure that out.

        I get a lot of newsletters, and I love them. They often contain a wealth of deep insight that I can&amp;#39;t easily find while browsing the web. Yes, there are RSS feeds that publish their protected content, but since I spend so much time in my email, I effectively use it as a way of browsing.
        I really wanted a way to get quick summaries of the newsletters I read, so I built one.

        I love RSS feeds (and ATOM too (and JSONFeed)) but one thing that frustrates me is when a feed doesn&amp;#39;t include all of the content.
        https://full-rss.deno.dev was created to partially solve this. If there is a feed that you really wish was full-content and isn&amp;#39;t then you can replace that feed with https://full-rss.deno.dev/?url=https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/feed.xml and it will get the 10 most recent posts, scrape the linked page and replace the content with a stripped down version of the full HTML page.

      <content:encoded>Generating web apps with AI agents like Replit is incredibly powerful, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment.  My experience building tldr.express, a personalized RSS feed summarizer, highlighted the importance of a detailed specification. While initial prompts yielded impressive results, I iteratively refined the app through configuration and additional prompts to address issues like email integration, AI model selection, output formatting, spam prevention, and bot mitigation.  This iterative process reinforced that while AI agents excel at rapid generation, a well-defined specification upfront is crucial for a successful outcome.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Building apps with LLMs and agents like Replit has been incredibly productive. The generated code is often vanilla and repetitive, raising questions about the future of frameworks. While frameworks offer abstractions and accelerate development, LLMs seem to disregard these patterns, focusing on implementation. This shift in software development driven by agents may lead to a world where direct code manipulation is unnecessary.  It remains to be seen if frameworks and existing architectural patterns will still be relevant in this LLM-driven future or if new patterns will emerge.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Wow! Just realized I&amp;#39;ve been blogging for over 20 years, starting way back in August 2004 on kinlan.co.uk with Blogger.  The journey has taken me through Posterous and landed me here on paul.kinlan.me with Hugo (and maybe Jekyll at some point).  Sure, there&amp;#39;s some cringe-worthy stuff in the archives, but it&amp;#39;s &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;my&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; history.  And honestly, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be where I am today without this little corner of the internet.  Huge thanks to Tim Berners-Lee and everyone who&amp;#39;s made the web what it is!</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Reflecting on my journey with computers, from the C64 and Amiga 500 to the present day, I&amp;#39;ve found a renewed excitement in software development.  New tools like repl.it and websim.ai empower rapid creation of full-stack, disposable web apps – software built for personal use and easily discarded. This ease of creation removes the barrier to starting projects, making the web an ideal platform for even single-user applications. It&amp;#39;s a shift from handcrafted software to a more ephemeral approach, allowing for quicker prototyping and experimentation.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 13:42:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>I&amp;#39;m exploring a new way to build reactive applications using an &amp;#39;Agents&amp;#39; API.  Inspired by Preact Signals and my previous reactive-prompt project, this toolkit uses Chrome&amp;#39;s prompt API.  Each Agent has a persona, task, and context, reacting to input changes.  You can chain Agents, passing data between them.  I&amp;#39;ve created different Agent types like a &amp;#39;Human&amp;#39; Agent representing user input and a &amp;#39;ToolCaller&amp;#39; that can execute JavaScript functions based on context.  This experiment explores data-flow-driven LLM applications, similar to Breadboard, and leverages Preact Signals for managing this flow.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 13:52:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>I&amp;#39;ve created a small library called &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;reactive-prompt&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; that lets you easily manage prompts in a reactive way, similar to how you&amp;#39;d build a web app with React. It uses Preact&amp;#39;s Signals to track changes to inputs and automatically re-runs prompts when those inputs update.  This allows for efficient chaining of prompts, where the output of one becomes the input of another, and only necessary prompts are re-evaluated. The library currently uses Chrome&amp;#39;s experimental prompt API but could be adapted for other providers like OpenAI or Gemini.  It makes complex prompt flows much more manageable.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I explored using ChatGPT&amp;#39;s Code Interpreter to analyze browser compatibility data from the BCD project.  My goal was to determine the latest released versions of different browsers.  While the initial results weren&amp;#39;t perfect, through a few iterations of feedback, the Code Interpreter generated a Python script that accurately extracted the desired information.  I was impressed by the speed and efficiency of this process, as it accomplished in minutes what would have taken me much longer manually.  The generated code also provided a starting point for further analysis, like visualizing browser release timelines.  Despite minor imperfections, the Code Interpreter proved to be a powerful tool for quickly extracting and analyzing data.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 19:15:01 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>I created a simple vector database called &amp;amp;quot;Vector IDB&amp;amp;quot; that runs directly in the browser using IndexedDB.  It&amp;#39;s designed to store and query JSON documents with vector embeddings, similar to Pinecone, but implemented locally.  The API is basic with &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;insert&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;update&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;delete&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;query&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; functions.  While it lacks optimizations like pre-filtering and advanced indexing found in dedicated vector databases, it provides a starting point for experimenting with vector search in the browser without relying on external services.  The project was a fun way to learn about vector databases and their use with embeddings from APIs like OpenAI.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I explored using LLMs for checking web API browser compatibility.  Existing LLMs struggle with outdated data, so I experimented with MDN&amp;#39;s Browser Compat Data (BCD).  Initial trials using raw BCD JSON with GPT-4 had limitations. To improve this, I converted the BCD into English descriptions of API support and loaded it into a Polymath instance.  This allows natural language queries about API compatibility across browsers, like &amp;amp;quot;Is CSS Grid supported in Safari, Firefox, and Chrome?&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;When was CSS acos available in Chrome?&amp;amp;quot;.  The results are promising, but further refinement is needed to ensure accuracy and reliability.</content:encoded>
