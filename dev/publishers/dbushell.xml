      <content:encoded>When I rebuilt my website I took great care to optimise fonts for both performance and aesthetics. Fonts account for around 50% of my website (bytes downloaded on an empty cache). I designed and set a performance budget around my font usage. […]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>The off-canvas menu — aka the Hamburger, if you must — has been hot ever since Jobs’ invented mobile web and Ethan Marcott put a name to responsive design. My journey Making an off-canvas menu free from heinous JavaScript has always been possible, but not ideal. […]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I’ve only gone and done it again! I redesigned my website. This is the eleventh major version. I dare say it’s my best attempt yet. There are similarities to what came before and plenty of fresh CSS paint to modernise the style. You can visit my time machine to see the ten previous designs that have […]</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Mozilla published a new State of Mozilla. It’s absolute slopaganda. A mess of trippy visuals and corpo-speak that’s been through the slop wringer too many times. I read it so you don’t have to. ⚠️ Warning: the State of Mozilla website has flashing graphics and janky animations. […]</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>I’ve made minor updates to my AI policy but you probably don’t care because you’re tired of reading criticism. You’ve dismissed all that because AI is inevitable. If you do care, and you should, you are not taking crazy pills! Billions pumped into the relentless marketing machine make for a very […]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Everyone has an opinion on markdown but why stop there? Write your own parser, make those opinions reality! That’s what I did with Hmmarkdown — my HTML-aware markdown library. It has built my website content for the past year. Turns out parsing markdown (with HTML) isn’t easy. […]</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>On Jan 14th Proton sent out an email newsletter with the subject line: “Introducing Projects - Try Lumo’s powerful new feature now” Lumo is Proton’s “AI” offering. There is a problem with this email. And I’m not talking about the question of how exactly AI aligns with Proton’s core values of privacy […]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Last week my router almost died! Disaster was averted but it dawned on me how fragile my home network was. I have all manner of VLANs and firewall rules so I can’t just plug in my ISP-provided router. With no redundancy in place a real disaster would mean panic buying an expensive replacement, […]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>My spring 2025 update ended with a to-do list, apparently. I totally forgot but I happened to complete the tasks anyway. Then disaster struck! Quick recap before the disaster. To-dones GitHub’s death spiral led me to finally self-host Forgejo publicly at git.dbushell.com. […]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I didn’t intend for my RSS-only posts to be video game reviews but that’s what you’re getting again today! I had big plans for my holiday break but I spent it gaming. If you subscribed for web dev stuff don’t worry these off-topic posts are rare :) Warning: there will be spoilers. […]</content:encoded>

      <title>Death to Scroll Fade!</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Scroll fade is that oh so wonderful web design experience where elements fade in as they scroll into view. Often with a bit of transform on the Y-axis. If you’re reading this via RSS you’ve been spared. Done subtly and in moderation scroll fade can look fine†. […]</content:encoded>
