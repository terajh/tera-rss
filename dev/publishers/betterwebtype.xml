AI can generate beautiful art, it can code and ship production-ready code, write articles, come up with design ideas and generate mockups, UI and prototypes, and it can even be a personal assistant.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I only switched from the default font when I switched from Sublime Text to Visual Studio a few years ago. That’s when I wrote the original blog post about 5 monospaced fonts with coding ligatures. I was customising Visual Studio’s theme and wanted something different. I wanted to make the setup more “mine.”</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>How do you go about picking fonts for a project? Do you just “wing it?” Pick something that looks good and is somewhat aligned with the requirements of the project? Or do you always use the same fonts again and again, regardless of requirements? Maybe you have a personal preference for some of these fonts?</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>But I don’t want to get into that in this blog post. Yes, it takes a lot of time and effort to craft beautiful and original typography but what if you don’t have the time?

      <content:encoded>how are things? My newsletter is a bit late this month. We recently got a puppy and a kitten and they’ve been keeping me busy.
