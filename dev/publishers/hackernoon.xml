      <content:encoded>AI hallucinations aren’t random glitches — they’re a natural consequence of how large language models are trained to predict plausible text, not verified truth. This guide breaks down the mechanics behind hallucinations, explains why better reasoning doesn’t guarantee factual accuracy, and offers practical strategies — from prompt constraints to RAG pipelines and verification loops — to manage risk in real-world systems.</content:encoded>

      <title>This New Decomposition Framework Makes Multi-Agent Pathfinding More Scalable</title>

      <guid>https://hackernoon.com/this-new-decomposition-framework-makes-multi-agent-pathfinding-more-scalable?source=rss</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 07:15:21 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) becomes exponentially harder as the number of agents increases, often making large instances computationally infeasible. This paper introduces a solvability-preserving decomposition framework that splits large MAPF problems into smaller, independent subproblems, enabling existing MAPF algorithms to run more efficiently without sacrificing completeness. Tested across seven state-of-the-art methods, the approach significantly reduces time and memory usage while maintaining solution quality.</content:encoded>

      <title>Time Isn’t Fundamental—It’s a Predictability Trick</title>

      <guid>https://hackernoon.com/time-has-a-direction-because-the-future-filters-it?source=rss</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 04:05:36 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Time’s arrow may be a selection effect. If not every ending is allowed, not every past is possible. Define time as the ordering that maximizes joint predictability among coupled observables, then add a minimal admissibility set, a weak constraint on allowed outcomes. That constraint breaks symmetry without teleology and yields a directional gradient in the present.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Manual image editing for product retail often bottlenecks creative teams with repetitive tasks like background removal and resizing. This article introduces Combo Banana, a prototype that automates these workflows by allowing designers to define reusable &quot;combos&quot;—sequences of AI-driven operations executed in seconds. Built on a modern stack featuring Gradio for the interface, Nano Banana for advanced AI processing, and Google Cloud Run for serverless scalability, the tool demonstrates how powerful models can be abstracted into practical, user-friendly solutions. By bridging the gap between raw AI capabilities and daily design needs, Combo Banana transforms 15-minute manual tasks into 30-second automated processes.</content:encoded>

        Not all hypermedia frameworks are created equal:
        
        HTMX is a dedicated specialist focusing exclusively on the Hypermedia-Driven Application (HDA) model. It &quot;completes HTML&quot; by allowing any element to trigger AJAX requests and receive HTML partials.
        
        Lightview is a multi-paradigm framework that treats hypermedia as just one option. It allows you to mix hypermedia patterns with functional programming and JSON-driven interfaces (cDOM), making it uniquely suited for complex business logic and secure, AI-generated user interfaces.
        
        The Verdict: Choose HTMX for pure, battle-tested hypermedia simplicity; choose Lightview if you need architectural flexibility, client-side reactivity, or the ability to source content locally via CSS selectors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/building-with-hypermedia-htmxs-purity-and-lightviews-flexibility?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>APIs are useful, but they&apos;re not always available, complete, or worth the overhead. If the data you need is already public and you&apos;re manually checking a website, scraping is simply a way to automate that behavior. Small, low-frequency scrapers can turn repetitive browsing into structured data, save time, and reduce cognitive load making scraping a practical productivity tool rather than a heavy engineering decision.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/you-dont-need-an-api-for-everything-sometimes-scraping-is-enough?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Java Under the Hood - Dive Into JVM Memory Model and Garbage Collector</title>
      <link>https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss</link>
      <guid>https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:58:21 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        Java abstracts away manual memory management, but the JVM still operates on a precise memory model. Local variables and method frames live on the stack, while actual objects live on the heap, which is divided into generations to make garbage collection efficient. Different reference types (strong, soft, weak, phantom) influence GC behavior, especially for caches and off-heap resources.
        
        Garbage Collection uses variations of mark-and-sweep to identify reachable objects and reclaim memory from the rest, sometimes compacting to avoid fragmentation. GC pauses are real and can impact latency, which is why selecting the right collector matters (G1, Parallel, ZGC, Shenandoah, etc.) and why JVM tuning exists.
        
        Understanding how memory works under the hood enables developers to diagnose leaks, reduce allocation pressure, tune pause times, and configure the JVM for different workloads — turning memory management from a black box into a performance tool.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>Crypto contract verification is the definitive proof of identity in the DeFi ecosystem. However, the process is often misunderstood, leading to frustration when the &quot;Deterministic Black Box&quot; of the compiler produces mismatching fingerprints. This article demystifies verification by visualizing it as a &quot;Mirror Mechanism,&quot; where local compilation environments must precisely replicate the deployment conditions. We move beyond manual web uploads to establish a robust, automated workflow using CLI tools. We analyze the critical trade-off between aggressive viaIR gas optimizations and verification complexity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/the-deterministic-black-box-that-keeps-failing-your-etherscan-verifications?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Building a Better Debugging Experience: A Deep Dive into Capturing and Replaying gRPC Traffic</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 06:12:42 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Debugging microservices is hard because it&apos;s difficult to see the data flowing between them. We built a &quot;Request Capture Engine&quot; that acts like a flight recorder for our gRPC traffic. It uses gRPC interceptors to automatically record request/response payloads, which are stored in object storage and correlated with OpenTelemetry trace IDs. This allows us to perfectly replay production traffic for debugging, find specific payloads with a simple command-line tool (`rcap`), and even power interactive UIs for A/B testing and analysis. This post explains how you can build a similar system.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/building-a-better-debugging-experience-a-deep-dive-into-capturing-and-replaying-grpc-traffic?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>The Tab Leader Pattern eliminates redundant API polling across multiple browser tabs. Only one tab handles data fetching while all others benefit from shared cache updates through localStorage and the BroadcastChannel API. This pattern reduces API calls by 80-90% while improving data consistency.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/stop-wasting-api-calls-and-implement-the-tab-leader-pattern-instead?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
