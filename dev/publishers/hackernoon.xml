      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:01:19 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>A Series B startup hired me to build its data platform from scratch. With 50M events/day and a one-person team, I chose boring, scalable tools: Fivetran, Airbyte, BigQuery, dbt, Dagster Cloud, and Looker. No Kafka. No Spark. Total cost under $3K/month. The focus: operability, trust, semantic consistency, and a clear upgrade path—not overengineering for imaginary scale.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 09:52:27 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>AI is driving a structural GPU shortage as Big Tech pours $600B into infrastructure. Data center GPU markets are projected to grow 10x by 2032. Unlike crypto mining, GPU yield comes from commercial AI compute demand. Platforms like GPUnex let investors access this via structured packages with daily returns. Higher upside than staking, but with hardware depreciation and utilization risks to watch.</content:encoded>

      <title>Why Faster Cross-Border Payments Still Don’t Work for Businesses</title>
      <link>https://hackernoon.com/why-faster-cross-border-payments-still-dont-work-for-businesses?source=rss</link>

      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 09:38:59 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Payment rails have modernized—faster settlement, richer standards, regulatory KPIs. But inside enterprises, data remains fragmented across banks, ERPs, and spreadsheets. Mid-market firms suffer most, lacking the scale to internalize complexity. The real bottleneck isn’t execution speed; it’s post-trade data usability. Closing the last-mile enterprise data gap is key to turning infrastructure reform into real business transparency.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 09:31:48 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>AI is disrupting software and knowledge work faster than past tech revolutions due to its velocity and instant distribution. Job displacement is real, and denial is dangerous. But Computer Science isn’t obsolete—it’s evolving. The edge now lies in architecting AI systems, grounding LLMs, managing context, and evaluating outputs. Don’t fight AI. Master it, move from artisan coder to system architect, and keep building to stay sharp.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 09:23:35 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Amid the AI gold rush, Jupyter notebooks have become a major security blind spot. A scan of 5,000 public .ipynb files uncovered AWS access keys, OpenAI and Hugging Face tokens, prompt injection payloads, and unsafe pickle deserialization risks. Traditional scanners miss notebook outputs, leaving credentials exposed. The real issue isn’t revoking leaked keys—it’s fixing broken developer hygiene before secrets reach production.</content:encoded>

      <title>The Advertising Model is Coming for AI Agents (And It&apos;s Worse Than You Think)</title>
      <link>https://hackernoon.com/the-advertising-model-is-coming-for-ai-agents-and-its-worse-than-you-think?source=rss</link>

      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 09:17:43 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>AI agents face unsustainable economics, making advertising inevitable. But unlike traditional ads, AI placements may be invisible—embedded in recommendations shaped by biased training data, RAG retrieval, or affiliate-weighted tools. As platforms like Perplexity and Google experiment with sponsored AI results, the real risk is trust erosion. Hyper-personalized, undisclosed persuasion could redefine digital advertising—and user autonomy.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>RAG systems fail because of broken data pipelines, not bad models. Poor chunking orphans meaning. Stale indexes serve outdated answers. Missing metadata can&apos;t filter irrelevant results. Fix Monday: audit your corpus completeness, rebuild indexes regularly, and measure retrieval recall before blaming the LLM. RAG is search with a generative frontend—treat it like one.</content:encoded>

A basic AI agent setup involves: picking an LLM provider, getting an API key, creating a streaming endpoint, and wiring it to a UI.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/building-ai-agents-doesnt-have-to-be-rocket-science-spoiler-its-mostly-api-calls?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        Not all hypermedia frameworks are created equal:
        
        HTMX is a dedicated specialist focusing exclusively on the Hypermedia-Driven Application (HDA) model. It &quot;completes HTML&quot; by allowing any element to trigger AJAX requests and receive HTML partials.
        
        Lightview is a multi-paradigm framework that treats hypermedia as just one option. It allows you to mix hypermedia patterns with functional programming and JSON-driven interfaces (cDOM), making it uniquely suited for complex business logic and secure, AI-generated user interfaces.
        
        The Verdict: Choose HTMX for pure, battle-tested hypermedia simplicity; choose Lightview if you need architectural flexibility, client-side reactivity, or the ability to source content locally via CSS selectors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/building-with-hypermedia-htmxs-purity-and-lightviews-flexibility?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>APIs are useful, but they&apos;re not always available, complete, or worth the overhead. If the data you need is already public and you&apos;re manually checking a website, scraping is simply a way to automate that behavior. Small, low-frequency scrapers can turn repetitive browsing into structured data, save time, and reduce cognitive load making scraping a practical productivity tool rather than a heavy engineering decision.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/you-dont-need-an-api-for-everything-sometimes-scraping-is-enough?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Java Under the Hood - Dive Into JVM Memory Model and Garbage Collector</title>
      <link>https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss</link>
      <guid>https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:58:21 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        Java abstracts away manual memory management, but the JVM still operates on a precise memory model. Local variables and method frames live on the stack, while actual objects live on the heap, which is divided into generations to make garbage collection efficient. Different reference types (strong, soft, weak, phantom) influence GC behavior, especially for caches and off-heap resources.
        
        Garbage Collection uses variations of mark-and-sweep to identify reachable objects and reclaim memory from the rest, sometimes compacting to avoid fragmentation. GC pauses are real and can impact latency, which is why selecting the right collector matters (G1, Parallel, ZGC, Shenandoah, etc.) and why JVM tuning exists.
        
        Understanding how memory works under the hood enables developers to diagnose leaks, reduce allocation pressure, tune pause times, and configure the JVM for different workloads — turning memory management from a black box into a performance tool.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>Crypto contract verification is the definitive proof of identity in the DeFi ecosystem. However, the process is often misunderstood, leading to frustration when the &quot;Deterministic Black Box&quot; of the compiler produces mismatching fingerprints. This article demystifies verification by visualizing it as a &quot;Mirror Mechanism,&quot; where local compilation environments must precisely replicate the deployment conditions. We move beyond manual web uploads to establish a robust, automated workflow using CLI tools. We analyze the critical trade-off between aggressive viaIR gas optimizations and verification complexity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/the-deterministic-black-box-that-keeps-failing-your-etherscan-verifications?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Building a Better Debugging Experience: A Deep Dive into Capturing and Replaying gRPC Traffic</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 06:12:42 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Debugging microservices is hard because it&apos;s difficult to see the data flowing between them. We built a &quot;Request Capture Engine&quot; that acts like a flight recorder for our gRPC traffic. It uses gRPC interceptors to automatically record request/response payloads, which are stored in object storage and correlated with OpenTelemetry trace IDs. This allows us to perfectly replay production traffic for debugging, find specific payloads with a simple command-line tool (`rcap`), and even power interactive UIs for A/B testing and analysis. This post explains how you can build a similar system.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/building-a-better-debugging-experience-a-deep-dive-into-capturing-and-replaying-grpc-traffic?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
