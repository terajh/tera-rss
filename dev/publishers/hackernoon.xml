      <content:encoded>AI has shifted insider risk from malicious intent to workflow convenience. Employees use generative AI tools that move data across CRMs, Slack, APIs, and third-party apps in seconds—often without visibility. Traditional DLP and IAM controls can’t track these multi-hop flows. According to Proofpoint, insider-driven data loss is rising, pushing CISOs to build AI-specific governance fast.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 10:06:34 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, solving the volatility problem that makes Bitcoin and other cryptos unsuitable for daily transactions. There are four main types: fiat-backed (like USDT), asset-backed (like PAX Gold), algorithmic (like DAI), and calibration-based (like O coin). Each has different mechanisms, risks, and use cases. Fiat-backed coins offer simplicity but require trust in centralized reserves. Asset-backed coins provide tangible backing but face supply limitations. Algorithmic coins are decentralized but can fail under extreme conditions. Calibration-based coins offer unlimited supply and stability through real-world price observation. Understanding these differences is crucial for anyone navigating the cryptocurrency space.</content:encoded>

      <title>The Next Trillion-Dollar AI Shift: Why OpenClaw Changes Everything for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://hackernoon.com/the-next-trillion-dollar-ai-shift-why-openclaw-changes-everything-for-llms?source=rss</link>
      <guid>https://hackernoon.com/the-next-trillion-dollar-ai-shift-why-openclaw-changes-everything-for-llms?source=rss</guid>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 01:58:28 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        OpenClaw is an open-source, model-agnostic agent framework that runs entirely on your local machine — no cloud, no API keys, no recurring costs.
        
        It connects to Ollama (or LM Studio / llama.cpp) to serve open-weight LLMs like Minimax M2.5 and GLM-5 locally.
        
        Combined with hardware like the Apple Mac M3 Max (128GB unified memory) or NVIDIA DGX Spark (128GB, 1 petaFLOP FP4), it creates a Complete Local Agent Command Center.
        
        Agents can write code, analyze data, browse files, and orchestrate multi-step workflows — all offline and private.
        
        MiniMax Agent (M2.5) is a powerful cloud benchmark; OpenClaw replicates its autonomous capabilities locally with open-weight models.
        
        The setup is straightforward: install Ollama → pull models → clone OpenClaw → configure YAML → block outbound traffic → launch.
        
        Your data never leaves your machine. 
        
        Memory, skills, and context are stored as plain Markdown and YAML files.
        
        This is the shift from renting intelligence to owning it.

      <content:encoded>AI doesn’t fix BI architecture - it stress-tests it. If your dashboards rely on live warehouse queries, AI will multiply cost volatility and instability.

      <title>Building with Hypermedia: HTMX&apos;s Purity and Lightview&apos;s Flexibility.</title>

      <content:encoded>
        Not all hypermedia frameworks are created equal:
        
        HTMX is a dedicated specialist focusing exclusively on the Hypermedia-Driven Application (HDA) model. It &quot;completes HTML&quot; by allowing any element to trigger AJAX requests and receive HTML partials.
        
        Lightview is a multi-paradigm framework that treats hypermedia as just one option. It allows you to mix hypermedia patterns with functional programming and JSON-driven interfaces (cDOM), making it uniquely suited for complex business logic and secure, AI-generated user interfaces.
        
        The Verdict: Choose HTMX for pure, battle-tested hypermedia simplicity; choose Lightview if you need architectural flexibility, client-side reactivity, or the ability to source content locally via CSS selectors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/building-with-hypermedia-htmxs-purity-and-lightviews-flexibility?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>APIs are useful, but they&apos;re not always available, complete, or worth the overhead. If the data you need is already public and you&apos;re manually checking a website, scraping is simply a way to automate that behavior. Small, low-frequency scrapers can turn repetitive browsing into structured data, save time, and reduce cognitive load making scraping a practical productivity tool rather than a heavy engineering decision.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/you-dont-need-an-api-for-everything-sometimes-scraping-is-enough?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Conventional Voice AI is binary with regards to interruptions. I will employ language taxonomy to establish a state machine which dissociates the turn-taking process in back-channeling from actual floor-taking thus creating a more human-like interaction.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/stop-muting-your-users-building-a-pragmatic-interruption-state-machine-for-voice-ai?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Java Under the Hood - Dive Into JVM Memory Model and Garbage Collector</title>
      <link>https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss</link>

      <content:encoded>
        Java abstracts away manual memory management, but the JVM still operates on a precise memory model. Local variables and method frames live on the stack, while actual objects live on the heap, which is divided into generations to make garbage collection efficient. Different reference types (strong, soft, weak, phantom) influence GC behavior, especially for caches and off-heap resources.
        
        Garbage Collection uses variations of mark-and-sweep to identify reachable objects and reclaim memory from the rest, sometimes compacting to avoid fragmentation. GC pauses are real and can impact latency, which is why selecting the right collector matters (G1, Parallel, ZGC, Shenandoah, etc.) and why JVM tuning exists.
        
        Understanding how memory works under the hood enables developers to diagnose leaks, reduce allocation pressure, tune pause times, and configure the JVM for different workloads — turning memory management from a black box into a performance tool.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>Happiness is usually treated as a vague, ethereal concept that &quot;just happens&quot; If life is a system, then Happiness is the output. To fix it, I realized I needed to stop treating happiness like magic and start treating it like math.
