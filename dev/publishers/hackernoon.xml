      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 10:55:40 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Recurring payments are merchant-initiated transactions that traditionally require storing card details, increasing security and PCI risks. Tokenization replaces sensitive card data with merchant-specific tokens and cryptograms, reducing fraud exposure, shrinking compliance scope, and improving authorization performance—making subscription payments more secure and efficient.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 10:44:33 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>With minimum and living wage increases arriving in April 2026 and hiring slowing across the UK, SMEs can no longer rely on workforce expansion to drive growth. Instead, sustainable cost control will depend on reducing payroll inefficiencies, improving visibility, protecting retention, and tightening internal processes to absorb rising labour expenses without shrinking margins.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 10:00:05 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>This essay frames 2026 as a year of heightened geopolitical and macro uncertainty that forces crypto to mature: away from meme-driven speculation and toward “value” via tokenization, privacy infrastructure, stablecoin expansion, and a renewed focus on DeFi. It argues that hard assets and real-world settlement rails gain importance as AI agents proliferate and governments deepen their role in digital markets—making autonomy, clear thinking, and selective risk-taking the core survival strategy.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 00:59:59 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Traditional data platforms rely on centralized monoliths and complex engineering pipelines that often create bottlenecks for business decision-makers. This article introduces Da2a, an open-source prototype that proposes a decentralized, agentic architecture where specialized Domain Agents (e.g., Marketing, E-commerce) collaborate through a Root Orchestrator using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. By treating data sources as autonomous experts that communicate via standardized &quot;agent cards&quot; rather than static tables, Da2a demonstrates how multi-agent systems can intuitively solve complex cross-domain problems, offering a scalable and insight-focused alternative to rigid data warehousing.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Browsers still can’t provide the same smooth calling experience as native mobile apps. Many popular services simply block calls from mobile browsers and force users to install a native app instead. Here are some practical solutions that actually work.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-web-calls-feel-native-on-mobile?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Building with Hypermedia: HTMX&apos;s Purity and Lightview&apos;s Flexibility.</title>

      <content:encoded>
        Not all hypermedia frameworks are created equal:
        
        HTMX is a dedicated specialist focusing exclusively on the Hypermedia-Driven Application (HDA) model. It &quot;completes HTML&quot; by allowing any element to trigger AJAX requests and receive HTML partials.
        
        Lightview is a multi-paradigm framework that treats hypermedia as just one option. It allows you to mix hypermedia patterns with functional programming and JSON-driven interfaces (cDOM), making it uniquely suited for complex business logic and secure, AI-generated user interfaces.
        
        The Verdict: Choose HTMX for pure, battle-tested hypermedia simplicity; choose Lightview if you need architectural flexibility, client-side reactivity, or the ability to source content locally via CSS selectors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/building-with-hypermedia-htmxs-purity-and-lightviews-flexibility?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>APIs are useful, but they&apos;re not always available, complete, or worth the overhead. If the data you need is already public and you&apos;re manually checking a website, scraping is simply a way to automate that behavior. Small, low-frequency scrapers can turn repetitive browsing into structured data, save time, and reduce cognitive load making scraping a practical productivity tool rather than a heavy engineering decision.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/you-dont-need-an-api-for-everything-sometimes-scraping-is-enough?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Java Under the Hood - Dive Into JVM Memory Model and Garbage Collector</title>
      <link>https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss</link>
      <guid>https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:58:21 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        Java abstracts away manual memory management, but the JVM still operates on a precise memory model. Local variables and method frames live on the stack, while actual objects live on the heap, which is divided into generations to make garbage collection efficient. Different reference types (strong, soft, weak, phantom) influence GC behavior, especially for caches and off-heap resources.
        
        Garbage Collection uses variations of mark-and-sweep to identify reachable objects and reclaim memory from the rest, sometimes compacting to avoid fragmentation. GC pauses are real and can impact latency, which is why selecting the right collector matters (G1, Parallel, ZGC, Shenandoah, etc.) and why JVM tuning exists.
        
        Understanding how memory works under the hood enables developers to diagnose leaks, reduce allocation pressure, tune pause times, and configure the JVM for different workloads — turning memory management from a black box into a performance tool.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/java-under-the-hood-dive-into-jvm-memory-model-and-garbage-collector?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>Crypto contract verification is the definitive proof of identity in the DeFi ecosystem. However, the process is often misunderstood, leading to frustration when the &quot;Deterministic Black Box&quot; of the compiler produces mismatching fingerprints. This article demystifies verification by visualizing it as a &quot;Mirror Mechanism,&quot; where local compilation environments must precisely replicate the deployment conditions. We move beyond manual web uploads to establish a robust, automated workflow using CLI tools. We analyze the critical trade-off between aggressive viaIR gas optimizations and verification complexity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/the-deterministic-black-box-that-keeps-failing-your-etherscan-verifications?source=rss&quot;&gt;Read All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
