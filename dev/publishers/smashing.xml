      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>In CSS, we can create “stacking contexts” where elements are visually placed one on top of the next in a three-dimensional sense that creates the perception of depth. Stacking contexts are incredibly useful, but they’re also widely misunderstood and often mistakenly created, leading to a slew of layout issues that can be tricky to solve.</content:encoded>
