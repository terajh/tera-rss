      <content:encoded>I&amp;#8217;ve been looking for a new contract for a little while now, and thought I&amp;#8217;d try to improve my chances by responding to some feedback which suggests, based on my CV, it&amp;#8217;s not that clear what I can do and why you&amp;#8217;d hire me. I wrote a &amp;#8220;little&amp;#8221; thing, then asked Bing&amp;#8217;s ChatGPT bot to [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>While working at Burberry I had a few opportunities to work directly with some of the lovely people at Google, focussing on site speed, resilience, and improving the user experience. Working with Google representatives, we organised a series of fascinating hackathon events relating to improving perceived performance, and not losing an offline user. Perception of [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>In case you didn&amp;#8217;t already believe it, your Web Browser has super powers. No longer is it something to merely display a document marked up with hypertext. No longer is it limited to the read-only text and images of the olden days (aka the last two decades or so). Oh no. Now that the browser [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>In my previous articles I took you through the process of setting up your own private WebPageTest, either via the AWS interface, or via Terraform infrastructure as code). By default, this would create a Private WebPageTest instance that uses the latest code on the release branch of the official WPOFoundation github repo for WebPageTest. This [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>This article assumes you have an understanding of what Terraform is, what WebPageTest is and some AWS basics. Have you ever wanted to have your WebPageTest setup managed as infrastructure as code, so you can keep all those carefully tuned changes and custom settings in source control, ready to confidently and repeatedly destroy and rebuild at [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>This article assumes that you know the basics of AWS, WebPageTest, SSH, and at least one linux text editor. When talking to people about website performance stats, I&amp;#8217;ll usually split it into Real User Metrics (RUM) and Automated (Synthetic/Test Lab): RUM is performance data reported from the website you own, reported into the analytics tool [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>The fantastic WebPageTest, free to use and public, has been available to set up your own private instances for many years; I wrote this up a while back, and scripted a Terraform version to make this as easy and automated as possible. For AWS it was just a case of creating an EC2 instance (other [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>A few days ago these workmen were using cutting machinery dangerously close to my broadband cables: Shortly after this picture was taken &amp;#8211; bang! No internet! They cut the cables while doing their work!

      <content:encoded>In my last article I walked through the steps to get an Android phone connected to a private WebPageTest server as a web page test agent. In this post I&amp;#8217;ll list out the actual hardware I used in order to get this all working! Raspberry Pi 3 B The workhorse for this project is a [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
