        &lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#39;re a die-hard fan or just someone looking for reliable access to sought-after events, understanding how Ticketmaster accounts work and what they offer can be invaluable. Let’s delve into everything you need to know about purchasing these accounts, the potential benefits they bring, and how to navigate this growing trend with confidence.
        Buy Ticketmaster Accounts
        The demand for tickets to concerts, sports events, and festivals has skyrocketed in recent years. This surge has made it increasingly challenging to secure tickets through standard means.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Buying Ticketmaster accounts provides an alternative route. With a verified account, you can access exclusive pre-sales and gain early entry into high-demand events. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Many sellers offer these accounts tailored for different needs—some focus on specific genres of music or types of events, while others provide general access. It’s essential to do your homework before purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ensure the seller is reputable by checking reviews and asking questions about their services. A genuine Ticketmaster account can be a game-changer for avid event-goers looking to enhance their ticket-buying experience without the usual stress associated with securing passes for popular shows.
        What are Ticketmaster Accounts?
        Ticketmaster accounts are digital profiles that allow users to buy, sell, and manage tickets for events. These accounts serve as a hub for everything related to ticket purchases—concerts, sports games, theater shows, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you create an account with Ticketmaster, you&amp;#39;re granted access to exclusive pre-sales and promotions. This can be especially valuable when trying to secure high-demand tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Users can easily track their orders through the account dashboard. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can view upcoming events or check your purchase history.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, having an account makes it simple to transfer tickets or share them with friends. The convenience of managing all your ticket needs in one place enhances the overall experience of attending live events.
        Benefits of Owning a Ticketmaster Account
        Owning a Ticketmaster account unlocks a world of convenience for ticket buyers. Having your own account allows you to save personal information, making the checkout process seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You gain access to exclusive presales and early ticket releases that are not available to the general public. This can be crucial when trying to secure tickets for highly sought-after events.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, managing your order history is simple with an account. You can easily track past purchases or resell tickets if plans change.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With notifications set for your favorite artists and venues, you&amp;#39;ll never miss out on upcoming shows. The personalized experience enhances your engagement with live entertainment in ways that a non-member simply cannot enjoy.
        How to Buy a Ticketmaster Account
        Buying a Ticketmaster account can be straightforward if you know where to look. Start by researching reputable sellers online. Check reviews and ratings to ensure you&amp;#39;re dealing with trustworthy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve identified potential sellers, compare prices. Be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true; they often are. A fair price typically reflects the account&amp;#39;s age and ticket history.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before making a purchase, confirm that the account has no restrictions or limitations. Ask for details on its usage history as well—this information is crucial for your peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to proceed, use secure payment methods. This adds an extra layer of protection against fraud. After purchasing, change the password immediately and update any recovery options linked to the account for added security measures.
        The Risks of Buying a Ticketmaster Account
        Buying a Ticketmaster account may seem appealing, but it carries several risks that potential buyers should consider.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First and foremost is the issue of legality. Purchasing accounts can violate Ticketmaster&amp;#39;s terms of service, leading to permanent bans or access restrictions. This means your investment could vanish without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the risk of scams. Unscrupulous sellers might offer fake or compromised accounts, leaving you with nothing and potentially exposing your personal information to fraudsters.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, there’s no guarantee that the tickets associated with these accounts are legitimate. You could end up purchasing stolen tickets that will be canceled before the event.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even if everything seems genuine at first glance, you may face difficulties in managing or transferring ownership later on. These hidden complications can turn what seemed like a smart purchase into a frustrating experience quickly.

        &lt;p&gt;Tips for Using Your Ticketmaster Account
        Once you have your Ticketmaster account, it&amp;#39;s essential to make the most of it. Start by keeping your login information secure. Use a strong password and enable two-factor authentication for added protection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with the dashboard. Understanding where everything is located can save you time when purchasing tickets or managing orders.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Set up alerts for events you&amp;#39;re interested in. This way, you&amp;#39;ll never miss out on ticket sales or special promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider linking a payment method directly to your account for quicker checkouts during high-demand releases. Speed matters when securing those coveted seats!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stay updated on venue policies and event guidelines. Knowing these details ahead of time can enhance your overall experience at shows or games.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on exclusive offers available only to account holders—these can lead to great savings!
        Alternatives to Buying a Ticketmaster Account
        If buying a Ticketmaster account isn’t your thing, there are plenty of alternatives to consider. One option is to create your own Ticketmaster account for free. This allows you to access exclusive presales and promotions without any risk.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another alternative is utilizing resale platforms like StubHub or Vivid Seats. These sites often feature tickets from other fans who can no longer attend events. You may find great deals while ensuring the legitimacy of the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joining fan clubs or mailing lists for your favorite artists can also be beneficial. Many times, these organizations offer early access to tickets before they hit mainstream sites like Ticketmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on local venues and smaller event organizers. They might have their own ticketing systems that bypass larger corporations altogether, offering unique experiences at more affordable prices.
        Introduction to Ticketmaster and its importance
        Ticketmaster is a leading platform for ticket sales, connecting millions of fans with their favorite events. Whether it&amp;#39;s concerts, sports games, or theater performances, Ticketmaster facilitates access to unforgettable experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Its importance lies in its user-friendly interface and extensive network of venues. Users can quickly find and purchase tickets with just a few clicks. This convenience has made it the go-to source for event-goers around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Ticketmaster offers various features such as mobile ticketing and personalized recommendations. These innovations enhance the overall customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a reputation built on reliability and trustworthiness, Ticketmaster serves as an essential resource in the entertainment industry. Without it, navigating live events would be far more complicated for both fans and organizers alike.
        What are Ticketmaster accounts and how do they work?
        Ticketmaster accounts are digital profiles that allow users to purchase, manage, and access tickets for concerts, sports events, and other live performances. These accounts streamline the ticket-buying process by storing user information and payment methods.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you create an account on Ticketmaster’s platform, you gain immediate access to a wide range of events. This includes presales, exclusive offers, and personalized recommendations based on your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once registered, managing your tickets becomes easy. You can view upcoming events you&amp;#39;ve purchased tickets for or transfer them to friends with just a few clicks. The platform also provides notifications about event changes or new shows in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Security is prioritized within Ticketmaster accounts. They use encryption technology to protect personal data during transactions while offering features such as two-factor authentication for added safety.
        Benefits of buying a Ticketmaster account
        Owning a Ticketmaster account opens doors to exclusive benefits. You gain early access to ticket sales, allowing you to snag the best seats before they&amp;#39;re gone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, having an account simplifies your purchasing process. With saved payment information and preferences, buying tickets becomes quick and hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a Ticketmaster account, you also enjoy personalized recommendations based on your favorite artists and events. This tailored experience enhances your event discovery journey.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover, accounts often provide loyalty rewards or points systems that can lead to discounts or perks for future purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Easy tracking of past orders gives you peace of mind regarding transactions and helps manage your entertainment schedule seamlessly.
        How to choose the right seller for your Ticketmaster account
        Choosing the right seller for your Ticketmaster account can be crucial. Start by checking reviews and testimonials from previous buyers. A reputable seller often has a history of positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Look for sellers who provide clear details about their accounts. Transparency is key in transactions like these. If they hide information or have vague descriptions, it’s best to steer clear.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Verify their customer support options as well. Reliable sellers should offer prompt assistance if issues arise after purchase. Communication channels such as email or live chat indicate professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider payment methods offered by the seller. Secure payment options protect you during the transaction process, providing peace of mind while making an important investment in your online ticketing experience.
        Steps to take after purchasing a Ticketmaster account
        After purchasing a Ticketmaster account, the first step is to verify your credentials. Log in using the provided information and change the password immediately for security purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next, review your account settings. Ensure that all personal details are accurate and up-to-date. This includes your email address, phone number, and payment methods.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with the interface. Explore different sections such as upcoming events, order history, and notifications. Understanding how everything works will enhance your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Set up alerts for events or artists you love. Ticketmaster often provides notifications when tickets go on sale or when new shows are announced.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check if there are any promotional offers available under your new account. Sometimes exclusive deals come with newly created accounts that can save money on future purchases.
        Conclusion: Is buying a Ticketmaster account worth it?
        When considering whether to buy a Ticketmaster account, it’s essential to weigh the pros and cons carefully. On one hand, having an established account can provide you with quicker access to tickets for popular events and exclusive pre-sales. This ease of use is certainly appealing, especially for those who frequently attend concerts or shows.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, potential risks are also involved in this decision. The possibility of scams or issues related to ticket authenticity should not be overlooked. Additionally, understanding the terms of service on Ticketmaster is crucial since buying accounts may violate their policies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you decide that purchasing a Ticketmaster account aligns with your needs and lifestyle, ensure you choose a reputable seller. Take time to research and read reviews before making any commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Assessing your passion for live events against the risks associated with buying an account will help inform your choice about whether it&amp;#39;s worth diving into this option.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether you&amp;#39;re just starting or looking to expand, buying a verified Shopify account could be your ticket to unlocking new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Curious about how this works? Let’s dive into everything you need to know about buying verified Shopify accounts and why they might just be the best investment you&amp;#39;ll ever make for your business!
        Buy Verified Shopify Accounts
        Buying verified Shopify accounts is becoming a strategic move for many entrepreneurs. With an established account, you gain instant credibility in the eyes of customers. This trust can lead to increased sales and brand loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A verified account often signifies that you&amp;#39;re operating under best practices recommended by Shopify. It reduces the time spent on setup, letting you focus on product development and customer engagement instead. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, a verified account may come with valuable insights from previous usage metrics, providing guidance for your marketing strategies and inventory management.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choosing to buy a verified Shopify account opens doors to new opportunities that would otherwise require significant time and effort to achieve on your own. It&amp;#39;s about leveraging existing advantages to propel your business forward more efficiently.
        What is Shopify and why it&amp;#39;s important for businesses?
        Shopify is an e-commerce platform that enables businesses to create and manage their online stores effortlessly. With its user-friendly interface, entrepreneurs can set up shop without extensive technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This platform caters to a wide range of business needs, from small startups to large enterprises. Shopify offers customizable templates, payment processing solutions, and inventory management tools.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The importance of Shopify lies in its ability to streamline the selling process. Businesses can reach global audiences while focusing on growth rather than logistics. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with various apps and services, enhancing functionality as your business evolves. Using a reliable platform like Shopify allows companies to establish credibility and build brand loyalty effectively.
        The benefits of using a verified Shopify account
        Using a verified Shopify account streamlines your e-commerce experience. It adds credibility to your store, which is essential for building trust with customers. Shoppers are more likely to purchase from an established and verified platform.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With verification, you gain access to exclusive features that can enhance your business operations. These include advanced analytics tools and priority customer support. Such resources empower you to optimize sales strategies effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A verified account also improves SEO rankings on search engines, making it easier for potential customers to find your store online. Increased visibility leads directly to higher traffic and conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, using a verified account helps protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions. This security assurance not only safeguards your earnings but also boosts customer confidence when shopping at your store.
        How to buy a verified Shopify account
        Buying a verified Shopify account involves more than just selecting an option online. Start by researching reputable sellers who specialize in verified accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check for reviews and ratings to gauge their credibility. It’s crucial to communicate with the seller to clarify any doubts you may have about the account&amp;#39;s history or features.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve chosen a seller, ensure that they provide proper documentation confirming the account&amp;#39;s verification status. This can include screenshots of verification emails or proof of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After making your purchase, change all passwords and security settings immediately. This helps protect your new investment from unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep track of any ongoing support offered by the seller post-purchase. Building a relationship can be beneficial as you navigate setting up your store on Shopify.
        Things to consider before purchasing a Shopify account
        Before diving into purchasing a Shopify account, it&amp;#39;s essential to do your homework. Research the seller&amp;#39;s reputation. Look for reviews and testimonials from previous buyers; they can provide insight into their reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next, evaluate the features included with the account. Does it come with any existing products or customer data? Understanding what you’re getting is crucial for making an informed decision.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider the price point as well. A cheaper account might be tempting but could lack key functionalities or support that more expensive options offer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check if there are any hidden fees tied to payment processing or monthly subscriptions. Transparency in costs will save you headaches down the line.
        Tips for managing a verified Shopify account effectively
        Managing a verified Shopify account requires attention and strategy. Start by keeping your store’s design clean and user-friendly. A cluttered layout can deter potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regularly update your inventory to keep items fresh and relevant. Staying on top of trends can help attract more visitors to your shop.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Engage with customers through personalized emails or social media interactions. Building relationships enhances loyalty and encourages repeat purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use analytics tools provided by Shopify to track performance metrics. Understanding customer behavior helps in making informed decisions that boost sales.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget about SEO best practices for product descriptions and blog content. This will improve visibility in search engines, driving more organic traffic to your site.

        A verified account on Shopify can significantly enhance your store’s credibility. It signals to customers that you are a legitimate business, fostering trust and encouraging purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When shoppers see the verification, they feel more secure in their transactions. This assurance often leads to higher conversion rates. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Investing in a verified Shopify account means investing in your brand&amp;#39;s reputation and longevity online.
        How to Buy a Verified Shopify Account
        Buying a verified Shopify account can be straightforward if you follow the right steps. Start by doing thorough research on reputable sellers. Look for platforms that specialize in selling verified accounts, as they often provide better security and customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check reviews and testimonials from previous buyers to gauge the seller&amp;#39;s reliability. This feedback can help you make an informed decision.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve found a trustworthy source, assess the features included with the account. Verify its authenticity by asking for documentation or proof of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be prepared to discuss payment methods and pricing options. Ensure you understand any terms associated with your purchase so there are no surprises later.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After acquiring your account, take time to customize it to fit your brand’s vision before launching it publicly.
        Factors to Consider When Purchasing a Verified Shopify Account
        When considering the purchase of a verified Shopify account, first evaluate its history. Check for any previous issues that may affect your business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next, pay attention to the account&amp;#39;s age. Older accounts often have established credibility and trust within the platform. This can make a significant difference in your store’s success.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Also, analyze the existing inventory or products associated with the account. Ensure they align with your business goals and target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don’t overlook customer reviews and feedback linked to the account. Positive ratings indicate reliability, while negative ones could spell trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ensure proper documentation is available for transfer. Clear ownership rights are crucial when making this investment.
        Tips for Managing Your Verified Shopify Account
        Managing a verified Shopify account effectively can greatly influence your business&amp;#39;s success. Start by regularly updating your product listings. Fresh content keeps customers engaged and boosts SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Monitor analytics daily to understand customer behavior. Insights on traffic sources and sales patterns help tailor marketing strategies for better results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Engage with your audience through social media integration. Promote products, share discounts, or announce new arrivals to build a loyal community around your brand.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Utilize inventory management tools within Shopify to prevent stockouts or overstock situations. A well-managed inventory ensures you meet demand without unnecessary costs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maintain strong security practices. Use two-factor authentication and keep software updated to protect sensitive data from cyber threats while ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers.
        Conclusion and Final Thoughts
        When considering the potential of your online business, investing in a verified Shopify account can significantly enhance your chances of success. This platform is designed to streamline e-commerce operations, making it easier for businesses to establish their presence and grow their sales.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;우선 DP로 푼다면&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;dP[i] = i 를 1로 만들기 위한 최소 연산 횟수 로 두고
        i 에서 할 수 있는 이전 상태는 3가지로 나온다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;i -&amp;gt; i-1 (1을 뺀다) ==&amp;gt; 이전은 dp[i-1] + 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;i -&amp;gt; i/2 (2로 나누어 떨어질 때) ==&amp;gt; 이전은 dp[i//2] + 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;i -&amp;gt; i/3 (3으로 나누어 떨어질 때) ==&amp;gt; 이전은 dp[i//3] + 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;그래서 점화식은
        기본 : dp[1] = 0
        그 외: 
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
        만약 i % 2 ==0 이면 dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i//2] + 1)
        만약 i % 3 ==0 이면 dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i//3] + 1)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import sys
        input = sys.stdin.readline
        
        N = int(input())
        
        dp = [0] * (N + 1)   
        
        for i in range(2, N + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1     
        if i % 2 == 0:
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i // 2] + 1)
        if i % 3 == 0:
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i // 3] + 1)
        
        print(dp[N])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://velog.velcdn.com/images/wonji0942/post/defc9dcc-ddc7-4b17-a97b-737fcbed8aee/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;왜 그리디로는 어렵냐면, 예를 들어 &amp;quot;나눌 수 있으면 무조건 나누기&amp;quot; 같은 그리디를 쓰면, 어떤 수에서는 /3을 먼저 하느냐 /2를 먼저 하느냐가 결과를 바꾸게 된다. DP는 모든 경우를 비교해서 최소를 저장하니까 항상 정답이 된다&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;실제 연산 경로인 10 -&amp;gt; 9 -&amp;gt; 3 -&amp;gt; 1 출력을 하려면
        dp 배열에 최소 횟수를 저장하면서 어디에서 왔는지도 함께 저장하면 된다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;예를 들어 dp[10]이 dp[9] + 1에서 왔다면 -&amp;gt; parent[10] = 9
        이렇게 하면 마지막에 거꾸로 추적할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import sys
        input = sys.stdin.readline
        
        N = int(input())
        
        dp = [0] * (N + 1)
        parent = [0] * (N + 1)
        
        for i in range(2, N + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
        parent[i] = i - 1
        
        if i % 2 == 0 and dp[i] &amp;gt; dp[i // 2] + 1:
        dp[i] = dp[i // 2] + 1
        parent[i] = i // 2
        
        if i % 3 == 0 and dp[i] &amp;gt; dp[i // 3] + 1:
        dp[i] = dp[i // 3] + 1
        parent[i] = i // 3
        
        # 최소 횟수 출력
        print(dp[N])
        
        # 경로 추적
        path = []
        cur = N
        while cur != 0:
        path.append(cur)
        cur = parent[cur]

        Introduction to Paypal Accounts
        PayPal has revolutionized the way we conduct transactions online. It serves as a digital wallet, allowing users to send and receive money with ease. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With millions of active accounts worldwide, PayPal is widely accepted by online retailers, freelancers, and service providers. It simplifies payments for both buyers and sellers while offering an additional layer of security.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Creating a PayPal account is straightforward. Users can link their bank accounts or credit cards for seamless transactions. The platform supports multiple currencies, making it ideal for international dealings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, not all PayPal accounts are created equal. Verified accounts come with added benefits that enhance user experience and credibility in online transactions. This makes them particularly sought after by businesses and individuals alike who want to establish trust in their financial interactions.
        The Benefits of Using Verified Paypal Accounts
        Using verified PayPal accounts offers a range of advantages that can enhance your online transactions. One major benefit is increased security. With a verified account, you have added layers of protection against fraud and unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another key advantage is trustworthiness. Buyers and sellers alike feel more confident transacting with someone who has a verified status. This can lead to smoother interactions and fewer disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover, having a verified account often means higher transaction limits. You won’t be restricted when making larger purchases or receiving payments for goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Access to specific features also improves with verification. For example, you may unlock additional tools for managing your finances or tracking expenses effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Using a verified account helps streamline international transactions, making it easier to send or receive money across borders without the usual hassles associated with unverified accounts.
        How to Buy Verified Paypal Accounts
        When you decide to buy verified PayPal accounts, the first step is research. Look for reputable sellers with positive reviews. This builds trust and ensures you&amp;#39;re not falling into a scam.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next, check their verification process. A legitimate account should have all necessary documentation in place. Ask for proof of identity and verify that it aligns with PayPal&amp;#39;s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve found a trustworthy seller, understand the payment methods they accept. Secure options like cryptocurrency or escrow services can provide added protection during your transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before finalizing your purchase, clarify any terms related to refunds or support after the sale. It&amp;#39;s important to know what happens if issues arise later on.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Always remember to use secure communication channels when sharing personal information during this process. Keeping your details safe is essential in online transactions.

        &lt;p&gt;Evaluate the account&amp;#39;s age and transaction history. An older account with a robust history can offer more reliability than a newly created one.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check for any restrictions or limitations tied to the account. Verify if it has been flagged previously or if there are limits on transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Understand your purpose for buying an account. Whether it&amp;#39;s for business transactions, online shopping, or freelance work, clarity of intention helps in making informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prioritize security measures. Know how to safeguard your new account against potential scams and unauthorized access as soon as you purchase it.

        What is PayPal and why is it important?
        PayPal is a widely recognized online payment platform that enables users to send and receive money securely. Established in 1998, it has evolved into a cornerstone for e-commerce transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The importance of PayPal lies in its convenience. Users can link their bank accounts or credit cards, allowing for quick payments without the hassle of entering financial details repeatedly. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, PayPal’s robust security features protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions. This assurance builds trust between buyers and sellers, making online shopping more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Businesses benefit from integrating PayPal as well; it expands payment options for customers globally. With millions of active accounts, having access to this platform opens doors to new markets and revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As digital commerce continues to grow, understanding the role of PayPal becomes critical for both consumers and entrepreneurs alike.
        The benefits of buying verified PayPal accounts
        Buying verified PayPal accounts comes with several advantages. First, these accounts often have increased credibility. Sellers and buyers alike are more willing to engage in transactions when they see that verification has been established.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another benefit is the ability to send and receive higher transaction limits. Unverified accounts typically impose restrictions that can hinder your business operations or personal dealings. A verified account eliminates those barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Security also plays a vital role. Verified accounts undergo thorough checks by PayPal, which minimizes the risk of fraud for both users and recipients of payments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, having a verified account enhances customer trust. When customers know you use a legitimate payment method, they feel safer making purchases from you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Buying verified PayPal accounts can save time and effort in setting up an account from scratch while ensuring you&amp;#39;re ready to transact immediately.
        How to buy a verified PayPal account
        When looking to buy a verified PayPal account, start by researching reputable sellers. Search online marketplaces and forums where these transactions occur. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ensure the seller has positive reviews. Trustworthy feedback is essential in avoiding scams. Look for sellers who can provide proof of their accounts’ verification status.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you find a potential seller, inquire about the account&amp;#39;s history and usage. Ask questions to understand any limitations or risks associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be prepared to negotiate on price while keeping your budget in mind. After agreeing on terms, use secure payment methods that offer buyer protection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Change all login credentials immediately after purchase for security purposes. This step helps safeguard your new account from unauthorized access and ensures smooth operation moving forward.
        Things to consider before purchasing a verified PayPal account
        Before you buy verified PayPal accounts, consider the source. Ensure that you&amp;#39;re purchasing from a reputable seller. Research their reviews and feedback to gauge reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next, think about security measures. Will you receive all necessary credentials? Verify that the account is indeed verified and not just labeled as such.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pay attention to pricing as well. If an offer seems too good to be true, it often is. Compare prices across multiple platforms for a better understanding of market rates.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, understand the risks involved in using purchased accounts. Familiarize yourself with PayPal&amp;#39;s policies regarding account ownership transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider how you&amp;#39;ll use your new account. Ensure it aligns with your needs—whether for personal use or business transactions—to avoid future complications down the line.
        Alternatives to buying a verified PayPal account
        If buying a verified PayPal account isn’t your preferred route, there are several alternatives worth exploring. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One option is to create your own PayPal account and go through the verification process. It may require some time and patience but ensures authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Using other payment platforms like Stripe or Square can also be beneficial. These services offer similar functionalities with different features that might better suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider utilizing cryptocurrency for transactions as well. Many businesses now accept Bitcoin and other digital currencies, providing flexibility without relying on traditional banking systems.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer payment apps such as Venmo or Cash App can serve as effective substitutes for casual transactions among friends or small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider local online marketplaces that facilitate secure payments without requiring a full-fledged PayPal setup.
        Conclusion
        When considering the purchase of verified PayPal accounts, it’s essential to weigh the benefits against potential risks. Verified accounts enhance your online transactions and build trust with sellers and buyers alike. However, ensure you research thoroughly before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be cautious about where you buy from and always prioritize safety. If purchasing isn’t appealing, explore alternatives like setting up a new account or using other payment platforms that suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Navigating the world of online payments can be complex, but having reliable tools at your disposal simplifies the process significantly. Whether you choose to buy verified PayPal accounts or go another route, staying informed will help you make sound financial decisions moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1 id=&quot;링크-만들기-creating-links&quot;&gt;링크 만들기 (Creating links)&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;링크(하이퍼링크라고도 부르죠!)는 정말 중요해요. 월드 와이드 웹(Web)을 진짜 &amp;#39;거미줄(Web)&amp;#39;처럼 연결해 주는 핵심 요소거든요.
        이 문서에서는 링크를 만들기 위해 필요한 문법을 알아보고, 어떻게 링크를 작성하는 게 좋은지 모범 사례(Best Practices)까지 다뤄볼 거예요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[선수 지식 (Prerequisites)]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax&quot;&gt;기본적인 HTML 문법&lt;/a&gt;에 대한 이해&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs&quot;&gt;제목(Headings)과 단락(paragraphs)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Lists&quot;&gt;목록(lists)&lt;/a&gt; 같은 텍스트 레벨 시맨틱 태그에 대한 지식&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[학습 목표 (Learning outcomes)]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;웹에서 왜 링크가 가장 필수적인 기능인지 이해하기. 링크가 없다면 웹도 없어요!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; 속성이 무엇인지 배우기.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;절대 경로(Absolute paths)와 상대 경로(Relative paths)의 차이점, 그리고 각각 언제 써야 하는지 알아보기.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;슬래시(&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;), 단일 점(&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;), 이중 점(&lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt;) 같은 경로 문법 자세히 파헤치기.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;링크의 상태(&lt;code&gt;:hover&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:focus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:visited&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:active&lt;/code&gt;)와 이것들이 왜 중요한지 이해하기.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;인라인(Inline) 링크와 블록 레벨(Block-level) 링크의 차이점 알아보기.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;화면 낭독기(스크린 리더) 사용자를 위한 접근성 향상, 그리고 긍정적인 검색 엔진 최적화(SEO) 효과 등 &amp;#39;좋은 링크 텍스트&amp;#39;를 작성했을 때의 장점 이해하기.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;하이퍼링크란-무엇일까요-what-is-a-hyperlink&quot;&gt;하이퍼링크란 무엇일까요? (What is a hyperlink?)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;하이퍼링크는 브라우저가 다른 문서나 리소스, 때로는 같은 문서 내의 특정 부분으로 이동하게 만들어주는 HTML 문서의 기능이에요. 클릭하거나 키보드 등으로 활성화할 수 있죠.
        하이퍼링크는 웹이 제공하는 가장 흥미로운 혁신 중 하나예요. 웹의 초창기부터 존재했던 기능이고, 웹을 진짜 &amp;#39;웹(거미줄)&amp;#39;답게 만들어주는 1등 공신이죠.
        웹에 있는 각각의 리소스는 &lt;strong&gt;URL(Uniform Resource Locator)&lt;/strong&gt;이라는 고유한 주소를 가지고 있고, 하이퍼링크는 바로 이 URL을 가리킨답니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 강사님의 보충 설명 &amp;amp; 참고 (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        URL은 HTML 파일뿐만 아니라 텍스트 파일, 이미지, 텍스트 문서, 비디오, 오디오 파일 등 웹에 존재하는 그 어떤 것도 가리킬 수 있어요.
        만약 웹 브라우저가 이 파일을 어떻게 화면에 띄워야 할지, 또는 어떻게 처리해야 할지 모른다면 사용자에게 파일을 열 것인지(이 경우 기기에 설치된 적절한 기본 앱으로 넘어가게 돼요) 아니면 다운로드할 것인지(나중에 사용자가 직접 처리할 수 있도록) 물어볼 거예요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;예를 들어볼까요? 아래 BBC 홈페이지 이미지를 보면 여러 뉴스 기사로 연결되는 링크뿐만 아니라, 사이트의 다른 영역으로 가는 내비게이션 기능, 로그인/가입 페이지(사용자 도구) 등 수많은 링크가 포함되어 있어요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links/updated-bbc-website.png&quot; alt=&quot;BBC 홈페이지 예시 (다양한 뉴스 기사와 내비 메뉴를 보여줌)&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;링크의-구조-anatomy-of-a-link&quot;&gt;링크의 구조 (Anatomy of a link)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;가장 기본적인 형태의 링크는 텍스트나 다른 콘텐츠를 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 요소로 감싸고, 웹 주소를 담고 있는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#href&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 속성을 사용해서 만들어요. 여기서 &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt;는 &lt;strong&gt;Hypertext Reference(하이퍼텍스트 참조)&lt;/strong&gt;의 약자로, 링크의 &lt;strong&gt;목적지(target)&lt;/strong&gt;를 의미한답니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;아래 코드를 볼까요?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        I&amp;#39;m creating a link to
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the Mozilla homepage&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;위 코드를 작성하면 화면에는 다음과 같이 나타납니다:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m creating a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 참고 (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        Scrimba의 &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrimba.com/learn-html-and-css-c0p/~0a?via=mdn&quot;&gt;Anchor tags&lt;/a&gt; 스크림(인터랙티브 강의)에서 HTML로 링크를 만드는 방법을 직접 실습해 볼 수 있어요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👨‍🏫 강사님의 현업 팁:&lt;/strong&gt;
        현업에서는 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 태그를 정말 밥 먹듯이 씁니다. 이때 &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; 속성이 실수로 빠지게 되면 브라우저는 이것을 단순한 텍스트 앵커로 취급해서 클릭할 수 있는 마우스 커서(손가락 모양)로 안 바뀌고, 탭(Tab) 키로 포커스도 잡히지 않아요. 웹 접근성(A11y) 측면에서 큰 문제가 되니 반드시 &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; 속성을 빼먹지 말고 챙겨주세요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;블록-레벨-링크-block-level-links&quot;&gt;블록 레벨 링크 (Block level links)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;앞서 말씀드린 것처럼 거의 모든 콘텐츠를 링크로 만들 수 있어요. 심지어 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block/CSS&quot;&gt;블록 레벨 요소(block-level elements)&lt;/a&gt;도 예외가 아니죠.
        만약 제목(heading) 요소를 통째로 링크로 만들고 싶다면, 아래 코드 스니펫처럼 앵커(&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) 요소로 감싸주기만 하면 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;MDN Web Docs&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Documenting web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, since 2005.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이렇게 하면 큼직한 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 제목 전체가 클릭할 수 있는 링크로 변신해요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👨‍🏫 강사님의 부연 설명:&lt;/strong&gt;
        과거 HTML4 시절에는 인라인 요소인 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 태그 안에 블록 요소인 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;이나 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;를 넣는 것이 문법 규칙 위반이었어요. 하지만 HTML5부터는 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 태그가 감싸는 요소가 인라인이든 블록이든 모두 다 허용하도록 스펙이 발전했답니다. 덕분에 요즘은 쇼핑몰의 &amp;#39;상품 카드&amp;#39; 형태의 레이아웃 전체를 통째로 클릭하게 만들 때 최상위에 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 태그를 넓게 덮어씌우는 기법을 실무에서 굉장히 많이 사용해요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;이미지-링크-image-links&quot;&gt;이미지 링크 (Image links)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이미지를 링크로 만들려면 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 요소를 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 요소로 감싸면 끝이에요. 아래 예시는 로컬(내 컴퓨터/서버)에 저장된 SVG 이미지 파일을 상대 경로로 불러와서 링크로 만드는 방법입니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;/* 이미지가 너무 커지지 않게 CSS로 크기를 살짝 조절해 줍니다 */
        img {
        height: 100px;
        width: 150px;
        border: 1px solid gray;
        }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;mdn_logo.svg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;MDN Web Docs&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이 코드는 MDN 로고 이미지 자체를 클릭할 수 있는 링크로 만들어줘요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 참고 (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        웹에서 이미지를 다루는 더 깊이 있는 방법은 이후에 다뤄질 문서에서 본격적으로 배우게 될 테니 기대해 주세요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;링크에 &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; 속성을 추가하고 싶을 때도 있을 거예요. 이 &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;은 링크에 대한 추가적인 정보(예를 들면 해당 페이지에 어떤 종류의 정보가 담겨 있는지, 혹은 이동하는 사이트에서 주의할 점이 있는지 등)를 담는 역할을 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        I&amp;#39;m creating a link to
        &amp;lt;a
        href=&amp;quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/&amp;quot;
        title=&amp;quot;The best place to find more information about Mozilla&amp;#39;s mission and how to contribute&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        the Mozilla homepage&amp;lt;/a
        &amp;gt;.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이 코드를 실행하고 브라우저에서 링크 위에 마우스를 가만히 올려보세요. &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;에 적었던 내용이 팝업처럼 &amp;quot;툴팁(Tooltip)&amp;quot; 형태로 스르륵 나타날 거예요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚨 주의 사항 (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        링크의 &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;은 오직 마우스를 호버(hover)했을 때만 나타납니다. 즉, 키보드로 웹 서핑을 하거나 스마트폰의 터치스크린을 이용하는 사용자들은 이 &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; 정보를 아예 볼 수 없다는 뜻이죠.
        만약 이 정보가 웹페이지를 이해하는 데 &lt;strong&gt;정말 중요한 핵심 내용&lt;/strong&gt;이라면, 툴팁 안에 꽁꽁 숨겨두지 말고 일반 텍스트로 화면에 바로 보여주어서 모든 사용자가 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 배려해야 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;

        여러분이 작성한 최종 HTML 코드는 아래와 같은 모습이어야 합니다!

        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Squirrels&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Squirrels are commonly thought of as tree-dwelling mammals, but the squirrel
        family extends far beyond that to include ground-dwelling rodents such as
        chipmunks and prairie dogs, and flying squirrels.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
        
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two of the most common and best-known squirrel species are the:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
        
        &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a
        href=&amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel&amp;quot;
        title=&amp;quot;Sciurus vulgaris&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        Red squirrel
        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a
        href=&amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_gray_squirrel&amp;quot;
        title=&amp;quot;Sciurus carolinensis&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        Eastern gray squirrel
        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
        
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        For a good starting point on squirrel information, see the
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Wikipedia Squirrel page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;url과-경로에-대한-간단한-입문-a-quick-primer-on-urls-and-paths&quot;&gt;URL과 경로에 대한 간단한 입문 (A quick primer on URLs and paths)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;링크의 목적지는 항상 URL입니다. URL(Uniform Resource Locator)은 어떤 리소스가 웹의 어디에 위치해 있는지 정확히 정의하는 텍스트 문자열이에요. 예를 들어 모질라의 영문 홈페이지 위치는 &lt;code&gt;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/&lt;/code&gt; 랍니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;웹 서버는 이 URL에 대한 요청(Request)을 받고, 알맞은 리소스로 응답(Response)을 보내줘요. 대부분의 리소스는 서버 컴퓨터의 파일 시스템 안에 파일 형태로 고스란히 저장되어 있기 때문에, URL의 형태는 실제 파일의 경로(file paths)와 아주아주 비슷하게 생겼답니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;

        엄밀히 말하면 &amp;#39;파일 경로&amp;#39;와 &amp;#39;URL&amp;#39;은 똑같은 게 아니에요. 하지만 지금은 여러분의 쉬운 이해를 돕기 위해 둘을 사실상 같은 것이라고 생각하고 설명할게요. 이 둘의 차이점은 아래쪽의 &lt;strong&gt;URL은 어떻게 파일 경로로 변환될까요?&lt;/strong&gt; 섹션에서 더 자세히 다룰 거예요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;서버의 디렉터리(폴더) 구조 예시를 한번 살펴볼까요?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links/simple-directory.png&quot; alt=&quot;간단한 디렉터리 구조. 최상위 디렉터리 이름은 creating-hyperlinks 이며, 그 안에 index.html과 contacts.html, 그리고 projects와 pdfs라는 두 개의 디렉터리가 있습니다. 각각의 내부에는 index.html과 project-brief.pdf 파일이 들어있습니다.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이 디렉터리 구조의 가장 맨 위, 뿌리가 되는 곳을 &lt;strong&gt;루트(root)&lt;/strong&gt;라고 부르고, 이 예시에서는 이름이 &lt;code&gt;creating-hyperlinks&lt;/code&gt;네요. 보통 우리가 웹사이트 작업을 로컬 폴더에서 진행할 때, 사이트 전체를 담고 있는 단 하나의 최상위 디렉터리를 만들게 돼요. 
        이 루트 안에는 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일과 &lt;code&gt;contacts.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일이 있습니다. 실제 웹사이트에서 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;은 보통 홈 페이지(Home page)나 랜딩 페이지(방문자가 처음 도착하는 곳) 역할을 한답니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;루트 디렉터리 안에는 &lt;code&gt;pdfs&lt;/code&gt;와 &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt;라는 두 개의 하위 디렉터리도 있네요. 각각 내부에는 단일 파일이 하나씩 들어있어요. PDF 파일(&lt;code&gt;project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt;)과 또 다른 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일이죠. 여기서 눈여겨볼 점은, 파일이 저장된 위치(경로)만 서로 다르면 한 프로젝트 안에 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;이라는 이름의 파일을 여러 개 만들어도 아무 문제가 없다는 거예요! 두 번째 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;은 아마도 프로젝트 관련 정보만을 담고 있는 서브 메인 랜딩 페이지 역할을 하겠죠.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이제 이 디렉터리 구조 안에서 파일들끼리 링크를 요리조리 걸어보면서, 다양한 &amp;#39;경로 지정 방식&amp;#39;을 연습해 볼게요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;같은-디렉터리-same-directory&quot;&gt;같은 디렉터리 (Same directory)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;만약 최상위 루트에 있는 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일 안에서, 똑같이 최상위에 있는 &lt;code&gt;contacts.html&lt;/code&gt;로 링크를 걸고 싶다면 어떻게 해야 할까요?
        두 파일이 같은 디렉터리에 살고 있으니까, 그저 연결하고 싶은 파일의 이름만 딸랑 적어주면 끝입니다. 사용할 URL은 그저 &lt;code&gt;contacts.html&lt;/code&gt; 이에요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Want to contact a specific staff member? Find details on our
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;contacts.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;contacts page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;같은 디렉터리에 있는 파일의 경로를 표시할 때 점 한 개와 슬래시를 써서 &lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt;로 시작할 수도 있어요. 아래 코드는 바로 위 코드와 완전히 똑같은 동작을 합니다. 어떤 분들은 &lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt;를 명시적으로 써주는 게 &amp;#39;아, 이건 현재 내 위치라는 뜻이구나!&amp;#39; 하고 눈에 확 띄어서 더 선호하기도 하죠.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Want to contact a specific staff member? Find details on our
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;./contacts.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;contacts page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👨‍🏫 강사님의 꿀팁:&lt;/strong&gt;
        사실 단순한 HTML 문서를 넘어서서, 나중에 자바스크립트 모듈(&lt;code&gt;import/export&lt;/code&gt;) 같은 것을 다루실 때는 파일을 불러올 때 &lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt;를 반드시 명시해야만 에러가 나지 않는 경우가 꽤 있어요! 하지만 일반적인 HTML 태그 속성이나 CSS에서는 &lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt;를 과감히 생략하셔도 전혀 문제없으니 마음 편히 작성하세요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;하위-디렉터리로-이동하기-moving-down-into-subdirectories&quot;&gt;하위 디렉터리로 이동하기 (Moving down into subdirectories)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;만약 루트의 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;에서 &lt;code&gt;projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일로 링크를 걸어주고 싶다면요?
        이번에는 목적지 파일의 이름을 적어주기 전에, 먼저 &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt;라는 폴더 안으로 쏙 들어가야 해요. 방법은 간단합니다. 디렉터리 이름을 먼저 쓰고, 슬래시(&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;)를 넣은 다음, 파일 이름을 써주세요. URL은 &lt;code&gt;projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt;이 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Visit my &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;projects/index.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;project homepage&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;상위-디렉터리로-다시-올라가기-moving-back-up-into-parent-directories&quot;&gt;상위 디렉터리로 다시 올라가기 (Moving back up into parent directories)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이번엔 반대로 &lt;code&gt;projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일 내부에서 링크를 걸어서 &lt;code&gt;pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt; 파일로 이동하고 싶다면 어떡할까요?
        현재 &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt; 폴더 안에 갇혀 있으니, 폴더 밖으로 한 칸 빠져나와서(위로 올라가서), 다시 &lt;code&gt;pdfs&lt;/code&gt; 폴더 안으로 내려가야겠죠.
        디렉터리 밖으로 한 칸 위로 올라가려면 &lt;strong&gt;점 두 개 &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;를 사용합니다! 따라서 URL은 &lt;code&gt;../pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt;가 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A link to my &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;../pdfs/project-brief.pdf&amp;quot;&amp;gt;project brief&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 참고 (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        만약 폴더 구조가 아주아주 깊다면, 이 문법들을 연속으로 섞어서 &lt;code&gt;../../../complex/path/to/my/file.html&lt;/code&gt; 처럼 복잡한 경로를 만들어낼 수도 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;루트-디렉터리를-기준으로-링크하기-linking-relative-to-the-root-directory&quot;&gt;루트 디렉터리를 기준으로 링크하기 (Linking relative to the root directory)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;위에서 배운 경로 작성법도 잘 작동하지만, 한 가지 치명적인 단점이 있어요. 링크가 쓰인 파일이든, 링크가 가리키는 대상 파일이든 누군가 실수로 다른 폴더로 옮겨버리면? 네, 경로가 어긋나서 링크가 와장창 깨져버리게 됩니다(엑스박스!).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;내가 링크가 적힌 파일을 어디로 이리저리 옮기든 절대 깨지지 않는 무적의 링크를 만들고 싶다면, 경로의 제일 앞에 &lt;strong&gt;단일 슬래시(&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;를 딱 하나 붙여보세요. 이건 &amp;quot;이 사이트의 가장 최상위 루트 디렉터리부터 경로 탐색을 시작하겠습니다!&amp;quot;라는 뜻이랍니다.
        예를 들어 방금 작성했던 &lt;code&gt;projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 안의 링크를 이렇게 바꿀 수 있어요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A link to my &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&amp;quot;&amp;gt;project brief&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이제 이 경로는 무조건 루트 디렉터리(&lt;code&gt;creating-hyperlinks&lt;/code&gt;)에서 출발해서 -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;pdfs&lt;/code&gt; 폴더로 들어가 -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt; 파일을 찾아냅니다. 만약 여러분이 이 링크 코드를 복사해서 저 깊숙한 곳에 있는 &lt;code&gt;a/b/c/d/e/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일 안에 붙여넣어도 아무 문제 없이 완벽하게 작동할 거예요!
        (물론 대상 파일인 &lt;code&gt;project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt; 자체를 다른 곳으로 옮겨버리면 그땐 링크가 깨지겠죠?)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;웹 개발을 하다 보면 앞으로 정말 귀에 딱지가 앉도록 듣게 될 용어 두 가지를 여기서 정리해 드릴게요. 바로 &lt;strong&gt;절대 경로(Absolute path)&lt;/strong&gt;와 &lt;strong&gt;상대 경로(Relative path)&lt;/strong&gt;입니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;절대 경로 (Absolute path):&lt;/strong&gt; 내 사이트 (또는 웹상의 어딘가)에 정의된 절대적이고 고정적인 위치를 가리켜요. 방금 본 예시처럼 맨 앞에 슬래시를 써서 &lt;code&gt;/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt; 라고 적어주면, 사이트 루트를 기준으로 변하지 않는 절대 경로가 됩니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;상대 경로 (Relative path):&lt;/strong&gt; 이 링크 코드가 작성되어 있는 &amp;#39;현재 파일&amp;#39;의 위치를 기준으로 상대적인 위치를 가리켜요. 앞서 다룬 &lt;code&gt;projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 처럼 작성하면 현재 위치에서 출발하는 상대 경로가 되죠. 만약 현재 파일을 다른 폴더로 옮기면 출발지가 바뀌므로 대상이 가리키는 절대 위치도 덩달아 달라지게 됩니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👨‍🏫 강사님의 부연 설명:&lt;/strong&gt;
        사실 &amp;#39;절대 경로&amp;#39;라는 용어는 상황에 따라 일관되지 않게 쓰일 때도 있어요. &lt;code&gt;/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt;는 내 파일의 위치와 상관없는 고정 경로이긴 하지만, 결국 사이트의 &amp;#39;도메인 이름(예: &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;)&amp;#39;을 기준으로 삼고 있죠. 진정한 의미의 &amp;#39;웹 전체를 기준으로 한 절대 경로&amp;#39;는 &lt;code&gt;https://example.com/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt; 처럼 http 프로토콜부터 도메인 주소까지 전체를 풀(full)로 적어준 것을 말한답니다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;전체-url로-링크하기-linking-with-full-urls&quot;&gt;전체 URL로 링크하기 (Linking with full URLs)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;아예 전체 URL을 꽉 채워서 경로로 지정할 수도 있어요. 이렇게 작성하면 이 링크 코드를 어디에 갖다 쓰든 간에, 무조건 웹상의 똑같은 위치를 가리키게 되죠.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.example.com/projects/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이 링크는 여러분이 나중에 사이트를 아예 다른 도메인으로 이사하더라도 무조건 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/projects/&lt;/code&gt;로만 연결될 거예요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;내부-링크와-외부-링크-internal-and-external-links&quot;&gt;내부 링크와 외부 링크 (Internal and external links)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;내부 링크 (Internal link):&lt;/strong&gt; 링크가 &lt;em&gt;내&lt;/em&gt; 웹사이트 안에 있는 리소스(페이지, 이미지 등)를 가리킬 때 부르는 말이에요.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;외부 링크 (External link):&lt;/strong&gt; 링크가 내 사이트가 아닌 &lt;em&gt;다른&lt;/em&gt; 남의 사이트를 가리킬 때 부르는 말이죠.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;외부 링크를 지정할 때는 무조건 전체 URL을 경로로 다 적어줘야 해요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.some-other-site.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt;나 &lt;code&gt;projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 같은 상대 경로로는 다른 웹사이트를 가리킬 수 없어요. 이 녀석들은 내 사이트 내부에서 길을 찾는 방식이고, 브라우저가 남의 서버까지 바다 건너 찾아가려면 그 사이트의 정확한 도메인 이름을 알아야 하거든요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;반면 내부 링크를 걸 때는 상대 경로, 절대 경로, 전체 URL 뭘 써도 상관이 없습니다. 아래 두 코드는 결국 똑같은 곳을 가리켜요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.example.com/projects/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;projects&amp;quot;&amp;gt;projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;하지만 가급적 &lt;strong&gt;두 번째 방법처럼 전체 도메인을 뺀 경로를 쓰시길 강력히 권장&lt;/strong&gt;해요!
        이유가 뭐냐고요? 바로 &lt;strong&gt;이식성(Portability)&lt;/strong&gt; 때문입니다. 도메인까지 하드코딩해서 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/projects/&lt;/code&gt; 라고 박아두면, 나중에 내 사이트 이름이 &lt;code&gt;another-example.com&lt;/code&gt;으로 바뀌었을 때 내부에 적어둔 모든 URL 링크들을 일일이 찾아다니며 수정해야 하는 끔찍한 막노동을 해야 하거든요. 도메인을 빼고 상대경로나 루트 경로를 적어두면 사이트 주소가 바뀌어도 아무 수정 없이 알아서 잘 작동합니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;문서-조각--앵커-document-fragments&quot;&gt;문서 조각 / 앵커 (Document fragments)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;링크를 누르면 항상 문서의 맨 꼭대기로만 이동하는 건 아니에요. HTML 문서 내의 특정한 위치로 슝~ 하고 건너뛰게 만들 수 있는데, 이를 &lt;strong&gt;문서 조각(Document fragment)&lt;/strong&gt; 또는 &lt;strong&gt;앵커&lt;/strong&gt;라고 부릅니다.
        문서 안의 특정 HTML 요소에 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 속성을 달아주면, 그곳으로 다이렉트로 날아갈 수 있는 문서 조각 링크가 자동으로 만들어집니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;가장 흔하게 쓰이는 패턴은 특정 제목(Heading)으로 건너뛰게 하는 거예요. 이렇게 말이죠.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2 id=&amp;quot;mailing_address&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Mailing address&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;특정 &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;가 있는 곳으로 링크를 걸려면, 경로의 맨 마지막에 &lt;strong&gt;해시(우물 정) 기호 &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;를 붙이고 그 뒤에 해당 id 이름을 적어주면 됩니다!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Want to write us a letter? Use our
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;contacts.html#mailing_address&amp;quot;&amp;gt;mailing address&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;놀랍게도 파일 경로를 아예 빼버리고 문서 조각 참조(&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;)만 단독으로 써서 &lt;strong&gt;현재 보고 있는 문서 안의 다른 부분으로 스크롤 이동&lt;/strong&gt;하게 만들 수도 있어요! 스크롤이 끝도 없이 긴 페이지에서 &amp;quot;맨 위로 가기&amp;quot; 같은 버튼을 만들 때 정말 유용하답니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        The &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#mailing_address&amp;quot;&amp;gt;company mailing address&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; can be found at the
        bottom of this page.
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;url은-어떻게-파일-경로로-변환될까요-how-do-urls-translate-into-file-paths&quot;&gt;URL은 어떻게 파일 경로로 변환될까요? (How do URLs translate into file paths?)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;지금까지 우리가 살펴본 링크의 목적지들은 모두 웹 서버가 찰떡같이 처리해서 해당 리소스를 찾아주는 &lt;em&gt;URL&lt;/em&gt;이었어요. 
        중요한 사실 하나! &lt;strong&gt;웹 콘텐츠는 절대로 서버의 진짜 파일 시스템 구조를 직접 들여다볼 수 없습니다.&lt;/strong&gt; (보안상 아주 당연한 일이죠!)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;지금까지 우리가 가정한 서버 예시는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSG&quot;&gt;정적 웹사이트(Static website)&lt;/a&gt;였어요. 정적 서버는 URL에서 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/pathname&quot;&gt;경로명(pathname)&lt;/a&gt; 부분만 쏙 빼서, 서버 컴퓨터의 파일 시스템 내부에 일치하는 파일이 있는지 있는 그대로 1:1 매칭시켜 찾아줍니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 참고 (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        실제로는 정적 파일을 보내주기보다는, 사용자가 요청한 URL에 맞춰서 그때그때 코드를 실행해 콘텐츠를 찍어내서(동적으로) 보내주는 서버가 훨씬 많아요. 나중에 여러분이 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries&quot;&gt;웹 프레임워크&lt;/a&gt;를 쓰게 되면, 여러분이 코딩하는 소스 코드 폴더 구조와 실제 서버로 배포되는 구조가 완전히 달라지는 경험을 하시게 될 겁니다. 여러분의 웹사이트가 원활히 돌아가게 하려면, 내가 작성한 URL이 어떻게 소스 파일로 매핑되는지 본인의 빌드 도구와 서버 환경 설정을 잘 이해하고 있어야 해요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;자, 만약 도메인 이름이 &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;이고, 우리가 만든 샘플 폴더를 루트로 삼아서 로컬 테스트 서버를 켰다고 해볼게요.
        그러면 &lt;code&gt;pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt; 파일은 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt; 라는 URL로 세상에 공개됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;모든 링크는 현재 머물고 있는 문서의 URL을 기준으로 경로를 계산해요. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;도메인이 &lt;code&gt;https://example.com&lt;/code&gt;인 상황에서 &lt;code&gt;/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt;라는 절대 경로 링크를 걸면, 브라우저는 무조건 경로명이 &lt;code&gt;/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt;인 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/pdfs/project-brief.pdf&lt;/code&gt;로 찾아갑니다. 서버는 루트 디렉터리에서 &lt;code&gt;pdfs&lt;/code&gt; 폴더를 찾고, 그 안에서 해당 파일을 꺼내주죠.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 같은 상대 경로 링크는 이 코드를 어디에 작성했냐에 따라 결과가 확 달라집니다. 최상위 루트에 있는 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;이나 &lt;code&gt;contacts.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일 안에서 불렀다면 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt;로 잘 가겠죠. 하지만 만약 &lt;code&gt;pdfs/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일 안에서 이 링크를 불렀다면? 브라우저는 현재 위치에서 출발해서 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/pdfs/projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt;을 찾으려 할 테고, 그런 폴더는 존재하지 않으니 (404 Not Found) 깨진 링크가 되어버립니다!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h4 id=&quot;기본-indexhtml-페이지의-마법&quot;&gt;기본 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; 페이지의 마법&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; 파일로 링크를 걸 때는 보통 URL 끝에 굳이 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;이라고 파일명까지 구구절절 써줄 필요가 없어요. 웹 서버는 파일명이 생략되었을 때, &amp;quot;아! 기본 랜딩 페이지인 &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;을 찾는 거구나!&amp;quot; 하고 알아서 찾아 보여주도록 기본 세팅이 되어 있거든요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;그래서 아까 작성했던 &lt;code&gt;projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt; 경로의 예시를 보면, 그냥 짧게 &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt; 라고만 적어도 완벽하게 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/projects/index.html&lt;/code&gt;로 연결된답니다! 우리가 웹 브라우저 주소창에 들어갈 때도 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/projects/&lt;/code&gt; 라고만 쳐도 원하는 페이지가 뿅 하고 나오게 되죠.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚨 중요: 후행 슬래시(Trailing slash) (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        여기서 아주 조심해야 할 꿀팁 하나! URL 맨 끝에 붙는 슬래시(&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;)는 겉보기엔 작아 보여도 엄청난 차이를 만듭니다. 
        만약 주소창에 슬래시가 있는 상태인 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/projects/&lt;/code&gt;에 머물고 있을 때, 상대 경로로 &lt;code&gt;contacts.html&lt;/code&gt;을 불렀다고 쳐볼게요. 브라우저는 &amp;quot;projects 폴더 안에 있는 파일이구나!&amp;quot; 하고 인식해서 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/projects/contacts.html&lt;/code&gt;을 정상적으로 찾아냅니다.
        그런데 끝에 슬래시가 빠져서 브라우저 주소가 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/projects&lt;/code&gt; 였다면? 브라우저는 &amp;quot;어라? &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt;가 폴더 이름이 아니라 파일 이름인가 보네?&amp;quot; 하고 착각해서 그 위 폴더인 &lt;code&gt;https://www.example.com/contacts.html&lt;/code&gt; (루트 위치)를 찾아버리게 되고, 결국 상대 링크가 망가지게 됩니다. 
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/slorber/trailing-slash-guide&quot;&gt;웹 서버들마다 이 마지막 슬래시를 처리하는 방식이 천차만별&lt;/a&gt;이니 이 원리를 꼭 기억해 두세요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;링크-모범-사례-link-best-practices&quot;&gt;링크 모범 사례 (Link best practices)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;링크를 작성할 때 꼭 지키면 좋은, 현업에서 통용되는 베스트 프랙티스(모범 사례)들을 알아볼게요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;명확한-링크-문구-사용하기-use-clear-link-wording&quot;&gt;명확한 링크 문구 사용하기 (Use clear link wording)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;화면에 아무렇게나 링크를 띡 던져놓는 건 너무 쉬운 일이죠. 하지만 진정한 프론트엔드 개발자라면 그걸로 만족해선 안 됩니다! 우리는 현재 처한 상황이나 사용하는 기기에 상관없이 &lt;strong&gt;누구나&lt;/strong&gt; 이 링크에 쉽게 접근(Accessible)할 수 있게 만들어야 해요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;화면 낭독기(Screen reader) 사용자들은 보통 페이지 전체를 순서대로 읽기보다, 화면을 스킵하며 페이지 안의 링크들만 징검다리 건너듯 넘나들며 정보를 파악하는 걸 좋아해요.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;검색 엔진 봇들은 이 링크의 텍스트(Anchor text)를 분석해서 대상 파일이 무엇인지 색인(Indexing)합니다. 그래서 목적지를 잘 설명하는 핵심 키워드를 링크 텍스트에 녹여내면 검색 랭킹(SEO) 향상에 아주 긍정적인 영향을 줍니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;눈으로 화면을 보는 일반 사용자들도 글을 정독하기보단 휙휙 스캐닝하듯 훑어보는데, 보통 색깔이 튀고 밑줄이 그어져 있는 링크로 눈길이 가게 마련이죠. 이들에게 잘 쓰인 링크 텍스트는 큰 도움이 됩니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;직접 비교해 볼까요?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;👍 &lt;strong&gt;좋은 예시:&lt;/strong&gt; 목적지가 명확합니다. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firefox.com/en-US/?redirect_source=firefox-com&quot;&gt;Download Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;👎 &lt;strong&gt;나쁜 예시:&lt;/strong&gt; 앞뒤 문맥을 안 읽으면 어디로 가는지 알 수가 없습니다. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firefox.com/en-US/&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to download Firefox&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👨‍🏫 강사님의 꿀팁 4가지:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL 전체 주소를 그대로 링크 텍스트로 쓰지 마세요.&lt;/strong&gt; 너무 못생겨 보일 뿐만 아니라, 화면 낭독기가 &amp;quot;에이치 티 티 피 에스 콜론 슬래시 슬래시...&amp;quot; 하면서 한 글자씩 또박또박 다 읽어주는 고문을 선사하게 됩니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;여기를 클릭하세요(Click here)&amp;quot; 또는 &amp;quot;이 링크(Link)&amp;quot; 같은 말은 제발 피해주세요!&lt;/strong&gt; 쓸데없는 잡음일 뿐이에요. 시각 장애인용 화면 낭독기는 이미 자체적으로 &amp;quot;이건 링크입니다&amp;quot;라고 알려줍니다. 거기다 대고 또 링크라고 말할 필요가 없어요. 화면을 볼 수 있는 사용자들도 파란색과 밑줄이라는 관습적인 스타일을 보고 링크인 걸 이미 직관적으로 안답니다. (이런 스타일 관습은 사용자들이 익숙해져 있으니 함부로 깨지 않는 것이 좋아요.)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;링크 텍스트는 가능한 한 짧고 간결하게 쓰세요.&lt;/strong&gt; 화면 낭독기가 긴 텍스트를 끝까지 다 읽고 해석해야 하는 수고를 덜어줄 수 있습니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;한 페이지 안에 똑같은 텍스트(&amp;quot;여기 클릭&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;여기 클릭&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;여기 클릭&amp;quot;...)를 가진 링크가 각기 다른 곳을 가리키게 두지 마세요.&lt;/strong&gt; 화면 낭독기 사용자가 앞뒤 문맥 없이 &amp;quot;여기 클릭&amp;quot;이라는 목록만 쭉 듣는다고 상상해 보세요. 뭐가 뭔지 도저히 구분이 안 갈 겁니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;비-html-리소스에-링크하기---명확한-안내-표지판-세워주기-linking-to-non-html-resources--leave-clear-signposts&quot;&gt;비 HTML 리소스에 링크하기 - 명확한 안내 표지판 세워주기 (Linking to non-HTML resources — leave clear signposts)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;웹페이지로 자연스럽게 이동하는 일반적인 내비게이션이 아니라, 무언가 사용자가 예상치 못한 일이 벌어질 것 같은 링크라면? &lt;strong&gt;링크 텍스트 안에 어떤 일이 일어날지 명확하게 미리 알려주는 센스&lt;/strong&gt;가 필요합니다! 
        예를 들어 파일을 다운로드하거나 비디오를 스트리밍할 때, 혹은 갑자기 팝업창이 뜨거나 하는 경우라면 그 사실을 텍스트에 꼭 적어주세요. 
        데이터 요금제가 넉넉지 않거나 느린 환경에 있는 사용자가 뭣도 모르고 수십 메가바이트짜리 파일을 다운받는 불상사를 피할 수 있겠죠. 또한 갑자기 새 탭이 열리거나 다운로드가 시작되었을 때 상황 파악이 안 돼 당황할 수 있는 화면 낭독기 사용자들에게 훌륭한 마음의 준비(?)를 시켜줄 수 있답니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/large-report.pdf&amp;quot; download&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
        
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.example.com/video-stream/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        Watch the video (stream opens in separate tab, HD quality)
        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;다운로드-링크에-download-속성-사용하기-use-the-download-attribute-when-linking-to-a-download&quot;&gt;다운로드 링크에 download 속성 사용하기 (Use the download attribute when linking to a download)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;링크가 단순히 웹 브라우저 화면에서 열리는 게 아니라 무언가 파일을 다운로드하게 만들고 싶을 때는 &lt;code&gt;download&lt;/code&gt; 속성을 써주면 아주 유용합니다. 이 속성에 값을 지정해주면, 사용자가 파일을 다운로드할 때 &amp;#39;기본으로 저장될 파일 이름&amp;#39;까지 우리가 예쁘게 정해줄 수 있거든요!
        아래는 최신 버전의 Windows용 Firefox 브라우저 설치 파일을 다운로드하는 예시입니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a
        href=&amp;quot;https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&amp;amp;os=win64&amp;amp;lang=en-US&amp;quot;
        download=&amp;quot;firefox-latest-64bit-installer.exe&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)
        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;새-탭에서-링크를-열어야-할-때-when-to-open-links-in-a-new-tab&quot;&gt;새 탭에서 링크를 열어야 할 때 (When to open links in a new tab)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;웹에서 링크는 기본적으로 사용자가 머물고 있던 현재 탭(창)에서 그대로 이동하게 설정되어 있습니다. 덕분에 브라우저의 &amp;#39;뒤로 가기&amp;#39; 버튼을 눌러서 언제든 쉽게 이전 페이지로 돌아올 수 있죠.
        하지만 MDN을 비롯한 수많은 사이트들은 특정 링크(특히 외부 링크!)를 &lt;strong&gt;새 탭&lt;/strong&gt;에서 열리게 만듭니다. 이럴 때는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a#target&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 속성을 &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;로 설정해주면 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;Firefox is developed by the
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Mozilla Foundation&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;하지만 링크를 새 탭으로 띄우는 건 사용자 경험(UX) 디자인 측면에서 아주 신중하게 생각하고 결정해야 할 문제예요. 고려해야 할 점들을 알려드릴게요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;새 탭으로 열면 두 개의 문서를 동시에 화면에 띄워놓고 &amp;quot;나란히(parallel)&amp;quot; 볼 수 있다는 장점이 있습니다. 반면, 현재 탭에서 바로 이동하는 것은 현재 흐름이 쭈욱 이어지는 &amp;quot;연장선(continuation)&amp;quot; 같은 느낌을 줍니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;뒤로 가기 버튼을 누르는 데 익숙해져 있는 사용자들은, 새 탭이 열린 줄 모르고 무의식적으로 뒤로 가기를 눌렀다가 안 먹혀서 멘붕에 빠질 수 있습니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;일반 링크라도 사용자가 원한다면 키보드 단축키(Ctrl+클릭)나 마우스 우클릭 메뉴를 써서 본인 마음대로 새 탭에서 열 수 있습니다. 반대로 개발자가 강제로 새 탭(&lt;code&gt;_blank&lt;/code&gt;)을 박아버리면, 사용자가 억지로 현재 탭에서 열게 하기는 아주 힘듭니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;화면 낭독기 사용자들은 탭이 새로 열렸다는 사실조차 눈치채지 못할 수 있어서, 내가 지금 웹페이지의 어디쯤 있는지 문맥을 잃어버리고 혼란스러워할 수 있습니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👨‍🏫 강사님의 현업 팁:&lt;/strong&gt;
        그래서 보통 프론트엔드 디자인 업계에서는 &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;내 사이트 안에서 돌아다니는 내부 링크는 현재 탭에서 열고, 아예 밖으로 나가는 외부 링크는 새 탭에서 연다&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;는 암묵적인 룰을 많이 따릅니다.
        (물론 어떤 디자이너들은 모든 링크를 무조건 현재 탭에서 열게 고집하기도 해요!)
        만약 새 탭에서 열리는 링크를 쓴다면, 사용자에게 &amp;quot;이거 누르면 새 창이 뜰 거야!&amp;quot;라는 힌트를 줄 수 있도록 링크 텍스트 옆에 ↗️ 이런 작은 아이콘을 붙여주시는 걸 강력히 추천합니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;내비게이션-메뉴-만들기-creating-a-navigation-menu&quot;&gt;내비게이션 메뉴 만들기 (Creating a navigation menu)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;실습 시간입니다! 여러 개의 HTML 파일을 만들고 내비게이션 메뉴(메뉴바)로 서로를 연결해서, 진짜 그럴싸한 다중 페이지 웹사이트를 한번 만들어 볼까요?
        실제 웹사이트들이 가장 흔하게 사용하는 방식이에요. 똑같은 레이아웃과 내비게이션 메뉴 코드를 모든 페이지에 공통으로 붙여놓고, 링크를 누르면 이동하게 해서 사용자 입장에서는 마치 제자리에 가만히 있고 가운데 알맹이(콘텐츠)만 다른 것으로 바뀌는 것 같은 느낌을 주는 거죠.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;로컬 폴더를 하나 만드시고 아래 4개의 파일 사본을 다운받아 같은 곳에 넣어주세요. 전체 원본 코드는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start&quot;&gt;navigation-menu-start (GitHub)&lt;/a&gt;에서 보실 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/index.html&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/a&gt; (홈)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/projects.html&quot;&gt;projects.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/pictures.html&quot;&gt;pictures.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/social.html&quot;&gt;social.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;여러분이 하실 일은 다음과 같습니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;한 페이지의 지정된 위치에 순서 없는 목록(&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) 태그를 추가하고, 그 안에 우리가 이동할 페이지 이름들을 쭉 적어봅니다. 내비게이션 메뉴는 의미론적으로(Semantically) &amp;quot;링크들의 목록&amp;quot;에 불과하므로, 이렇게 리스트 태그를 쓰는 게 아주 정석적인 방법이에요.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;적어둔 각 페이지 이름을 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 태그로 묶어서 링크로 변신시켜주세요.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;완성된 내비게이션 메뉴 코드를 나머지 페이지들에도 복사해서 쫙 붙여넣습니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(핵심!)&lt;/strong&gt; 각각의 페이지에 가서, &lt;strong&gt;자기 자신을 가리키는 링크는 지워주세요.&lt;/strong&gt; 예를 들어 사진 페이지에선 &amp;#39;Pictures&amp;#39; 링크를 지우는 거죠. 지금 머물고 있는 페이지를 가리키는 링크는 헷갈리고 아무 쓸모가 없거든요! 게다가 링크가 사라진 걸 보면 사용자가 &amp;quot;아, 내가 지금 이 페이지에 들어와 있구나!&amp;quot; 하고 바로 알아차릴 수 있는 아주 훌륭한 시각적 알리미 역할도 해줍니다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;성공적으로 완성했다면 아래 이미지와 비슷한 모양이 될 거예요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links/navigation-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;HTML 내비게이션 메뉴 예시 이미지. home, pictures, projects, social 메뉴가 보입니다.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 참고 (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        혼자 하다가 막히거나, 내가 한 게 맞는지 확인해보고 싶다면 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-marked-up&quot;&gt;navigation-menu-marked-up (GitHub)&lt;/a&gt; 디렉터리에 있는 정답 코드를 슬쩍 커닝해 보세요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;이메일-링크-email-links&quot;&gt;이메일 링크 (Email links)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;웹사이트에 어떤 웹페이지 주소가 아니라, 클릭하자마자 사용자의 이메일 앱(Outlook 등)이 팟! 하고 켜지면서 새 메일 쓰기 창이 나오게 하는 링크도 만들 수 있어요.
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/a&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 요소와 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;mailto:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 라는 URL 스킴(Scheme)을 사용하면 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;가장 흔하게 쓰이는 기본 형태는 받는 사람의 이메일 주소를 명시해 두는 거예요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Send email to nowhere&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;클릭하면 이렇게 보입니다 👉 &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org&quot;&gt;Send email to nowhere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;사실 이메일 주소는 안 적어도 상관없어요. 받는 사람을 비워두고 그냥 &lt;code&gt;href=&amp;quot;mailto:&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; 라고만 적어두면, 사용자의 메일 앱에서 빈 새 이메일 창이 열리게 됩니다. 사용자가 메일 주소를 직접 적어서 아무한테나 내 사이트를 공유하게 만드는 &amp;quot;공유하기&amp;quot; 버튼을 만들 때 은근히 유용하게 쓰이죠.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;세부-정보-지정하기-specifying-details&quot;&gt;세부 정보 지정하기 (Specifying details)&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이메일 주소뿐만 아니라 이메일에 들어갈 여러 가지 옵션(표준 메일 헤더 필드)들을 링크 하나에 미리 다 세팅해 둘 수 있어요!
        가장 많이 쓰이는 옵션은 &amp;quot;참조(cc)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;숨은 참조(bcc)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;제목(subject)&amp;quot;, 그리고 메일에 미리 적혀있을 &amp;quot;메일 내용(body)&amp;quot;입니다. (body는 엄밀히 말해 헤더 필드는 아니지만 많이 쓰여요.)
        이 값들은 URL 끝에 쿼리 파라미터(Query term) 방식으로 덧붙이게 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;참조, 숨은 참조, 제목, 내용까지 알차게 다 넣어본 예시를 볼까요?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a
        href=&amp;quot;mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=name2@rapidtables.com&amp;amp;bcc=name3@rapidtables.com&amp;amp;subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&amp;amp;body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚨 주의 사항 (Note):&lt;/strong&gt;
        위 코드에서 &lt;code&gt;%20&lt;/code&gt; 같은 요상한 기호가 보이시나요? URL에는 띄어쓰기(공백)나 탭, 줄바꿈 같은 눈에 안 보이는 출력 불가 특수 기호를 있는 그대로 쓸 수 없기 때문에, 이를 웹이 알아먹을 수 있는 문자로 치환해 줘야 합니다. 이를 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding&quot;&gt;퍼센트 인코딩(URL 인코딩)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;이라고 불러요. 스페이스바(공백)는 &lt;code&gt;%20&lt;/code&gt;으로 맵핑되죠.
        또한, 첫 번째 옵션을 시작할 때는 물음표(&lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;)로 메인 URL과 구분해주고, 두 번째 옵션부터는 앰퍼샌드(&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;)를 써서 값들을 이어붙인다는 점을 눈여겨보세요! 이것이 웹 표준 URL 쿼리 표기법입니다. 이 개념은 나중에 폼(Form) 데이터를 다룰 때 배우게 될 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data#the_get_method&quot;&gt;GET 메서드 (The GET method)&lt;/a&gt; 파트에서 왜 이렇게 쓰는지 훨씬 깊게 이해하실 수 있을 거예요.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;여기 몇 가지 다른 형태의 &lt;code&gt;mailto&lt;/code&gt; URL 샘플들이 있으니 구조를 익혀두세요!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&quot;&gt;mailto:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s better than having one Telegram account? You guessed it—multiple accounts! Imagine tapping into various marketing strategies, reaching different demographics, or promoting diverse products all under the umbrella of this versatile platform. This is where buying Telegram accounts comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#39;re an entrepreneur trying to expand your brand&amp;#39;s reach or a marketer exploring new avenues, understanding how to buy Telegram accounts can open up doors you never knew existed. Let&amp;#39;s dive deeper into why investing in these accounts could be your next game-changing move.
        Buy Telegram Accounts
        Buying Telegram accounts is becoming increasingly popular among businesses and marketers. The appeal lies in the ability to manage multiple channels, each tailored for specific audiences or campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you purchase these accounts, you gain immediate access to established user bases. This means less time building a following from scratch and more time focusing on your messaging and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, having several accounts allows for targeted marketing efforts. You can segment content based on demographics or interests, ensuring that your audience receives relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s crucial to approach this process wisely. Not all sources are reliable; choosing reputable vendors ensures safety and compliance with Telegram&amp;#39;s guidelines. Always prioritize quality over quantity when considering options for buying Telegram accounts.
        Introduction to Telegram
        Telegram is a cloud-based messaging platform that has gained immense popularity in recent years. It stands out for its robust security features and user-friendly interface. With over 500 million active users, it offers a unique blend of speed and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional messaging apps, Telegram allows users to create channels and groups with unlimited members. This makes it an excellent tool for businesses looking to engage large audiences effortlessly. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Its focus on privacy appeals to many who seek secure communication options. Users can send encrypted messages, voice calls, photos, videos, and documents without worrying about third-party access.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the app supports bots that can automate tasks or provide information instantly. The versatility of Telegram positions it as more than just a chat application; it’s rapidly becoming a vital business tool in digital marketing strategies worldwide.
        Why Buy Telegram Accounts?
        Buying Telegram accounts can significantly enhance your business outreach. It allows you to tap into diverse audiences with tailored messages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having multiple accounts is a strategic advantage. You can segment your marketing efforts, catering to different demographics or interests without overwhelming followers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Privacy also plays a key role. Using various accounts helps maintain anonymity for businesses that prefer to keep their personal and professional lives separate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, purchasing established accounts often means gaining access to pre-existing networks. This instant audience can accelerate engagement and interaction right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In an age where communication channels are vital for brand recognition, owning several Telegram accounts positions your business as versatile and accessible across various niches.
        Benefits of Buying Telegram Accounts
        Buying Telegram accounts offers a strategic advantage for businesses looking to expand their reach. With a multitude of accounts, brands can tap into different niches and target diverse audiences effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having multiple accounts allows for tailored content delivery. Each account can be customized to engage specific demographics, resulting in higher interaction rates and better customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another benefit is the ability to test various marketing strategies simultaneously. This flexibility helps identify what resonates best with your audience without risking your primary account&amp;#39;s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, buying established accounts means gaining instant credibility. These accounts often come with existing followers who trust the brand, providing an immediate platform for promotion and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You save time on organic growth efforts. By purchasing ready-to-use Telegram accounts, businesses can focus more on crafting quality content rather than spending countless hours building follower bases from scratch.

        &lt;p&gt;How to Buy Telegram Accounts
        Buying Telegram accounts can be straightforward if you know where to look. Begin by researching reputable sellers online. Look for platforms that specialize in social media account sales and have positive reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve identified a few potential sources, evaluate their offerings carefully. Check the number of followers, engagement rates, and any available analytics to ensure quality.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s crucial to communicate with the seller before making a purchase. Ask questions about the account’s history and usage policies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When ready to buy, use secure payment methods like PayPal or credit cards that offer buyer protection. This adds an extra layer of security to your transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After purchasing, take time to familiarize yourself with the account settings and guidelines for optimal use. Managing it effectively from day one sets you up for success in your marketing endeavors on this versatile platform.
        Best Places to Buy Telegram Accounts
        When looking to buy Telegram accounts, the choices can be overwhelming. However, there are reliable platforms that stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, consider specialized online marketplaces. These sites often provide verified accounts and customer support. User reviews can also guide your decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another option is social media management tools. Some services offer pre-made Telegram accounts as part of their packages tailored for businesses aiming at outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forums dedicated to digital marketing may have listings or recommendations from experienced users who share their insights on trustworthy sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Always do thorough research before making a purchase. It’s crucial to ensure that you’re dealing with reputable vendors to avoid scams or issues down the line.
        Introduction to Telegram and its Potential for Businesses
        Telegram is more than just a messaging app; it&amp;#39;s a powerful tool for businesses. With its robust features, companies can engage directly with customers and build communities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Its channels allow brands to broadcast messages to unlimited subscribers, making it perfect for announcements or promotions. Groups facilitate discussions among followers, fostering loyalty and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The platform supports bots that automate tasks and provide customer service around the clock. This means businesses can streamline operations while enhancing user experience simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What sets Telegram apart is its emphasis on privacy and security. This attracts users who value confidentiality in their communications, creating a trustworthy environment for brand engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the digital landscape evolves, leveraging Telegram&amp;#39;s potential could be key to staying competitive. Many organizations are already tapping into this unique space to enhance visibility and connect with audiences effectively.
        The Importance of Having Multiple Telegram Accounts for Marketing Purposes
        Having multiple Telegram accounts can greatly enhance your marketing strategy. This approach allows businesses to segment their audience effectively. Each account can cater to different demographics or niches, ensuring targeted communication.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover, managing various campaigns becomes easier with distinct accounts. You can experiment with diverse content styles and promotional offers tailored for specific groups.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multiple accounts also help maintain brand integrity. By separating personal interactions from business communications, you create a more professional image in the eyes of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, using several accounts aids in geographic targeting. Companies can focus on local markets or regions by creating dedicated channels that speak directly to those audiences’ interests and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It provides flexibility in crisis management. If one account faces an issue or is flagged for any reason, others remain operational while addressing concerns swiftly and efficiently.
        Benefits of Buying Telegram Accounts
        Buying Telegram accounts offers a unique advantage for businesses and marketers. These accounts provide immediate access to established networks, allowing for instant engagement with potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With multiple accounts, targeting diverse audiences becomes seamless. You can tailor your messaging to suit different demographics or interests, maximizing outreach effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another benefit is the time saved in building an audience from scratch. Instead of waiting weeks or months for organic growth, purchased accounts come pre-equipped with followers who are already interested in relevant topics.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, owning several Telegram accounts aids in managing brand presence across various niches. This strategy enhances brand visibility and allows companies to experiment with distinct marketing strategies without risking their main account’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having multiple accounts helps mitigate risks associated with platform restrictions. If one account faces issues, others remain functional—ensuring continuity in communication efforts.
        How to Buy Telegram Accounts Safely and Legally
        When purchasing Telegram accounts, prioritize safety and legality. Start by researching reputable vendors who specialize in social media account sales. Look for user reviews and feedback to gauge their reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ensure that the accounts you intend to buy adhere to Telegram’s terms of service. This helps avoid potential bans or restrictions later on. Opt for sellers who provide clear information about the account&amp;#39;s origin and history.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider using secure payment methods that offer buyer protection. Avoid sharing personal information unnecessarily during transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After acquiring your accounts, take immediate steps to enhance security. Change passwords promptly and enable two-factor authentication if possible. This adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with Telegram’s policies regarding multiple accounts as well; this knowledge will guide your strategy moving forward without risking your business’ online presence.
        Tips for Managing Multiple Telegram Accounts Effectively
        Managing multiple Telegram accounts can be a challenge, but with the right strategies, it becomes more manageable. Start by organizing your accounts based on specific purposes. This helps you keep track of different audiences and content types.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use dedicated devices or profiles to separate accounts if possible. This reduces confusion and allows for smoother navigation between each account. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leverage scheduling tools to plan your messages in advance. It saves time and ensures consistent engagement across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regularly review analytics from each account. Understanding what works best for each audience will help refine your approach over time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stay engaged with followers on all accounts, responding promptly to maintain a strong community feel. Use unique branding elements for each account so that they’re easily recognizable yet distinctively yours.
        Case Studies: Successful Businesses Utilizing Multiple Telegram Accounts
        Many businesses have harnessed the power of multiple Telegram accounts to streamline their marketing strategies. For instance, a popular e-commerce brand created separate accounts for various product lines. This allowed targeted messaging and promotions tailored to distinct customer segments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another tech startup used different accounts to engage with developers, users, and potential investors. Each account served specific content that resonated with its audience, fostering stronger relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A local restaurant chain leveraged multiple Telegram channels for promotional campaigns and community engagement. They shared exclusive offers through one account while using another for feedback and interaction with loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These examples illustrate how diverse approaches can maximize reach and enhance user experience on Telegram. The flexibility offered by having numerous accounts empowers brands to cater effectively to varying interests within their target market.
        Conclusion: Why Investing in Multiple Telegram Accounts is Worth It
        Investing in multiple Telegram accounts can significantly enhance your marketing strategy. Each account serves a unique purpose, allowing you to target different audiences or promote various products seamlessly. This approach not only diversifies your communication channels but also increases visibility and engagement with potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Businesses that understand the value of tailored content for distinct groups often see improved results. With Telegram&amp;#39;s growing popularity and its features designed for community building, having multiple accounts enables more effective interaction with users.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moreover, purchasing these accounts can save time and facilitate quicker growth in reach and influence. By leveraging the strengths of each account wisely, businesses can cultivate distinct brand identities while maintaining coherence across their communications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Investing in several Telegram accounts is not just a trend; it’s a strategic move that offers substantial long-term benefits for any business aiming to thrive in today&amp;#39;s competitive landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

        print(&amp;#39;&amp;#39;.join(reversed(LCS)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;✏️-새로운-내용&quot;&gt;✏️ 새로운 내용&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;📚-회고&quot;&gt;📚 회고&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;💡 &lt;strong&gt;#9251의 연장선&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;LCS를 처음부터 찾으면서 길이까지 파악하려고 하니, 너무 꼬이는 것 같았다.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;기존의 코드를 바탕으로 LCS를 빠르게 다시 역으로 찾는 것이 훨씬 효율적이었다.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;h1 id=&quot;rat--remote--administration-tool-&quot;&gt;RAT ( Remote  Administration Tool )&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;원래는 시스템 관리자가 멀리 떨어진 PC를 관리하기 위해 사용하는 원격 제어 도구이다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;하지만 해커가 사용자 몰래 설치하여 시스템 권한을 탈취하고, 원격에서 마음대로 조종하는 원격 제어형 트로이 목마를 의미하기도 한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;공격자는 RAT를 통해 마치 해당 PC 앞에 앉아 있는 것과 같은 똑같은 권한을 준다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;화면 모니터링 : 실시간으로 사용자 화면 보기 ( VNC ) 및 스크린샷 캡쳐&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;파일 관리 : 파일 업로드/다운로드, 삭제, 실행&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;키로깅 ( Keylogging ) : 사용자가 입력하는 모든 키보드값 ( 비밀번호도 ) 가로채기&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;장치 제어 : 웹캠 켜기, 마이크 녹음, 시스템 강제 종료/재부팅&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;명령 실행 : CMD나 파워쉘을 통해 추가 악성코드 살행&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;rat의-작동-원리--reverse-connection&quot;&gt;RAT의 작동 원리 : Reverse Connection&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;보안 장비 ( 방화벽 )을 뚫기 위해 RAT는 아주 영리한 방법을 사용한다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;일반적인 연결 ( Bind Shell ) : 공격자가 피해자 PC에 접속을 시도 → 방화벽에 차단 됨&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;리버스 커넥션 : 피해자 PC ( 악성코드 )가 공격자의 서버로 먼저 접속을 시도함&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;방화벽은 보통 안에서 밖으로 나가는 연결은 허용하는 경우가 많기 때문에 이 방식을 주로 사용한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;분석가가-rat를-찾아내는-법&quot;&gt;분석가가 RAT를 찾아내는 법&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;listdlls 활용&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;→ RAT은 정상 프로세스에 DLL 형태로 숨어 있는 경우가 많다. listdlls로 서명되지 않은 수상한 DLL이 로드되어 있는지 확인한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process Explorer 활용&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;→ 프로새스의 부모 - 자식 관계를 본다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;word.exe가 cmd.exe를 실행하고 있다면 아주 수상한RAT 징후&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;네트워크 상태 확인 ( netstat )&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;→ 내 컴퓨터가 알 수 없는 외부 IP와 지속적으로 연결되어 있는 확인한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;대표적인 RAT 종류&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;상용 / 관리용 : TeamViewer, AnyDesk ( 공격자들이 많이 악용 )&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;악성 : GhOst RAT, Quasar RAT, NjRAT&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;rat은-왜-단순-악성코드보다-더-위험한가&quot;&gt;RAT은 왜 단순 악성코드보다 더 위험한가?&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;컴퓨터를 껐다가 켜도 자동으로 다시 실행되도록 레지스트리에 숨어든다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;루트킷?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;리버스 커넥션 → 밖에서 안으로 들어오는 건 막아도, 안에서 밖으로 나가는 건 보안 장비들이 잘 못 잡다는 것을 악용하기 때문이다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;C&amp;amp;C 서버 : 공격자의 명령을 전달받는 본부 ( Command &amp;amp; Control ) 와 계속 통신할 수 있다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;루트킷과-닮은-점--지속성-끈질김--persistence-&quot;&gt;루트킷과 닮은 점 : 지속성, 끈질김 ( Persistence )&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;둘 다 시스템이 재부팅되어도 다시 살아나야 하기 때문에 윈도우가 켜질 때 자동으로 실행되는 Run 레지스트리 키에 자기 경로를 등록하거나, 정상적인 시스템 서비스인 척 위장에서 등록한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;루트킷은 주로 자기 자신을 숨기는 것에 특화되어 있다면, RAT은 원격 제어라는 목적을 위해 루트킷의 은폐 기술을 빌려 쓰는 느낌이다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;리버스-쉘과-닮은-점--방화벽-우회&quot;&gt;리버스 쉘과 닮은 점 : 방화벽 우회&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;리버스 쉘의 메커니즘은 RAT의 심장과도 같다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;일반적인 접속은 방화벽이 막지만, 피해자 컴퓨터가 공격자에게 먼저 말을 거는 방식은 대부분 보안 설정상 통과를 한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RAT는 리버스 쉘 방식을 기본으로 탑재하고, 그 위에 마우스 제어, 화면 캡쳐 같은 기능을 얹은 GUI 버전 리버스 쉘이라고 볼 수 있다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Systernals : 레지스트리를 건드려 자동 실행되는 것들을 잡는 도구이다. 여기서 루트킷이나 RAT이 숨어든 경로를 찾을 수 있다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;netstat -an ( CMD ) : 내 컴퓨터에서 공격자 IP로 연결된 리버스 쉘 형태의 통신이 있는지 확인한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Process Explorer : 어떤 정상 프로세스가 갑자기 네트워크 통신을 하고 있다면. 그 안에 RAT이 DLL 형태로 숨어 있을 확률이 높다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;결론적으로 RAT는 루트킷의 은폐형 + 리버스 쉘 + 상용 원격 도구의 편의성을 모두 합쳐 놓은 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h1 id=&quot;xss--corss-site-script-&quot;&gt;XSS ( Corss-Site-Script )&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RAT이 PC를 직접 조종하는 리모컨과 같은 느낌이라면, XSS는 사용자의 웹 브라우저를 납치하는 것이라고 볼 수 있다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;XSS는 공격자가 보낸 악성 스크립트 ( 보통 자바 스크립트 )가 사용자의 브라우저에서 실행되게 만드는 공격이다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;원래 브라우저는 내가 접속한 사이트에서 주는 코드만 실행하는 것이 원칙인데 XSS는 이 보안 원칙을 교묘하게 속인다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;3가지 주요 유형 &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Stored XSS ( 저장형 )&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;게시판이나 프로필 설정처럼 서버의 DB에 악성 스크립트를 아예 저장해버린다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;해당 게시물을 읽는 모든 사용자의 브라우저에서 스크립트가 실행된다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Reflected XSS ( 반사형 )&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;URL 파라미터에 스크립트를 넣어서 링크를 보낸다. 그 후 링크를 클릭 한 특정 사용자에게만 스크립트가 반사되어 실행된다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;DOM-Based XSS &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;서버로 데이터가 가지 않고, 브라우저 안에서 자바스크립트가 데이터를 처리하는 과정에서 발생한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;해커는-xss로-무엇을-하나&quot;&gt;해커는 XSS로 무엇을 하나?&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;쿠키 탈취 (Session Hijacking)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;document.cookie를 읽어서 로그인 세션을 훔친다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;악성 사이트 리다이렉션&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;사용자를 몰래 가짜 로그인 페이지로 보낸다&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;비밀번호 변경 및 개인정보 탈취&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;브라우저 몰래 가짜 로그인 페이지로 보낸다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAT 설치 유도&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;브라우저 취약점을 이용해 PC에 RAT 같은 악성코드를 다운로드하게 만든다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;대응 방안&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;입력값 검증 ( Input Validation )&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;같은 위험한 문자가 들어오지 못하게 막음&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;출력값 치환 &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;를 %lt;로 바꿔서 브라우저가 코드로 인식하지 못 하게 함&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CSP ( Content Security Policy )&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;브라우저에게 지정한 곳 외의 스크립트는 실행하지 않게 명령하기&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;script와---lt의-정체&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;와 &amp;lt; , %lt;의 정체&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt; : 브라우저에게 내리는 명령&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이것은 HTML 태그이다. 웹 브라우저는 웹사이트를 읽다가 &lt;script&gt;를 만나면 이렇게 생각한다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;브라우저 : 여기서부터는 화면에 보여주는 글자가 아니라 내가 실행해야 할 자바 스크립트 명령어라는 것을 알게 됨&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;공격자 활용 : 여기에 document.cookie를 탈취하는 코드를 짜넣으면, 사용자의 세션 정보가 해커에게 전송 됨&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;%lt; : 특수 문자 치환&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이것은 HTML에서 &amp;lt; 기호를 안전하게 표기하기 위한 약속된 코드이다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;%lt;는 브라우저에게 이건 태그를 시작하는 괄호가 아니라 그냥 화면에 보여줄 ‘작다’라는 기호일 뿐이라는 것을 알려줌&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;XSS 공격과 방어에는 여러 언어가 얽혀 있다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://velog.velcdn.com/images/rkdmf4916/post/850d0877-6064-4bd0-8f87-682705e2358a/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h4 id=&quot;지금부터--를-표시함으로-데이터와-명령어를-구분하였습니다&quot;&gt;지금부터 &apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;를 표시함으로 데이터와 명령어를 구분하였습니다.&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://velog.velcdn.com/images/rkdmf4916/post/6035b8e0-e81c-4d48-b2d1-15bfd373e314/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;sqli와-xss-데이터인가-명령인가의-싸움&quot;&gt;SQLi와 XSS 데이터인가 명령인가의 싸움&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1=1과 &lt;&apos;&apos;&apos;script&apos;&gt; 공격은 원리가 같다.  &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SQLi ( 1=1 ) : 원래는 아이디라는 데이터를 넣어야 하는 자리에, SQL 명령어의 일부인 “ OR 1=1 - - 을 넣음. 그러면 DB엔진은 이게 데이터가 아니라 조건문이구나라는 착각을 해서 로그인을 시켜줌&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;  XSS ( &lt;’’’script’&gt; ) : 원래는 댓글이라는 데이터를 넣어야 하는 자리에 브라우저가 실행할 명령어( 스크립트 )를 넣음. 브라우저는 이건 글자가 아니라 내가 실행해야 할 코드라고 생각하여 쿠키를 탈취하게 됨&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;결론적으로 둘 다 데이터여야 할 입력값이 시스템에 의해 명령어로 실행되는 허점을 노린 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;lt-는-왜-만들어졌고-왜-허점이-없을까&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;%lt; 는 왜 만들어졌고, 왜 허점이 없을까?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;원래 &lt; 기호는 HTML에서 태그를 여는 특수기호이다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;만약 게시판에 1&lt;2 입니다 라고 쓰고 싶은데 그냥 &lt;를 써버리면 브라우저는 이걸 태그의 시작으로 착각하고 뒤 내용을 안 보여주거나 에러를 낸다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;그래서 진짜 literally ‘작다’라는 수학 기호를 표시하고 싶을 때 쓰려고 만든 게 &lt;strong&gt;%lt;  ( less than )이다.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;%lt; 는 브라우저 엔진이 처리하는 최종 렌더링 단계의 약속이다.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;브라우저는 &amp;로 시작해서 ;로 끝나는 문자 ( Entity )를 보면 “아하 이건 코드로 읽지말고 무조건 그림 ( 문자 )로만 그려야 하네”라고 프로그래밍이 되어 있다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;해커는 바로 이 점을 역이용한다. 서버가 &lt;를 &lt;strong&gt;%lt; 로 바꾸지 않고 그대로 내보내면, 브라우저는 그걸 명령어로 읽어버리기 때문이다.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;요약하자면-해킹은-시스템이-데이터와-명령어를-구분하지-못할-때-발생한다&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;요약하자면 해킹은 시스템이 데이터와 명령어를 구분하지 못할 때 발생한다.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;공격 : 사용자가 입력한 데이터 안에 특수 기호를 섞어 넣어 시스템을 헷갈리게 함.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;방어 : 시스템이 사용자 입력을 받자마자 특수 기호들을 이건 단순한 글자라고 강제로 라벨을 붙여버리는 과정 ( 치환 / Escaping )&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;이 과정이 &lt;strong&gt;시큐어 코딩( Secure Coding )&lt;/strong&gt;이라고 한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;애초에 코드를 짤 때부터 해킹당하지 않게 짜는 법을 배우자.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;→ 소프트웨어를 개발하는 단계에서 발생할 수 있는 보안 취약점들을 미리 예측하고 이를 사전에 차단하도록 코드를 작성하는 기법을 말한다. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;소 잃고 외양간을 고치는 것이 아니라 외양간의 설계를 완벽하게 하는 것&lt;/p&gt;

Do you miss your lover and want him /her to come back to you? Do you want your ex to be in a relationship with you again? If you miss your partner/soulmate and cannot think of living this life without them, then performing this fast spell will help you make your lover come back to you. Imagine a love spell that could bring back your Ex, return a lost lover, or fix a broken relationship. The love spells were created to restore the romance and strength of deep love while erasing the heartache and pain of the past. By restoring these emotions with a clean foundation, my witchcraft rituals offer hope to those who fear resentment and deep anger from a lost partner—specialising in lost Love Spells, Marriage Spells, Protection Spells, Spiritual Healing, and Fortune telling. Many people still question whether love spells are effective or not, whether they are permanent or not. This can be based on past experiences where they tried some spell casters but were not fully satisfied with their results, or the love spells worked for only a short period and sometimes even yielded no results. To avoid such situations, you have to be careful with spell casters you approach; some are limited to certain Spiritual powers to cast.

        &lt;h3 id=&quot;문제&quot;&gt;문제&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;알고리즘에 대해서 정확히 모르는 부분이 많았다. 
        학교에서만 배운 알고리즘이라서 기억이 잘 나질 않았다.
        특히 스택과 큐의 동작 방식, 그리고 큐의 구조가 헷갈렸다.
        개념은 아는 것 같은데 막상 코드로 구현하려고 하니 
        front, rear, top의 움직임이 정확히 떠오르지 않았다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;시도&quot;&gt;시도&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;강의 때 주신 코드를 통해서 스택의 메소드들이 어떤 역할을 하는지,
        원형 큐를 실제로 어떻게 구현하는지 보았다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;해결&quot;&gt;해결&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;스택은 top을 기준으로 데이터가 쌓이고 제거된다는 점을 다시 이해했고,
        큐는 front와 rear가 서로 다른 역할을 하며 데이터를 관리한다는 것을 구분하게 되었다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;알게된-점&quot;&gt;알게된 점&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1.pop은 단순히 top 위치의 데이터를 읽는 것이 아니라, 
        top을 감소시키며 데이터를 제거하는 동작이다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2.원형 큐는 front를 항상 한 칸 비워두어야 
        공백 상태와 포화 상태를 구분할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;3.스택은 LIFO(Last In First Out) 구조이며, 
        실제로는 접시를 쌓는 그림을 떠올리면 이해가 쉽다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;4.선형 큐는 FIFO(First In First Out) 구조이며, 
        식당 줄을 서는 상황을 떠올리면 이해하기 쉽다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;5.자료구조는 정의를 외우는 것이 아니라, 포인터의 이동 흐름을 이해하는 것이 핵심이다.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;모아둔 일지 파일들을 다시 봐야할 일이 생겨 구글 &lt;strong&gt;NotebookLM&lt;/strong&gt;으로 정리해 보려고했는데 NotebookLM 파일 업로드 제한이 300개 ... 
        파일 하나하나 용량은 작은데 몇년 치다 보니 이걸 언제 다 손으로 복붙해서 합치고 있겠습니까? &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;대충 파이썬으로 밀어야겠다 하고 데스크탑을 켰는데, 이런저런 이유로 포맷 + 윈도우 계정분리를 해놓은 상황이라 파이썬환경이 구성되어있지 않은 상황
        무거운 아나콘다는 패스하고, &lt;strong&gt;Miniconda&lt;/strong&gt; 로 빠르게 끝내기&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;1-윈도우-파이썬-환경-세팅-miniconda&quot;&gt;1. 윈도우 파이썬 환경 세팅 (Miniconda)&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;복잡하게 갈 것 없이 Miniconda 설치하고, 터미널에서 바로 &lt;code&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt; 명령어 쓰기 위해 환경 변수(Path) 세팅.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\(경로)\miniconda3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\(경로)\miniconda3\Scripts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\(경로)\miniconda3\Library\bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;VS Code에서 Python 확장팩 깔고 가상환경 잡아준 뒤 라이브러리는 &lt;code&gt;python-docx&lt;/code&gt;랑 &lt;code&gt;docxcompose&lt;/code&gt; 두 개면 됩니다. (&lt;code&gt;pip install python-docx docxcompose&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;2-처음-겪은-위기-콘텐츠를-복구하시겠습니까-😇&quot;&gt;2. 처음 겪은 위기: &amp;quot;콘텐츠를 복구하시겠습니까?&amp;quot; 😇&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;처음엔 대충 &lt;code&gt;python-docx&lt;/code&gt;로 &lt;code&gt;element.body.append()&lt;/code&gt; 써서 합쳤는데 파일 내용은 합쳐졌지만 워드 열 때마다 복구 에러가 발생. 문서끼리 XML구조가 충돌해서 꼬여버렸다고 하여 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;docxcompose&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 라이브러리로 선회&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;3-3년-치-일지-합치기-스크립트-🚀&quot;&gt;3. 3년 치 일지 합치기 스크립트 🚀&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;요구사항은 심플합니다.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;종합 &amp;gt; 2022 &amp;gt; 202203폴더 &amp;gt; 일지.docx&lt;/code&gt; 이런 구조를 재귀적으로 싹 다 탐색.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;월(Month)이 바뀔 때마다 &lt;strong&gt;페이지 나누기(Page Break)&lt;/strong&gt; 추가해서 보기 좋게 분리.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;인자로 연도 폴더만 던져주면 해당 연도 파일이 딱! 나오게.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;import os

        files = [f for f in files if os.path.abspath(f) != os.path.abspath(output_filename)]

        sub_doc = Document(file)
        
        # 3. 폴더가 바뀌었을 때 처리
        if current_folder != last_folder:
        # 콘텐츠가 있는 경우에만 페이지 나누기 (composer 내부에서 처리 가능)
        master.add_page_break()
        print(f&amp;quot;  [Page Break] 새로운 폴더 진입: {os.path.basename(current_folder)}&amp;quot;)
        
        print(f&amp;quot;Merging: {os.path.basename(file)}&amp;quot;)
        
        # 4. XML 구조 깨짐 없이 안전하게 병합
        composer.append(sub_doc)
        last_folder = current_folder
        
        # 5. 최종 저장
        composer.save(output_filename)
        print(f&amp;quot;\n✨ 통합 완료! 저장 경로: {output_filename}&amp;quot;)
        
        # 실행부
        if __name__ == &amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;:
        # 인자가 없을 경우 가이드 출력
        if len(sys.argv) &amp;lt; 2:
        print(&amp;quot;Usage: python script.py [input_folder_path]&amp;quot;)
        print(&amp;quot;Example: python script.py ./docs/2022&amp;quot;)
        else:
        target_path = sys.argv[1]
        merge_docx_files(target_path)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;터미널 여러개 켜서 년도별폴더로 실행하고 병합된 파일 NotebookLM에 올리면 끝 &lt;/p&gt;
