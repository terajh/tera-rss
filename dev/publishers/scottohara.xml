      <content:encoded>I wrote much of this back in 2023 and 2024 while popover was still being implemented / was newly released. Since I began digitally scribbling my thoughts down, others ended up writing about the attribute - which was one of the reasons I didn’t feel any urgency in publishing my own post.

      <content:encoded>The topic of how to make an accessible spoiler component, or ‘should there be a spoiler element?’ has recently (re)-caught my attention. (I wrote most of this back in February and then forgot about it… as I seem to do these days. But then people necro’d a GitHub issue on the topic, so here we go again)</content:encoded>
