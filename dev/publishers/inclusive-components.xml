        &lt;p&gt;Some of the components I&apos;ve explored here have specific standardized requirements in order to work as expected. Tab interfaces, for example, have a prescribed structure and a set of interaction behaviors as mandated by the WAI-ARIA specification. &lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It&apos;s at your discretion how closely you follow these requirements. Research may show&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first thing I was told when I embarked on learning web standards about twelve years ago was, &quot;don&apos;t use tables for layout.&quot; This was sound advice in spirit, but not very well qualified. As a result, there have been some unfortunate interpretations. Using table markup inevitably results in a&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The key difference between a website and a web app is&amp;hellip; highly contested. On the whole, I&apos;d say the more links there are, the more site-like, and the more buttons, the more app-like. If it includes a page with a form, it&apos;s probably a kind of site. If it&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carousels (or &apos;content sliders&apos;) are like men. They are not &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; all bad — some are even helpful and considerate. But I don&apos;t trust anyone unwilling to acknowledge a glaring pattern of awfulness. Also like men, I appreciate that many of you would rather just avoid dealing with carousels, but often&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Collapsible Sections</title>

      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;Collapsible sections are perhaps the most rudimentary of interactive design patterns on the web. All they do is let you toggle the visibility of content by clicking that content&apos;s label. Big whoop.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Although the interaction is simple, it&apos;s an interaction that &lt;a href=&quot;http://caniuse.com/#feat=details&quot;&gt;does not have a consistent native implementation across browsers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, most of your basic interactions are showing or hiding something &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt;. I&apos;ve already covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/&quot;&gt;popup menu buttons&lt;/a&gt; and the simpler and less assuming &lt;a href=&quot;https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/&quot;&gt;tooltips and toggletips&lt;/a&gt;. You can add simple disclosure widgets, compound &quot;accordions&quot;, and their sister component the &lt;strong&gt;tabbed interface&lt;/strong&gt; to that list. It&apos;s&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My mantra for building web interfaces is, &quot;if it can&apos;t be done efficiently, don&apos;t do it at all.&quot; In fact, I&apos;ve preached about &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/190834530&quot;&gt;writing less damned code&lt;/a&gt; around the UK, Europe, and China. If a feature can only be achieved by taking a significant performance hit, the net effect is&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tooltips — affectionately misnomered as &quot;tootlips&quot; by my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevefaulkner&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; — are a precariously longstanding interface pattern. Literally &quot;tips for tools&quot;, they are little bubbles of information that clarify the purpose of otherwise ambiguous controls/tools. A common example is a control that is only represented by a cryptic icon, the meaning&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Classification is hard. Take crabs, for example. Hermit crabs, porcelain crabs, and horseshoe crabs are not — taxonomically speaking — &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; crabs. But that doesn&amp;#8217;t stop us using the &amp;#8220;crab&amp;#8221; suffix. It gets more confusing when, over time and thanks to a process called &lt;em&gt;carcinisation&lt;/em&gt;, untrue crabs evolve&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Todo List</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to tradition, each new javascript framework is put through its paces in the implementation of a simple todo list app: an app for creating and deleting todo list entries. The first Angular.js example I ever read was a todo list. Adding and removing items from todo lists demonstrates&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        &lt;p&gt;Some things are either on or off and, when those things aren&amp;#8217;t on  
        (or off), they are invariably off (or on). The concept is so rudimentary
        that I&amp;#8217;ve only complicated it by trying to explain it, yet on/off 
        switches (or toggle buttons) are not all&lt;/p&gt;
