      <content:encoded>Adam Argyle is clear with some 2025 CSS advice: I think every front-end developer should know how to enable&amp;#160;page transitions, transition a&amp;#160;&amp;#60;dialog&amp;#62;,&amp;#160;popover, and&amp;#160;&amp;#60;details&amp;#62;, animate light n&amp;#8217; dark&amp;#160;gradient text,&amp;#160;type safe their CSS&amp;#160;system, and&amp;#160;add springy easing&amp;#160;to animation.

It was a very real-world client need, and I do tend to prefer reading about technical solutions to real problems over theoretical ones.

      <content:encoded>CSS has a feature called Custom Properties. You know this. People also — somewhat interchangeably — refer to these as CSS variables. Somehow, that doesn&amp;#8217;t bother me, even though I tend to be a stickler about naming things. For instance, there is no such thing as a frontend developer. There are front-end developers who focus [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>While I don&amp;#8217;t think you should publish to Medium (at least not as the only place you publish something, you should write on your own site that you control), I get why other people do. You quickly sign up, write some words, hit publish, and the result is a pretty clean-looking presentation of your writing. [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>One of the reasons I can&amp;#8217;t stop thinking about native Web Components is how you can use them anywhere. &amp;#8220;Incremental adoption&amp;#8221; is the fancy phrase, I suppose. We&amp;#8217;ve even started using them on the new editor for CodePen we&amp;#8217;re still hard at work on to solve some interesting issues I&amp;#8217;m sure we&amp;#8217;ll talk about someday.

      <content:encoded>Listen I ain&amp;#8217;t trying to scare you, but this CSS stuff can get complicated. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be. CSS is just selectors with key value pairs in the end. The vast majority of CSS I write is pretty darn straightforward, especially once you have a general system (what files go where? how do we [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Julia Evans has released what she&amp;#8217;s saying is one of her most popular zines to date: How Git Works. I don&amp;#8217;t think you&amp;#8217;d regret reading it. I imagine most of us get by with knowing just enough Git to do our jobs, but are probably using 5% of what it can really do. Being very [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Dan Mall has my favorite post on picking a typeface. I&amp;#8217;m no master typographer, but I know enough that I don&amp;#8217;t want to be talked to like an absolute beginner where you teach me what a serif is. Dan gets into more realistic decision making steps, like intentionally not picking something ultra popular, admitting that [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I&amp;#8217;ve done a decent amount of accessibility work in the past few months, largely thanks to a nice fellow who uses JAWS and seems to enjoy our sessions together testing various bits of CodePen, old and new. I use classic tools like the axe and the WebAIM tools to find issues, and still, testing over [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>It continues to be a big year for Web Components. I&amp;#8217;m noticing it more this week as it&amp;#8217;s effecting some of my friends. My long-time ShopTalk co-host Dave Rupert just got a job at Microsoft working on Fluent UI Web Components. Probably didn&amp;#8217;t hurt that he wrote the book on them. I&amp;#8217;m stoked that big, [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Late last year Google made this showcase microsite The Web Can Do What!?. It&amp;#8217;s nicely done! I like how it talks about various somewhat-recently unlocked use cases, while itself being a showcase for other rather impressive things you can do on a website (cool usage of sticky sections, view transitions, etc). Google invests a lot [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>SVG Short Circuiting SVG is normally a pretty efficient file format. If an image is vector in nature, leaving it as vector is normally a good plan as it will like scale well and look pretty darn crips. But of course, It Depends. Super complex vector graphics can get huge, and a raster (i.e. JPG, [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Y&amp;#8217;all use Figma for design work? I&amp;#8217;d be willing to bet a lot of you do at your organization. I&amp;#8217;m still wrapping my brain around the fact that Adobe has to write a billion dollar check to not acquire it. It&amp;#8217;s no wonder why they wanted it — there is a new household name in [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
