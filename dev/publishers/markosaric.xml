      <content:encoded>Disclaimer 1: I&amp;#8217;m working on Plausible Analytics, a simple, lightweight, open-source and privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. Disclaimer 2: Cloudflare reached out in July saying they&amp;#8217;d &amp;#8220;love to chat&amp;#8221;. It all started with this tweet by Matthew Prince. We were upfront that we&amp;#8217;re not looking to sell or get funded and answered their questions about&amp;#8230; &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://markosaric.com/cloudflare-analytics-review/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Cloudflare Analytics review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>There&amp;#8217;s widespread use of adblockers on the web but users are increasingly blocking cookies and other tracking scripts too. Browsers such as Safari, Firefox and Brave are privacy-focused. Many users install additional plugins such as uBlock Origin to better protect themselves. Is Google Analytics still efficient considering the blocking rate? How big is the data&amp;#8230; &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://markosaric.com/google-analytics-blocking/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;13% of my website visitors block Google Analytics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Privacy regulations such as the GDPR say that you need to seek permission from your website visitors before tracking them. Most GDPR consent banner implementations are deliberately engineered to be difficult to use and are full of dark patterns that are illegal according to the law. I wanted to find out how many visitors would&amp;#8230; &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://markosaric.com/gdpr-consent/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Only 9% of visitors give GDPR consent to be tracked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I was happy to see some posts about blogging being widely discussed over the last few days. A couple of them that I wanted to highlight are &amp;#8220;If I could bring one thing back to the internet it would be blogs&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Blogging is not dead&amp;#8220;.

      <content:encoded>Yesterday there was a lively discussion on Hacker News and different Subreddits around cookie consent walls not being valid according to the GDPR. Ironically, when visiting the article discussed, I was faced with one of the worst and most user-hostile implementations of the cookie law. The web is broken. Behavioral tracking without consent, abuse of&amp;#8230; &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://markosaric.com/broken-web/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;How to fix the broken web as a site owner and web developer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>The internet is a tool that has democratized content publishing. It has made information free and enabled anyone to publish whatever they want, share their beliefs and gain a following. This is amazing if you use it for good. Facebook has lowered the bar to share ideas as low as it can get and now&amp;#8230; &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://markosaric.com/off-facebook/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;Please get your parents off Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Did you know that 94% of sites include at least one third-party resource while the median page requests content from 9 different domains? These third-party resources represent 35% of the total network activity and 7 of the 10 most used resources are owned by Google. Third-party resources slow down the web and are a concern&amp;#8230; &lt;a class=&quot;more-link&quot; href=&quot;https://markosaric.com/degoogleify/&quot;&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;How to de-Google your site to make it faster and visitor friendly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Firefox for Android just got much better. Mozilla did a complete rewrite and has created a new generation of Firefox (Preview) that&amp;#8217;s much more consistent with Firefox desktop experience.

      <content:encoded>There&amp;#8217;s a popular thread on Hacker News with lots of people complaining about how Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) is ruining their mobile web experience. Here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s wrong with using Google AMP.
