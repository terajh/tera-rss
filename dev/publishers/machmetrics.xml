In this article, we will particularly look at the average page load time in 2021 and importance of web vitals. We usually consider a site fast when its pages &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;On June 30th, 2021, our speed monitoring service will be retired. Speed tests will stop running, and all accounts will be closed. This was a difficult decision to make, but it&amp;#8217;s in the best interest of our users. MachMetrics started out as a passion project, and while I worked hard to deliver robust and reliable &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In September of 2020, big news was released &amp;#8211; Catchpoint would be acquiring WebPageTest. This is obviously very exciting news, but a little uncertainty comes with it. Webpagetest.org is one of the premier page speed auditing services in the industry. Many of you know that we at MachMetrics use WPT as our engine as well. &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you asked the average internet user how slow a website would need to load before they gave up and left, they might say something like 8 or 10 seconds. Unfortunately, visitors actually give up on websites much faster. After about the 2-second mark, your bounce rate starts to rapidly increase. So what is the &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;WebPageTest is one of the best website speed auditing services for any designer or developer concerned with site speed (which should be all of them). We use it as the engine for our automated testing services at MachMetrics.com. However, we often see WebPageTest utilized only in its simplest form, which is a little like driving &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We love hearing from customers who successfully increase their website&amp;#8217;s performance. Recently, we noticed one website see such a dramatic improvement that we had to ask for more details. The secret? He switched his site from a PHP site to a static site built with static website generator Jekyll. Jekyll is certainly not the only &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Target is one of the most well-known retailers around, and they&amp;#8217;ve recently increased their focus on the e-commerce portion of their business &amp;#8211; Target.com. In fact, they just cracked into the top 10 list of US e-commerce retailers. Unfortunately, Target.com is not a fast website. And this is shocking since we all know that page &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Responsive design is an absolute necessity in today&amp;#8217;s web. More users are visiting websites from their mobile devices than ever before, and if your website doesn&amp;#8217;t look good on when viewed from that device, they&amp;#8217;ll bounce. Unfortunately, many themes and frameworks achieve responsive design by using hidden images on mobile devices or tablets. Ok, so &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
