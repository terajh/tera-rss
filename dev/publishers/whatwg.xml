      <content:encoded>The WHATWG&apos;s living standards incorporate new features on an ongoing basis. The default process is to propose an idea on the relevant standard&apos;s issue tracker, hash out the details and gather implementer interest, and then work together with the editors to land a pull request. However, we&apos;ve found that for larger features, or for community [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <title>The URL Pattern Standard</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 05:30:02 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Welcome to the newest standard maintained by the WHATWG: the URL Pattern Standard! The URL Pattern Standard gives a generic pattern syntax for matching URLs, and extracting the parts from them. It is inspired by the path-to-regexp library, although it extends beyond paths to encompass all the parts of a URL. You can read more [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 16:07:01 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>In the last year or so, my main task was to tackle some of the &quot;specification technical debt&quot; that had been accumulating over a few years, specifically at the crossroads of Fetch, performance APIs, and the HTML Standard. Monkey patching and hand waving When starting this work, the behaviors of some of the features relating [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <title>New Living Standards</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 19:25:15 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>The last time we introduced a new Living Standard was Infra, in 2016. This year has seen a flurry of activity, with four new standards joining the WHATWG! The Web IDL Standard defines the interface language and JavaScript mapping for all web platform APIs. It migrated to the WHATWG from its old location, on the [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 15:05:15 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>In form submissions, form values containing newlines get normalized to CRLF. But that newline normalization runs deeper than might be thought. Here is a deep dive on the recent spec changes on that area.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 06:41:19 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>A couple things the Steering Group has been working on recently reached a new milestone and seemed noteworthy enough to highlight to the wider WHATWG community. As you may know the WHATWG formally collaborates with W3C on the DOM and HTML standards. In practice there is also a significant overlap in membership and sharing of [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <title>Considering accessibility</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2020 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Sometimes, new authors need a gentle reminder to think about accessibility when designing and writing web pages and apps. Experienced authors need a quick way to look up the allowed ARIA roles, states and properties for each HTML element. Browser and Assistive Technology (AT) implementers need quick access from an HTML element to its platform [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <title>Focusing on focus</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2019 08:09:26 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Focus behavior in HTML had been under-specified for the past few years, and it was also quite confusing due to a variety of subtle differences between focusing methods, UA-specific behaviors, relation to the tabindex attribute, relations to shadow DOM, etc. A few months ago Domenic filed a meta-bug that contains a list of things to [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <title>The state of fieldset interoperability</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 14:00:36 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>As part of my work at Bocoup, I recently started working with browser implementers to improve the state of fieldset, the 21 year old feature in HTML, that provides form accessibility benefits to assistive technologies like screen readers. It suffers from a number of interoperability bugs that make it difficult for web developers to use. [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>(If you’re interested in the IPR status of WHATWG standards this post is for you; otherwise, feel free to skip.) One aspect of last year&apos;s working mode changes is the periodic publication of a Review Draft for each WHATWG Living Standard, as per the IPR Policy. The WHATWG published an initial five of these just [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
