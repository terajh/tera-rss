      <title>#193 - Vue.js 3.1.0-beta Migration Build now available! Vue Devtools new beta supports Vue 2.x and more!</title>
      <link>https://news.vuejs.org/issues/193</link>

        Hi everyone,
        
        Great news! [Vue v3.1.0-beta](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) has been released with a set of new features and bug fixes, including the onServerPrefetch lifecycle hook!
        
        But that’s not all, because v3.1 comes with the thing we all have been looking forward to for months. The [Vue 2 to 3 Migration Build](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/tree/master/packages/vue-compat)! It allows you to run Vue 3 and the SFC compiler in a backward compatible mode so you can work through the deprecations/breaking-changes 1 by 1, instead of having to rewrite the whole app at once.
        
        If you are wondering how viable it is in a real-life, production application – I’ve tried it on a pretty large one (1k+ components) and managed to make it run and be partially functional within less than 2 hours. I’m convinced that I should be able to fully stabilize it within a few days. Wish me luck! 🤞
        
        Also, the new [beta for Vue-Devtools v6](https://headwayapp.co/vue-js-devtools-changelog/vue-2-support-plugin-permissions-193021) now supports Vue 2.x. No need to toggle different extension versions when switching projects.
        
        By the way, did you know that Vue was used in the mission during the Mars 2020 Helicopter mission? Well, now you do! And if you contributed, you should have a [fancy badge on GitHub](https://twitter.com/notphanan/status/1385624940003610624).
        
        Lastly, my favorite WYSIWYG editor – [tiptap](https://www.tiptap.dev/) – is now supporting Vue 3 with their new v2.0 beta release. Now rewritten in TypeScript.
        
        Have a great week,

      <title>#192 - Vue 3.0 to drop IE 11 support (RFC); 2 days until Vueconf.us; Component testing in Cypress;</title>

        Hi there!
        
        Last month might not have been the most eventful when it comes to Vue news, but there’s been plenty of exciting new libraries for Vue 3.0. Those include:
        
        - [🍍Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/) – a new Vuex alternative created by Eduardo San Martin Morote
        - [✋Vue-UseGesture](https://vue-use-gesture.netlify.app/) – a composable that helps you handle all kinds of mouse and touch events, including complex gestures by Mesut Koca
        - [🪄useMagicKeys](https://vueuse.org/core/usemagickeys/) – a composable that allows you to easily set keyboard shortcuts by Anthony Fu and the VueUse team
        - [📐Splitpanes](https://antoniandre.github.io/splitpanes/) – a library that makes dynamic splitpanes a breeze by Antoni &quot;antoniandre&quot;
        
        There’s also been one pretty impactful news –[ Vue 3.0 will likely drop support for IE 11](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/296). As dramatic as it sounds, Vue 3.0 was not supporting IE 11 at any time, but there was the plan to create a 3.0-compat build, that would support IE 11. Instead, the new idea (still in RFC) is to backport as many Vue 3.0 features (like the Composition-API) back into Vue 2.x. This should both ensure a smoother migration from Vue 2.x to 3.x, while also reducing the maintenance burden of supporting 2 builds of Vue 3.0. Additionally, this also removes the need to support IE 11 by all the 3rd party libraries.
        
        It also means that the Composition-API plugin for Vue 2.x will be obsolete, which is a good thing, because once the API becomes part of the core, the plugin-performance-tax will be removed. As an added benefit, Vue 2.x is being [migrated to TypeScript](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1379797086800113665) as we speak, which should improve the overall developer experience of those using TS.
        
        Lastly, [VueConf.us](https://vueconf.us/) is happening in on April 14th. It’s a completely free event and from what I’ve heard, there are some exciting announcements to look for! Don’t miss it – the tickets are available only until April 13th. ⏰
        
        Stay safe and enjoy the rest of the newsletter,

      <title>#191 - State of Vue 2021, Vite v2 released; Vuex 5 RFC; Vuetify for Vue 3 in alpha and more!</title>

      <content:encoded>
        Welcome back!
        
        Those last 3 weeks have been truly crazy! First of all, [Evan’s State of Vuenion 2021 talk at Vue.js Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El8Jw2CFj7g) where he is covering the recent developments in the Vue ecosystem. How Vue is doing (like [NASA using it to drive their mission control system](https://github.com/nasa/openmct)), new releases, and future plans! The recording ends with the announcement and highlights from [Monterail](https://www.monterail.com/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)’s annual State of Vue report, which you can download [here](https://www.monterail.com/state-of-vue-2021-report?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
        
        Vite – the frontend build tool everyone is crazy about [has hit v2](https://dev.to/yyx990803/announcing-vite-2-0-2f0a?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). It is a big milestone for the project as it is no longer limited to Vue only (though I would recommend using it for Vue projects starting now).
        
        Next – Vuex 5. Wait, what? Five? Hasn’t version 4 been released just recently? Yes, it was, but it was a mostly backward-compatible port of Vuex 3 dedicated to Vue 3.0. 
        
        Version 5 on the other hand is a completely new state management library. Although it still keeps some ideas from the Vuex you know (and the name), it presents a new approach to state management. Why? The Vuex team has learned a lot from the limitations and pain-points of the current implementation and decided it is time to move forward with new ideas. Make sure to read the [RFC](https://github.com/kiaking/rfcs/blob/vuex-5/active-rfcs/0000-vuex-5.md) and join the [discussion](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/270).
        
        That’s not all! Read the stories below for more news regarding i18n, Vuetify, Nuxt and the upcoming (free!) [VueConf.us](https://vueconf.us/) conference happening on April 14th!
        
        Kind regards,

        Hi everyone,
        
        Great news! [Vuex 4.0.0 (stable)](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/releases/tag/v4.0.0) for Vue 3.0 has been finally released! This is the version of Vuex that is 99% backward compatible with the old Vuex (v3) that you might be currently using in your Vue 2.x projects.
        
        There are already works on Vuex 5, which will come with a completely revamped API. Stay tuned!
        
        Heard of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)? If you’ve been subscribing to this newsletter, you probably have! It just recently reached v2 (currently in beta), which makes it a completely framework-agnostic frontend build tool that is incredibly fast and extendable thanks to the plugin system. Just recently it received a brand new logo and now has a dedicated Discord server. Want to talk to other early adopters – [join the server](https://discord.com/invite/aYVNktYeEB)!
        
        Events time! The [Vue Contributor Days](https://www.vuemeetup.com/#/vue-contributor-days-february-2021) are coming on February 25th followed by the [Vuejs Amsterdam](https://vuejs.amsterdam/) conference the day after (Feb 26-27th). Both events are free, so don’t miss out!
        
        I’d also want to thank my new sponsor – [Thomas Findlay](https://twitter.com/thomasfindlay94) who has just recently released an [advanced book on Vue](https://theroadtoenterprise.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=logo&amp;utm_campaign=vuejs-newsletter&amp;utm_content=valentine). You might want to check it out now as it is 35% off this week! 💚
        
        Cheers,

        P.S. Sorry for the delay this week. Bento went through a hip surgery last Friday (poor puppy) and required some additional attention through the weekend. He’s adjusting and is now [posing as Count Dracula](https://twitter.com/DamianDulisz/status/1359494679532863492) every time he wants food. Send treats.

        Hey there!
        
        Welcome, to the first issue of 2021!
        
        The Vue.js blog has been reactivated and can be found at [blog.vuejs.org](https://blog.vuejs.org/). There’s a new article posted – [Reflections for 2020-2021](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/hello-2021.html). In there, Evan You is sharing some of the thoughts and team-wide plans for 2021. Definitely give it a read!
        
        Vue-Storefront, a popular open-source project aimed at eCommerce has just [raised $1.5M in the seed round](https://www.vuestorefront.io/blog/vue-storefront-raises-1-5m-to-turn-the-fastest-growing-open-source-ecommerce-project-into-a-business). Congratulations to everyone involved! 🎉
        
        Also, Element UI – one of the most popular component libraries for Vue – now has a Vue 3.0 version called Element Plus. You can read the announcement [here](https://itnext.io/element-ui-for-vue-3-0-is-coming-53dfa6d4fe32). Check out the [docs](https://element-plus.org/#/en-US/component/installation) for the migration guide. And if you’d like to get started with it alongside Vite – there’s even an [element-plus-vite-starter](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus-vite-starter)!
        
        Speaking of Vue 3.0 libraries – have you heard of VueUse? The project, which started as a small collection of useful composables has grown by a lot! Just check out the [list of available functions](https://vueuse.js.org/functions.html). They also just recently created a GitHub organization to host several useful libraries and projects like [Vue-Demi](https://github.com/vueuse/vue-demi).
        
        Cheers,

        Hey everyone,
        
        hope you had a great time during the holiday season! 🌲 I know I had! 🥟 🐕
        
        Let’s start with some great news. [Guillaume Chau](https://twitter.com/Akryum) has published a new beta release of the [Vue.js Devtools v6](https://twitter.com/Akryum/status/1341886270012874756). It ships with multiple new features and enhancements. 
        
        Just yesterday, [Rahul Kadyan](https://twitter.com/znck0) has published a new VS Code extension called [VueDX](https://twitter.com/znck0/status/1343645532502290433)  to further improve the developer experience when working with Vue, including TypeScript dedicated features. This is a part of a bigger project called [Vue Developer Experience](https://github.com/znck/vue-developer-experience) (VueDX for short).
        
        Finally, 2020 is coming to an end. I wish you all an awesome 2021! 🥳

        Hey there,
        
        it’s been a while... Did you miss the newsletter? I hope you did actually! I’m sorry for the unexpected break. And trust me, getting myself to send this issue, was harder with every week that passed. 2020 has been pretty rough for all of us... I hope you’re all doing OK and let’s hope 2021 will be better.
        
        That’s why I’m happy to announce I’m now planning to continue sending out the newsletter on a bi-weekly basis! 🎉
        
        I would like to thank all my sponsors (especially [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) and [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/)!) for keeping up with me despite the newsletter-related inactivity. I’d also want to welcome a new sponsor – [Vue.js Amsterdam](https://vuejs.amsterdam/). Thank you all for your trust and support! 💚
        
        As for the news! Vue-Router just hit the [v4.0 stable release](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next/releases/tag/v4.0.0)! 🎉
        
        Additionally, as every year, [Monterail](https://www.monterail.com/) is working on the [State of Vue.js survey](https://eqxai-event.typeform.com/to/BuZO0b4U) and needs your contribution! The [State of JS](https://survey.stateofjs.com/survey/state-of-js/2020) survey is also open so let’s make sure the world knows about Vue.js and how awesome it is!
        
        Thanks for reading! So glad to be back!
        
        — [*Damian Dulisz*](https://twitter.com/DamianDulisz)

        This is a huge milestone for us that, to quote Evan You himself *„represents over 2 years of development efforts, featuring [30+ RFCs](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/tree/master/active-rfcs), 2,600+ commits, [628 pull requests](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+-author%3Aapp%2Fdependabot-preview+) from [99 contributors](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/graphs/contributors), plus tremendous amount of development and documentation work outside of the core repo”*. Along with it, of course, is the terrific work of the teams behind the new documentation and the surrounding ecosystem libraries like Vue-Router, Vuex, Vue-CLI, Vue-Devtools, Vue-Test-utils, Vetur and others!
        
        Here are the [release notes](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

        👋 Hi there,
        
        great news! We are now closer than ever to the official Vue 3.0 release. The first Release Candidate marks the RC stage of the project which will be followed by a stable stage. You can read the whole announcement [here](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/issues/189).
        
        Additionally the [Official Vue.js 3.0 Docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/) has been released (beta version)! Huge shout-out to the docs team: [@NataliaTepluhina](https://github.com/NataliaTepluhina), [@bencodezen](https://github.com/bencodezen), [@phanan](https://github.com/phanan) and [@sdras](https://github.com/sdras)! 🙌
        
        This is likely a good moment to start reading the [Migration Guide](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html#overview) so you can start planning the migration. Don’t worry, if your project is relatively small and you have been following the RFCs, and avoiding to-be-deprecated functionalities, this process should be pretty quick!
        
        Happy coding!

        Hi there,
        
        As we are all waiting for the new major version of Vue, you might be wondering – how much longer? We are happy to share the latest [status update](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/issues/183) of the project.
        
        __TL;DR; Release Candidate mid July. Official release in August.__
        
        In the meantime, while we are waiting for some of the tooling to catch up with Vue 3.0, Evan has created a [new proposal](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/182) for improving the DX of building Vue components. Inspired by Svelte! Check it out, it’s pretty magical! ✨
        
        There’s also a new Nuxt.js release – [v2.13.0](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/release-notes/#v2.13.0). It comes with a completely new build come called full-static. There’s also a new release of [create-nuxt-app](https://twitter.com/atinux/status/1275035452010094592?s=21)!
        
        Cheers,

      <title>#182 - Quasar.Conf coming online on July 5th; The process of rewriting Vue.js;</title>

        Hi there,
        
        I’m back with some interesting news for you!
        
        Are you interested in Quasar? If yes, there’s an online [Quasar.Conf](https://dev.to/quasar/introducing-quasar-conf-52gg) coming on July, 5th. You can still submit your lightning talks if you would like to present something related to either Vue or Quasar.
        
        If you happen to use the Composition-API plugin, make sure to be careful with the update to the [recently released v0.6.0](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api/releases/tag/v0.6.0). It slightly changes the behavior of watch to align better with the Vue 3.0 implementation.
        
        Speaking of Vue 3 – there’s a [great story](https://increment.com/frontend/making-vue-3/) written by Evan You about the design decision and process of rewriting the whole library. Make sure to check it out!
        
        Stay safe,

      <title>#181 - #181: 📓 Big News from Nuxt.js – Introducing the Content and Components modules 🎉</title>
      <link>https://news.vuejs.org/issues/181</link>
      <guid>https://news.vuejs.org/issues/181</guid>

        Hi there,
        
        we’ve just had some incredibly exciting 2 weeks in the Nuxt.js world! First the Nuxt team released the [__components module__](https://github.com/nuxt/components), which allows you to skip importing Vue components manually as they will be automatically located and imported for you when you use them. With support for lazy-loading!
        
        Just a few days later however, the team also released another module called [__content__](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). It allows you to use local files (Markdown, JSON, YAML etc.) as a Git-based CMS. You can be familiar with this approach if you used VuePress or Gridsome. Of course, you can use Vue components inside your Markdown files. Make sure to check the docs!
        
        Cheers,

      <title>#180 - 🏎 Say hi to Vite! A brand new, extremely fast development setup for Vue. So fast it feels instant!</title>
      <link>https://news.vuejs.org/issues/180</link>
      <guid>https://news.vuejs.org/issues/180</guid>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        Hey there,
        
        As you all know &quot;*Vue*&quot; in French stands for &quot;*View*&quot; and pretty much describes what Vue.js doing – handling the view part. This week, I’d like to introduce you to &quot;*[Vite](https://github.com/vuejs/vite)*&quot;, which means &quot;*Fast*&quot;. It’s a brand new development setup created by Evan You ([tweets for context](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1252173663199277058)). It ditches bundling in the development phase in favor of using native ES imports with on demand compilation of Vue single-file component files and more. Also acts as a local server and is capable of bundling production code using Rollup.
        
        What does it mean? The fact that it is crazy fast. Cold start clocks at around 140ms compared to Vue-CLI 1900ms. But now the best part – changes in code are reflected in the browser almost instantly, without a page reload. HMR that is actually reliable! 🎉
        
        Hold your horses though... Vite is currently still in the experimental phase. You can learn more about the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs/vite) and follow [Evan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) for more updates like this [one](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1258059968542097410).
        
        Ah, and there is already [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/)! Obviously it’s still a work-in-progress but you can play with it. Just like Vite, it ships with Vue 3.0-beta.
        
        Stay safe,

        Hello,
        
        long time no see... Sorry about that! Have you been missing the newsletter? I sure hope you did.
        
        I’ve got some exciting news for you! __Vue v3.0-beta has been released!__ This brings us yet another step closer to the final release. There’s also a [presentation from Evan You](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LHp-8hEtXEMSE1fd6YLAhYmtndQelQKbWlGggZKe4y8/edit#slide=id.g31e95ee831_0_92) that will walk you through the next steps.
        
        There’s also a small update to Vuex – __v3.2.0__. It comes with an utility hasModule function that allows you to check if a module is already registered.
        
        Also thanks to some recent work by [Rahul Kadyan](https://twitter.com/znck0/), we’re getting closer to a much improved TypeScript experience for Vue 3.0 which also includes templates! It might also support [smart refactoring](https://twitter.com/znck0/status/1251828990894997504) (check out the short video in the link)!

        Hello,
        
        Do you know this website called Wikipedia? Where you can read about things? Like an online encyclopedia of sorts, but everyone can contribute? 🙃 It’s maintained by the good people from Wikimedia as well as volunteers and a few days ago the decision has been made for [Wikimedia to adopt Vue](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241180)! Does it mean Wikipedia will now become a Vue SPA – 99,9% not! But it means some parts of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects might be using Vue to enhance some of the more complicated, interactive elements. Like the page editor for example. If you’ve been wondering why Vue is called the &quot;progressive framework&quot; this use-case explains it pretty well I think.
        
        As most conferences and meetups get canceled due to the pandemic, many organisers are embracing online events. You can watch the [#1 Vue.js Amsterdam Virtual Meetup here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?index=2&amp;list=PLCxzy-hmQq9Hj8j4zChXJpfBFhfVdUiKN&amp;t=0s&amp;v=6IM9gphOvXw). Additionally, a new initiative has been born, largely thanks to [Maria Lamardo](https://twitter.com/marialamardo) in the form of Vue Global Meetup that aims to help collaborate different Vue communities around the world to broadcast online meetups. The first of such will happen on the 14th of April. [Sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/vue-global-meetup-tickets-101090117262?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch) if you would like to participate!
        
        Speaking of events – there are several [new videos from Vue.js Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCxzy-hmQq9FnnpckFDeDtbpsUqxdheQn)! Vue Mastery has also started publishing [talks from the recent VueConf.us](https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-us-2020/).

        Hi there,
        
        it’s been a while since the last issue and I’m terribly sorry about that. The last few weeks have been really high on anxiety with all that’s been going on right now in the world. I hope you are all safe and healthy! 💚
        
        There are some good news though! First of all, lets congratulate [Kia King Ishii](https://twitter.com/KiaKing85/status/1237747709303345154) on joining the Vue.js core team! 🎉 He has been doing an incredible job building [vuex-orm](https://github.com/vuex-orm/vuex-orm) and will now focus on working on the next versions of Vuex.
        
        Speaking of which – [Vuex v4.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha.1) has just been released! This is the version of Vuex that will work with Vue 3.0 but keep the familiar API you know from the current version.
        
        Wait, there’s more – [Nuxt.js v2.12](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.12.0) is here! Among multiple changes it introduces a [new fetch hook](https://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-fetch) that allows you to fetch asynchronous data during SSR in any component that is being rendered (not just /pages components). 🔥 To sweeten it up, the Nuxt team also added support for [TypeScript in create-nuxt-app v2.15](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app/releases/tag/v2.15.0)!
        
        Finally something to keep you busy during the likely extended stay at home: Vue.js Amsterdam have released almost 30 talks from the recent conference. You can [watch the talks here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCxzy-hmQq9FnnpckFDeDtbpsUqxdheQn) with new ones added every other day.
        
        And tomorrow (March 19) – you can join an [online meetup](https://www.vuemeetup.com/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#/) with [Chris Fritz](http://twitter.com/chrisvfritz/) and [Rahul Kadyan](https://twitter.com/znck0/) organised by [This Dot: Media](https://twitter.com/thisdotmedia).
        
        Stay safe and see you next week!

        Hi there,
        
        I hope you had a great week!
        
        If you are using the Vue CLI UI, it is __recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible__ to the [new release (v4.2.0) of Vue-CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/releases/tag/v4.2.0). It comes with an important bug fix related to a recently discovered CORS issue.
        
        There’s a [new episode (#2) of Enjoy the Vue](https://enjoythevue.io/episodes/2/), this time about the Vue-CLI, where the hosts talk about their favorite parts of the tool and share some great tips on how to make the most of it!

        I’m very happy to let you know that [Ben Hong aka bencodezen](https://twitter.com/bencodezen) has recently joined the Vue.js core team!

        Congratulations Ben! 🐉
        
        Also, VuePress v1.3.0 has been released! You can check out the list of changes [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/releases/tag/v1.3.0).

      <content:encoded>
        Hello,
        
        let’s start with the good news first. The vue-test-utils project has now 4 new maintainers: [Jessica Sachs](https://twitter.com/_JessicaSachs), [Lachlan Miller](https://twitter.com/lachlan19900), [Dobromir Hristov](https://twitter.com/d_m_hristov) and [Adria Fontcuberta](https://twitter.com/afontq) and they just shipped their first release of the library. So glad to have you all on board! Welcome to the gang!
        
        As for the bad news – this is likely the first time I’m actually feeling sad to deliver the news since the inception of this newsletter. __That’s because the long time member of the Vue core team – [Chris Fritz](https://twitter.com/chrisvfritz) – had decided to leave the team.__ We’ve meet a few years back at the first VueConf and ever since then I considered him a mentor figure to me. One of the nicest and smartest people I ever had the pleasure to work with.
        
        If one of the reasons why you started using Vue were the amazing docs – this is largely due to him being the long time curator of the Vue documentation. But his work was more than just the docs. Chris has contributed to how the Vue core and the official supporting libraries look like right now. He has also helped establish good practices, the official style guide and (if you remember Vue 1.x) the migration helper. This and much more!
        
        This is a huge loss for the team, the Vue-ecosystem and the whole community in general. We will be missing you Chris! 💚 Good luck in whatever you plan on doing next!
        
        You can read the whole announcement [here](https://gist.github.com/chrisvfritz/52490a5d2e42876edcf7d7e5f94dee87). It’s also a good place to say the much deserved “thank you” for all the heart he has put into Vue.
        
        I wish you a great week,

      <title>#171 - Try out Vue 3.0-alpha now; GraphQL with Composition-API? Check out Vue-Apollo v4 and Villus and more!</title>
      <link>https://news.vuejs.org/issues/171</link>

      <content:encoded>
        Hello,
        
        I have some pretty great news for you! Have you already tried running Vue 3.0-alpha build? That wasn’t that easy up until recently. But now we have [vue-cli-plugin-vue-next](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli-plugin-vue-next)! 🔥
        
        This makes it as easy as adding a new plugin to your Vue-CLI based app. It takes care of configuring the webpack to use a new .vue files compiler. Certainly not something you should do on production, but if you would like to try things like Proxy-based reactivity or Suspense – this is probably the best way to do that.
        
        Working with GraphQL and Apollo will most likely got even better once Vue 3.0 is released. [Natalia Tepluhina](https://twitter.com/N_Tepluhina) has written a [great article](https://dev.to/n_tepluhina/vue-apollo-v4-the-first-look-c32) that shows how to migrate a Vue-Apollo v3 app to v4, which uses composition-API. But if you don’t need all of Apollo, you can also take a look at [Villus – a tiny GraphQL client](https://logaretm.com/blog/2020-01-11-announcing-villus/) created by [Abdelrahman Awad](https://twitter.com/logaretm?lang=en).
        
        Also, if you happen to struggle with unit tests in Vue, there is a chance you might find the needed answers in the [Vue Testing Handbook](https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/) by [Lachlan Miller](https://twitter.com/Lachlan19900)! Make sure to take a look!
        
        Enjoy!

        Hello,
        
        have you missed me? As you might have noticed (though I hope you did not and have had some relaxing, off-work holidays instead), I have been on a holiday break from the newsletter. But now I’m back!
        
        As for the news – there’s a new version of [Nuxt.js – v2.11.0](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.11.0). Also, the results from the State of JavaScript 2019 are [here](https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/). Once again Vue scores very high when it comes to developer satisfaction.
        
        Btw, did you know that our newsletter has now more than 20,000 subscribers?! Thank you a lot! 🚀
        
        Happy Vue Year! 🎉

      <title>#169 - First talk from VueConfTO published; posva/pinia: the Experimental state-management and more!</title>

        Hello Vuers,
        
        any plans for the weekend? Or still standing in line for holiday gifts? If its the latter, here you have something to read on while waiting.
        
        First of all, the first talk from VueConf Toronto has been published *[Design Principles of Vue 3.0](https://vuetoronto.com/videos/design-principles-of-vue-3-evan-you/)* by Evan You. Check it out!
        
        Speaking of Evan, he recently [wrote down an explanation](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader#how-it-works) of how the vue-loader works dedicated to people interested in getting involved in the project. But if you are just curious of how it works, you can still take a look.
        
        Also, [Eduardo With Many Names aka Posva](https://twitter.com/posva/) has released an [experimental state-management library](https://github.com/posva/pinia) for Vue 3.0 called Pinia. It shows how state management libraries could potentially be used with the Composition-API. It even integrates with the current Vue Dev Tools. It’s pretty ridiculous how little code you need with the Composition-APIs to build something like this.
        
        You can already try it out with the [official composition-api plugin](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) for Vue 2.x.
        
        Have an awesome weekend,

        Hi there,
        
        it never ceases to amaze me how much one person can do. And I’m not speaking about Evan here. Recently [Guillaume Chau](http://twitter.com/akryum) aka Akryum has been on a building spree. He just released the [vue-apollo v4.0-alpha](https://v4.apollo.vuejs.org/guide-composable/) which is built with Vue Composition API in mind. But that’s not all. He also added [server-side rendering support to the @vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api/pull/198) plugin. And then he refactored the [awesomejs.dev](https://awesomejs.dev/) website to use both of those libraries. You can see the changes in this [commit](https://github.com/Akryum/awesomejs.dev/commit/e59a65f6d318cfad9f340681e843d2de20d032fb). It might give you a good impression on how the Composition API might change the way you write components. Good job! 👏👏👏
        
        Of course, it is not required to use the Composition API at all in Vue 3.0, but it seems Guillaume is very excited about it! And so am I after trying it out for my libraries.

        Hello!
        
        Finally the conference season has ended for me (uff! 😅) and hopefully I can get back to sending the newsletter on the original schedule. Hope you don’t mind the recent delays.
        
        This year’s [State of JavaScript survey](https://survey.stateofjs.com/) is open right now – let’s make sure Vue is properly represented in the results!
        
        In the recent [podcast episode](http://www.fullstackradio.com/129) of Full Stack Radio, Adam Wathan has interviewed Evan You on all the things Vue 3.0. Such a great episode – you can’t miss it!
        
        Happy Thanksgiving weekend everyone! 🎉

        I’m happy to let you know that the speaker lists at the both [VueConf.US](http://vueconf.us/#speakers) and [Vue.js Amsterdam](https://vuejs.amsterdam/#speakers) have been announced! There are some new faces I’m very excited to see talking. The conference dates also happen to be around the end of Q1, so we should be very close to the planned Vue 3.0 release.
        
        Speaking of releases – the [eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/releases) has been updated to v6.0, which now supports Eslint v6.0. Great work to everyone that’s been involved!

        Hey there,
        
        I’m glad to let you know that I’m finally back to writing the newsletter after my travels and conference preparations. I’m sure you might have not missed me much, since [An](https://twitter.com/notphanan/) did an amazing job during my absence. He’s pretty amazing, don’t you agree?
        
        [VueConf Toronto](https://twitter.com/vuetoronto) has been amazing – definitely one of my favorite conferences ever! If you haven’t been there last week, make sure to get there next year. Great talks, cozy atmosphere and amazing people! Check out the Twitter [#VueToronto](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23VueToronto) hashtag to get a feeling how the event looked like. 
        
        All the slides are already available [here](https://vuetoronto.com/slides/).
        
        By the way – here’s [one of my favorite tweets](https://twitter.com/frontstuff_io/status/1194260549598662658) by Sarah Dayan that sums up and answer to one of the questions asked towards the core team during the Q&amp;A session. 
        
        Hope you have a great week!

        Hi everyone, it’s An here again. It’s been one of those more quiet weeks on the FE front (I know, I know), so we don’t have a lot to share this time. Still, there’s a couple of nice videos from ReactiveConf, interesting articles on Tailwind CSS and a news SSR framework, and a Twitter thread from Evan explaining how Vue 3 will be an incredible release. So, enjoy!
        
        P.S. I’m visiting the beautiful city of Prague this weekend so [let me know](https://twitter.com/notphanan) if anyone wants to hang out for a cup of ☕.

        Hey everyone, it&apos;s An here again freezing to death in this first wave of cold air from the Alps. From the core team, [Gillaume](https://twitter.com/akryum) is still on a roll, this time with a new version of [Vue Devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools), and  is currently busy in New York preparing for his VueToronto talk on Vue 3.0 APIs for library authors – he shared with me the talk&apos;s synopsis and let me tell you now: It will be solid!
        
        This week, aside from the Vue 3 articles that we certainly can&apos;t get enough of, we have some more general Vue techniques and practices to share. So, roll up your sleeves and get busy!

        Hello,
        
        [Guillaume](https://twitter.com/akryum) seems to have been very productive this week. Two new versions of his libraries have been released: [Vue-Apollo v3.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-apollo/releases/tag/v3.0.0) is here and has a new home – the library becomes part of the Vue core libraries, which means it’s now located under the vuejs org. Also, [vue-cli-plugin-ssr](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-cli-plugin-ssr/releases/tag/v0.6.0) is now version 0.6.0!
        
        As we are getting closer to the Vue 3.0 release, we have several more articles on Composition API – one of the biggest new additions to the framework.

        Hello Vuegazers,
        
        I’m very happy to let you know that Vue has just passed the [magical 150k stargazers](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/stargazers) on GitHub. Remember to put on your sunglasses when the new shiny Vue release ships. 😎
        
        Speaking of new releases – the Vue-CLI v4.0 stable is finally here! Read the [release notes here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/releases/tag/v4.0.0). There’s also a [migration guide from v3](https://cli.vuejs.org/migrating-from-v3/). Why would you migrate? The new release comes with updated versions of core-js, jest, workbox-webpack-plugin and many more, improving the support for PWAs and testing experience. It also comes with some additional functionalities for plugin authors as well as support for other package managers.
        
        [VuePress v1.2.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/releases/tag/v1.2.0) has also been released this week and comes with several new improvements. Most notably, you can now use async functions inside the vuepress config file.
        
        Do you know Vue Curated? It’s a platform to search for curated Vue packages, but it has been recently deprecated in favor of [awesomejs.dev](https://awesomejs.dev/for/vue/) also created by [Guillaume Chau](https://twitter.com/Akryum). Check it out, as it already includes several catalogs for packages dedicated to Vue, Nuxt, Vue-CLI, VuePress and Gridsome.
        
        Enjoy,

        Speaking of Vue 3.0 – there’s a [great repo](https://github.com/LinusBorg/composition-api-demos) by LinusBorg with several demos of how we will be able to use the Composition API. Make sure to check it out!

        For those who didn&apos;t manage to grab a ticket: No worries, more conferences and meetups are already planned. And, of course, at the end of the day we&apos;ll always have this newsletter!

        The [Quasar App CLI v1.1.0](https://medium.com/quasar-framework/quasar-app-cli-1-1-0-released-f63bf2274ea3) has been released. The most important change is probably the built in support for using Sass in your CSS code.

        Hello,
        
        When I first heard about the [Vue Community Guide](https://vue-community.org/) idea during the Vue.js Amsterdam conference I got really excited about it. A place where beginners could easily learn to navigate the vast Vue ecosystem, including the UI frameworks, available tooling and places where they can learn and receive help from other Vue developers. And now it’s finally done! You can read the [introduction post](https://dev.to/dobromirhristov/the-developer-s-guide-to-the-vue-ecosystem-4amb) here.
        
        Also, the [Vue-CLI v4.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc.0) has reached the release candidate stage and now comes with a [new docs](https://next.cli.vuejs.org/). Give it a try!
        
        VeeValidate v3.0 has been released! 🎉 It’s a complete re-write and comes with a lot improvements and quite a few breaking changes. Read the [announcement article](https://www.baianat.com/labs/code/veevalidate-3-0) to learn more about the changes.

        Hello,
        
        Here I got some amazing news for you!
        
        Remember the Function-based Component API proposal? After a long discussion and the feedback we collected from the community, it ended up rejected, but is now back, in a fully reworked form and is known as the Composition API. The new name suits it perfectly. You can read more about the proposed changes [here](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/78). No breaking changes, no need to rewrite anything. Keep in mind this is still an RFC, which means your feedback is more than welcome.
        
        There’s even a separate [VuePress page with docs on how the Composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/) would work, that I highly recommend you to read.
        
        Also, Nuxt.js has just [hit the 2.9.0 version](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.9.0) with several new features and bug fixes. Most notably TypeScript users get a set of 3 modules to hugely improve the developer experience. You can read more about it in the dedicated [docs for Nuxt TypeScript](https://typescript.nuxtjs.org/).
        
        That’s not all. If you’ve been looking for a static page generator to build your blog and for some reason you were not satisfied with either Gridsome or VuePress and building it from scratch with Nuxt seemed like a lot of work – don’t worry. [Jonas Galvez](https://twitter.com/anothergalvez) from the Nuxt.js team has just released [NuxtPress](https://nuxt.press/)! There’s even a [backstory](https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2019/aug/19/the-story-of-nuxtpress/) to it. Great work!
        
        Cheers!

        Hello,
        
        This has been a rather calm week when it comes to Vue-related news, but we still have some pretty neat tutorials for you to read.
        
        There’s also a new interview with [Debbie O’Brien](https://twitter.com/debs_obrien) on the latest [Views on Vue](https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue/vov-073-contributing-to-open-source-with-debbie-obrien/) podcast. She shares her story of how she started with programming and became a contributor to open-source projects like webpack. Super inspiring! 🌟 Must listen!

        Hello,
        
        amazing news – the [Vue-Router v3.1.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/releases/tag/v3.1.0) has been released by [Posva](https://twitter.com/posva/) and along with several fixes and improvements, the Router-Link component now has a scoped-slot! This allows for some really powerful customization options. [Here](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#v-slot-api-3-1-0) you can find the related docs.
        
        Still not sure what to think about the vue-function-api RFC? There’s another [great article](https://blog.bitsrc.io/vue-js-3-future-oriented-programming-54dee797988b) that shows how you will be able to use it to further simplify your application by extracting common features into composition functions.

      <content:encoded>
        Hello,
        
        here’s something many of you have been waiting for – [Vuetify v2.0 has been officially released](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/releases/tag/v2.0.0)! 🎉 Congrats on all the hard work to the Vuetify team! If you would like to say thanks too, make sure to check out their [sponsorship page](https://github.com/users/johnleider/sponsorship).
        
        There are two new podcast episodes that you might want to listen to. [Natalia Tepluhina talking](https://egghead.io/podcasts/how-vue-earns-its-beginner-friendly-reputation-with-natalia-tepluhina) about how Vue is earning it’s beginner-friendly reputation and [Chris Fritz explaining](https://devmode.fm/episodes/new-awesomeness-coming-in-vuejs-3-0) the incoming changes in Vue v3.0.
        
        There’s also [one article](https://michaelnthiessen.com/advanced-vue-controlling-parent-slots) written by [Michael Thiessen](https://twitter.com/MichaelThiessen) that you really don’t want to miss. It might seem a bit complicated at first but the end idea is actually very practical, often for completely different reason.
        
        I would also want to thank [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/vue?utm_source=vuejsnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=nativescript-awareness) for becoming the first [silver sponsor](https://github.com/users/shentao/sponsorship) of this newsletter!

        Hello,
        
        this week has been pretty calm in terms of news, but definitely not when it comes to interesting articles and tutorials. One of my fav authors – [Krutie Patel](https://twitter.com/KrutiePatel) is now blogging for Vue Mastery and has just published her new article on [building Typeform-like forms with Vue](https://medium.com/vue-mastery/building-an-interactive-and-distraction-free-form-with-vue-bfe23907e981). Great read!
        
        Although the Vue Function API is still under consideration as a part of the RFC process, it has already picked up in the community thanks to the [vue-function-api](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-function-api) library, which allows you to use it in your current Vue 2.x apps. There’s a [great article](https://xebia.com/blog/next-generation-async-functions-with-vue-async-function/) by Albert Brand on how to use it to fetch data with ease thanks to a utility library he wrote on top of the function API.
        
        Enjoy!

        have you been wondering how front-end frameworks are being designed? Evan You had recently given a pretty [great talk at JSConf.Asia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Vue.js+News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue+newsletter&amp;v=ANtSWq-zI0s) on that topic – check it out!

        Welcome back,
        
        If you are still worried about the recent function API RFC – please don’t! We heard your feedback and we’re grateful for it! 🙌 __Please know that there are no plans to ever deprecate the object-based API__. We’re also working on a new RFC and on a more high-level article to answer some of your concerns. Stay tuned!
        
        It’s also worth mentioning that every RFC (i.e. Request For Comments) is just us asking you for feedback on an idea and is never something set in stone. You can also propose your ideas the same way.
        
        Now back to the news – there will be a VueCamp Berlin this October for which I’m super excited. Contrary to typical conferences, this event allows everyone to share their ideas, give a talk or a workshop. You can read more about it [here](https://vuecamp.de/).
        
        Also, if you have been looking for a series of amazing Vue workshops – take a look at [Vue and Wine](https://vueand.me/). It’s a 3-days long series of workshops, lead by none other than [Natalia Tepluhina](https://twitter.com/N_Tepluhina), [Darek &quot;Gusto&quot; Wędrychowski](https://twitter.com/gustojs) and [Nicolò Maria Mezzopera](https://twitter.com/DonNicoJs). The dates are September 27-29th.

        Hello,
        
        probably the biggest RFC in Vue’s history has been published this week – the [function-based component API](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/function-apis/active-rfcs/0000-function-api.md). It’s a huge step towards better composability and type inference, though it also comes with some necessary sacrifices. Make sure to read it and join the [discussion](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/42) if you’d like to provide some additional feedback.
        
        VuePress 1.x stable release is here! There are some very important differences and improvements compared to 0.x, so make sure to read the [introduction article](https://medium.com/@_ulivz/intro-to-vuepress-1-x-7e2b7885f95f) by ULIVZ.

        Hello,
        
        I hope you had a great week. For us, the week was full or surprises. If you’re using Netflix, you might have seen a new series, where the main character is [using Vue to build the web app to sell certain *things* online](https://twitter.com/vuejs/status/1135383629960425474). And then, after the Apple conference, it turned out that the [new SwiftUI Tutorials page](https://twitter.com/znck0/status/1135651853776052224) is also using Vue for it’s interactive parts. Pretty rad!
        
        Nuxt.js v2.8 has been released with some pretty cool new improvements.
        
        Michael Thiessen has also written a [great article](https://michaelnthiessen.com/paradox-of-abstraction) how sometimes abstractions, when created too early, can cause you huge problems later on. This is especially important in the context of re-usability which is something what many developers strive to achieve.
        
        Also, a huge shoutout to [Ben Hong](http://twitter.com/bencodezen) for his incredible help with this issue! Thank you! 💚

        Hello,
        
        I hope you had a great weekend!
        
        Last week we had some pretty significant decisions made in the core team – namely to drop the Class API syntax for Vue 3.0. Don’t feel sad though, the TypeScript support will still be pretty amazing – we care about that a lot. And there are __composition functions__ coming which introduction is something I look forward the most when it comes to Vue core.
        
        Read [this comment](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/17#issuecomment-494242121) for more details.
        
        If you’re still sad – all the [talks from VueConf.US](https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-us-2019/) have been published – check them out. So much great content!
        
        Also if you wonder, what’s there to come for Nuxt.js, there’s a [great interview with Sebastien Chopin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=XkM34LI3cZU) on exactly that.

For example, using a calling console.log inside your application during SSR will still show that console log in your browser! This should make debugging so much easier!

        Hello!
        
        Whoa, there is so much content this week we had a really hard time picking up the articles (some of them might show up next week).
        
        First of all, [Vuex got a new release](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/releases/tag/v3.1.1) which will definitely make the NativeScript devs happy, since now it supports debugging with the remote Vue Devtools. 🎉
        
        The [Vue-CLI v4.0.0-alpha](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha.0) has also been released with several meaningful changes like bumping the versions on webpack-chain, core-js, ESLint, and workbox in the PWA plugin. Take it for a spin and let us know of any issues.
        
        Also, [Natalia](https://twitter.com/N_Tepluhina) has written an [amazing article](https://dev.to/n_tepluhina/apollo-state-management-in-vue-application-8k0) on managing state when using Apollo and is probably a must read those of you considering using Apollo in your project.

        Hello,
        
        I hope you had a great week! This week we’ve got lots of great content for you. 😃
        
        First, Vue Mastery has released [12 talks from the recent VueConf US](https://www.vuemastery.com/conferences/vueconf-us-2019/)! So many great presentations. You definitely don’t want to miss them.
        
        Secondly, if you look for another source of quality Vue content, you might want to check out the [Views on Vue podcast](https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue/). The podcast follows a different form than ours, as it contains interviews and discussions on a few selected topics with the invited guests. I’ve been one of those guests a few weeks ago and it was an amazing experience!
        
        And if you don’t have the time and are only looking for some quick tips, recently VueDose has published [a series of useful tricks](https://twitter.com/VueDose/status/1120246791985876992). Check them out.

        Hello,
        
        VueConf.us was complete blast, but that’s not the only North American conference that’s worth visiting. There’s another conference called VueConf.TO in Toronto, Canada. And I heard it’s pretty amazing! It’s happening in November and if you would like to speak there, here’s the [call for paper](https://vuetoronto.com/call-for-papers/)!
        
        If you don’t want to wait until November, or you’re simply based in Europe – make sure to check out the [VueDay conference in Alicante](https://vueday.org/), Spain! The date is Friday, May 31.
        
        There are few new releases: Nuxt.js [v2.6](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.6.0), Portal-Vue [v2.0](https://portal-vue.linusb.org/), Vue-Router [v3.0.3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/releases/tag/v3.0.3).

      <content:encoded>
        Hey,
        
        what an amazing week! Just got back home from VueConf.us. It was such a great conference. Interesting presentations, amazing people and so much [fun](https://twitter.com/jenlooper/status/1111353454465830912) in general. 🦄💃
        
        As for news: The new 5.0 version of Vue.js Devtools has been released! It comes with 2 new tabs – routing and performance, which allows you to measure your application for potential bottlenecks. It also ships with dark mode support 🌒.
        
        Also, there are 2 RFCs to Vue:
        
        One is the [advanced reactivity API](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/22), which I’m extremely excited about. It should allow you to create observable objects, watchers and computed properties, without actually creating a new Vue instance. This might prove extremely useful, especially for library authors. I imagine Vuelidate could benefit from it a lot.
        
        The 2nd RFC is about [dynamic lifecycle hooks injection](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/23). This should make it possible for you to conditionally add or remove lifecycle hooks within your component’s code.
        
        Oh, and [12 talks from Vue.js Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCxzy-hmQq9ECHOwbRrbBx0VEoqWM02CA&amp;utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) are already available. Check them out!

      <content:encoded>
        Hello,
        
        Do you like the new Vue-CLI? Can we still call it new? Well if you do, you will probably like the incoming v4 even more, because it should open the way for plugins to run codemods when upgrading to a new version of a plugin. This should make updating your app dependencies so much easier and quicker. [Here’s the v4.0 roadmap](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/3649?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
        
        Make sure to read the [new tutorial written by Cher Scarlett about building a Spotify-powered Vue app](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/spotify-app-vue-nuxt-javascript/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) – one of the best articles I’ve seen in months! 🎧
        
        There’s also a new RFC for introducing the Fetch hook in the upcoming 3.0 release of Nuxt.js. [Read more about it here](https://github.com/nuxt/rfcs/issues/27?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
        
        Also, FYI there’s a high chance we will be skipping next week issue due to VueConf.us. Come and say hi though if you’re there! 👋
        
        See you,

      <title>#134 - Improvements to SSR data-fetching in Vue 2.6, first recording from Vue.js Amsterdam, how to snapshot test and more</title>
      <link>https://news.vuejs.org/issues/134</link>
      <guid>https://news.vuejs.org/issues/134</guid>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        Hello!
        
        Great news for all server-side-rendering-enthusiasts out there! With Vue v2.6 the SSR data-fetching has been rewritten and now supports &quot;pausing&quot; during rendering, so that additional asynchronous data can be fetched. This opens the possibility to make requests not only in the route components, but in essentially any component that is being rendered. [Check out the new guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/data.html). 🚀
        
        Don’t go crazy though. Every request in a sequence increases the time before the page will be rendered, so keep that in mind.
        
        By the way, in just 2 weeks, me, Gregg and Adam will be at [VueConf.US](http://vueconf.us/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in Tampa, Florida. Come and say hi to us! If you still don’t have your ticket there *shameless plug* you can get a $100 discount per ticket when using the VUEMASTERY100 code.
        
        Btw. the first talk from Vue.js Amsterdam is here – [Guillaume Chau with &quot;Create a Vue CLI Plugin&quot;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&amp;v=9V4CUbTZj9E).

        Hello,
        
        how are you doing? Evan You has published a [new request for comments](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/17?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) regarding the introduction of native class API support. If you have any opinions on the topic, check out the RFC. Don’t worry though, this won’t affect the current object-based syntax. The change will however, make it unnecessary to use third party libraries like vue-class-component.
        
        Do you remember the State of Vue.js? Monterail released it back in 2017, and this week they published an [updated 2019 version](https://www.monterail.com/state-of-vuejs-report?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) with new interviews, case studies and an article by Evan You.

        Hey,
        
        I hope you’re great! I’ve got some pretty neat updates for you, especially if you’re using VS Code and Vetur. Because if you do, you have to see [the GIF in that tweet](https://twitter.com/octref/status/1097607993246416896). The tool now autosuggests available props and attrs for the components that you use 🤯.
        
        Also, Thorsten Lünborg AKA “Linusborg”, also known as the person closes to a real life-support for Vue, has [started his Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/linusborg). This means, if he ever helped you (and if you use the official Vue forums, I’m pretty sure he did) you can now buy him a coffee there. ☕️

        Hey!
        
        I have to tell you, Vue.js Amsterdam was a blast! 🚀 I’ve seen plenty of great talks, met lots of awesome people and had so much fun. I feel I’m still recovering from it (and the cold that I caught 🥶). Check out this [awesome Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tomquinonero/status/1096207213721542658) with most of the slides from the talks. Thanks [@tomquinonero](https://twitter.com/tomquinonero/)!
        
        As you probably noticed, there’s no podcast this week since apparently both Gregg and Adam are also recovering from the conference. Tough times. However, if you miss their voices already, make sure to check on [VueMastery.com](https://www.vuemastery.com/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) starting tomorrow (February 22–24) for a full weekend where all courses are free! 🎉

        Hello!
        
        Some interesting news this week, especially if you’re also working with Java. That’s because JHipster, a development platform for developing Java apps that use modern web frameworks for their front-end has now a blueprint for Vue.js. Still in beta, but looks very promising.
        
        There’s also a [great article about the introduction of “hooks”](https://css-tricks.com/what-hooks-mean-for-vue/) (inspired by React hooks) and what they mean for Vue.js, written by Sarah Drasner.
        
        By the way – our news team (that is me, Gregg and Adam), will be in Amsterdam this week at the Vue.js Amsterdam conference. Come and say hi!

        What a week! 🎉
        
        The 3rd of February was the 5th anniversary of Vue! Then the day after, on the 4th – [Vue v2.6 was officialy released](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-6-released-66aa6c8e785e) with tons of new features. And today we are celebrating the first day of the [Year of the Pig](https://chinesenewyear.net/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) according to the traditional Chinese calendar.
        
        Given that Vue was first released in 2014, it means Vue’s Chinese zodiac sign is a Horse! And you know what – I’m also a horse. Coincidence? I don’t think so! 🙃

        great news this week.

        Also, Nuxt.js has hit the [version 2.4.0](https://dev.to/nuxt/nuxtjs-v240-is-out-typescript-smart-prefetching-and-more-18d?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) with the long awaited TypeScript support and smart prefetching.

You can now do [those workshops](https://vuevixens.github.io/docs/workshop/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) yourself at home. The workshop website also includes some mini and nano exercises to polish up your Vue skills.
        
        
        Oh, and if you – by any chance – would like to show your support for my work on this newsletter, the Vue.js News website or one of the libraries that I started, you can do that now by [getting me a cup of coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/DamianDulisz?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)! ☕️ Thanks!

        Hey there,
        
        As the work on Vue 3.0 goes forward we reached the point where the first of many RFCs (request for comment) has been created. The RFC process is here to provide a consistent way for introducing new features and breaking changes to the framework core in cooperation with the community.
        
        This RFC is specifically about scoped-slots and how they should look like in 3.0. If you’re interested – [take a look](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/2).
        
        The biggest conferences of 2018 are back for the 2nd editions! In February, we will see each other back in Amsterdam for Vue.js Amsterdam. Then in March, the official VueConfUS takes place in Tampa, Florida.
        
        What you might have not known, is that just a month later, on 12th of April, there will be [VueDay in Verona, Italy](https://2019.vueday.it). If you’d like to speak there is still a chance – the CFP ends on 1st February.

        Good to be back after the holidays break. I hope you had a great time during holidays and and an awesome New Year so far! 🎉
        
        We received plenty of submissions through our [submit-your-story](https://news.vuejs.org/submit) page (too much to put in just one issue), that’s why we will take a few weeks to get through all of them. Thanks to everyone who submitted a story this way by the way! 💚 It makes our work so much easier.
        
        As for New Year’s resolutions – here’s the [official Vue roadmap](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/projects/6) for the first 3 quarters of 2019. You can use it to track the progress on version 3.0.

        Hello!
        
        Important news this week – due to a [security vulnerability](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116) found in a package called __*flatmap-stream*__ it is highly recommended to reinstall the global version of Vue-CLI using those commands:
        
        __For Yarn users:__
        
        ```
        yarn global remove @vue/cli 
        yarn global add @vue/cli
        ```
        
        
        
        __For Npm users:__
        
        ```
        npm uninstall -g @vue/cli 
        npm install -g @vue/cli
        ```
        
        
        It’s also recommended that you check your other projects for the malicious version of the library by using `yarn why flatmap-stream` or `npm list -g event-stream flatmap-stream`.

        Hello,
        
        what an insane week! Tons of conference content including slides from the VueConf Toronto conference, as well as 3 new videos from Connect.Tech event from the Vue.js path.
        
        There’s also a [great article](https://medium.com/vue-mastery/evan-you-previews-vue-js-3-0-ab063dec3547) by Gregg and Adam that sums up Evan’s talk about Vue.js 3.0.
        
        The results from the [State of JavaScript 2018](https://2018.stateofjs.com/introduction) survey are here! As anticipated – Vue’s adoption is increasing drastically and has the highest satisfaction rate out there among front-end frameworks!
        
        Also, please welcome [An Phan](https://twitter.com/notphanan), a fellow Vue.js core team member and the creator of [koel](https://github.com/phanan/koel), as he joins our News team! Great to have you on board!

        great news – Prettier now fully supports Vue templates. 🎉This means auto-formatting for template features like v-for, slot-scope and event handlers. All thanks to the awesome work by [@ikatyang](https://github.com/ikatyang). 👏
        
        Just a week until [VueConf Toronto](https://vuetoronto.com)! I’m looking at the fantastic line-up of speakers right now and I wish I could attend. 😥 It’s going to be a great event!
        
        Speaking of events – there are multiple incoming VueVixens workshops in the next 30 days that you might be interested in – check out this [tweet by Natalia Tepluhina](https://twitter.com/N_Tepluhina/status/1056855189125296128) for details.

      <content:encoded>
        Hello!
        Recently there’s a lot of buzz around Hooks – a new experimental addition to React, introduced by Dan Abramov a few days ago.
        Evan being Evan jumped right in on the idea and created [Vue-Hooks](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-hooks) – a library that implements hooks for Vue in less than 100 lines of code.
        So what are hooks exactly? It’s an alternative pattern to solve the code-sharing/reusability problem that is usually solved with mixins, higher-order components or render props (think scoped slots or renderless components).
        Hooks should help you extract shared logic that you wouldn’t be able to easily extract otherwise. If you ask me, hooks might become the go-to solution for working with different kinds of API calls and integrating services like real-time databases or chats. Maybe a new Apollo integration? Time will tell.
        
        *— Damian Dulisz*
        
        *P.S. Keep in mind the Vue-Hooks library is totally not production ready!*

        Hello,
        
        Do you know the [Views on Vue](https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) podcast? In the last week episode, the guests talked about contributing to open-source. Check it out if you’re interested in this topic!
        
        I’m very happy to let you know that I will be doing a full-day workshop in Warsaw, Poland on the 3rd of December. The workshop is titled &quot;[Ridiculously Reusable Components in Vue.js](https://frontend-con.io/product/vuejs/?utm_campaign=Vue.js%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)&quot; and focuses on efficient component design patterns that make the components easy to refactor and scale. All while avoiding premature optimisations.

        Hello,
        
        it’s incredible how much momentum NativeScript-Vue is getting since the initial announcement at Vue.js Amsterdam this year. Just half a year later, Jen Looper is already talking about the [2.0 release](https://dev.to/vuevixens/a-sneak-peek-of-nativescript-vue-20-k7j). 🔥
        
        If you’re looking for learning materials – here’s a really [good list](https://medium.com/hypefactors/a-brief-review-of-vue-learning-resources-state-of-2018-9f9ea0a08a89) by Dobromir Hristov with some of the available materials in 2018. One extra advice from me – join the [official Vue.js Discord server](https://chat.vuejs.org). Thousands of other likeminded developers ready to talk and help you on your journey! 🤖
        
        Speaking of the Discord channel – last weekend we had a Q&amp;A session with me and Chris Fritz about best practices. Check out the [transcription here](https://vue-land.js.org/q-and-a/).

        It’s also surprising (in a good way) that Vue has finally made it’s way into mainstream media in the form of an article on WIRED.
        
        Have you heard about the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos? There is now a [Vue version of it by Dave Follett](https://davefollett.io/categories/a-new-vue-on-javascript30/).

        Hello,
        if you had the chance to meet Chris Fritz, you might have noticed he has a really good radio voice. 😅 For those that don’t know – it’s a skill he quite often utilises on the [Views on Vue podcast](https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue/) where he’s one of the hosts. Unlike ours, this one is a few times longer and involves discussions between the hosts and sometimes – special guests.
        
        My friend Krzysztof Jung – the co-creator of this newsletter – has recently written an [amazing article](https://www.monterail.com/blog/3d-editor-vue.js-reactive-entity-system) about building a “3D interior design app” with Vue.js and BabylonJS. A must read, especially if you’re also into gamedev.

        Hey there,
        
        the Vue.js Sprint has already ended – it was truly a amazing week. 8 people, 6 days, ~10h of work per day). We managed to make significant progress on several projects, most notably, but not limited to, the Vue Devtools.
        
        There’s also an updated version of the this website where you can now search through all the stories we published. See __Search__ link in navbar.
        
        Other projects like the eslint-plugin-vue have also seen additional improvements.
        
        We also managed to organise a rather large meet-up for the local community which gathered around 130 people. Talks were recorded and are expected to be published by next week.
        
        All this is thanks to you and your continuous support on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/vuejs/). 💚❤️💛 I will be writing a more detailed article about what exactly has been done, hopefully by the end of the week.
        
        Great news for everyone living in South and Central America – A new Vue conference called [Vue.js Summit](https://vuejssummit.com/) is coming to Säo Paulo, Brazil in late August. Check it out!
        
        Also, [VueConf TO](https://vuetoronto.com/tickets/) early bird tickets are available now! Many great talks and workshops there.

        Hey,
        
        I have some great news from the front – we’re still alive and kicking! 
        
        The Vue.js Sprint is going very well and we already made significant progress on a number of tasks. Those include finishing some new eslint-plugin-vue rules, adding those to a brand new eslint config tab inside the Vue CLI UI. There are also __huge performance improvements__ to both the events and Vuex tabs inside the Vue Devtools. Oh and did I mention the [Beta release](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg)?
        
        I personally worked on the News 2.0 release which will include support for tags for every story we publish along with a way to search through all the stories we published.
        
        Of course that’s not all we did and we still got 3 days before us. You can expect a proper summary of the whole sprint around next week!

        I’m very happy to announce that along with several other Vue core team members we will be organising a free community meetup in Wrocław, Poland on Thursday next week (August 2nd). The meetup is to be called the [Vue.js Core Team Summit](https://www.meetup.com/Vue-js-Poland/events/253095286/) and we intent to organise those meetups whenever we’re gathering for the Vue sprint. 
        
        Wondering what’s a Vue sprint? It’s a special week where members of the core team gather together in one place and work on different Vue tools and libraries like Vue-Devtools.
        
        I will let you know about all the things we will be working on next week!

        Vue.js London conference has announced several new talks – you can check the speakers list [here](https://vuejs.london/schedule). Additionally, VueVixens will be running a two free half-day workshops among other workshops that happen a day before the conference. Here’s a [list of all the announced workshops](https://vuejs.london/workshops/).
        
        And as always – many new articles and tutorials. Dig in!

        A great week for the Vue ecosystem! [Vue-Storefront](https://www.vuestorefront.io/), the largest eCommerce-related Vue open-source project I know about, [has hit the 1.0 version](https://medium.com/@piotrkarwatka/vue-storefront-1-0-1e6c9cfe8075). This means it is now officially stable and production ready. That’s great to hear since I personally believe that having a PWA-based front app might be the next big thing for online stores.
        
        Also, Ilkwon Sim has [released a repo](https://github.com/learn-vuejs/vue-patterns) that includes a dozen useful Vue-patterns and tricks that can be used when you just need that quick look at the reference of things like scoped slots syntax.
        
        As you might know, Vue.js Roadtrip Paris happened last week and we got 4 presentations for you to check out!

        In case you haven’t noticed, this is the 100th issue! 🎉
        
        It means we’re doing this for around 700 days now! And since last week, we passed the 10,000 subscribers mark! It has been an awesome journey so far and I’m extremely grateful to everyone involved in making the Official Vue News what it is now. This includes Evan You (for creating Vue), Krzysztof Jung (for starting it with me), Monterail (for the constant financial support), Gregg Pollack and Adam Jahr from Vue Mastery (for bringing it to the next level) and all the other people that helped along the way! This wouldn’t be possible without your help.
        
        I really hope we can do this for the next 700 days. 💚
        
        Until then, enjoy this week&apos;s stories!
        
        Btw, you can now get tickets for Vue.js London conference!

        Hey,
        
        do you know that Vue has a Discord server called Vue-Land? Do you know that this particular server just had its first anniversary? If you don’t, go to [chat.vuejs.org](https://chat.vuejs.org) and join the 35000 users from all over the world. It’s a great place to get help with your code problems, discuss possible solutions or simply help others.
        
        Speaking of communities and helping others – [CMTY v0.3](https://cmty.app/meta/cmty/releases/v0.3.0) has just been released. It’s a platform that makes it easier to build and manage communities around open-source projects. Created by the Chopin brothers – the creators of Nuxt.js.
        
        Oh, and you might want to check the new [Mand Mobile UI-kit](https://didi.github.io/mand-mobile/). It looks really neat!

We&apos;re also working on improving the RSS feed, which you can subscribe to by clicking [here](http://news.vuejs.org/feed.xml).

        Wow – we got soo many submissions this week through our [submit form](https://news.vuejs.org/submit) that we had to split them in two! If your story can’t be found in this issue, no worries – it should appear next week.

        I can’t believe I only now learned about [VueMeetups.org](https://vuemeetups.org) – a very nice initiative by Ben Hong. It’s the biggest list of Vue meetups around the world that I have ever seen. Try it out, you might just find one near you.
        
        Also, with the latest beta release of [Vue-CLI you can take the brand new UI for a spin](https://twitter.com/Akryum/status/1001893636194390016)! Just update vue-cli and run `vue ui` in your console. As always, feedback is welcome.
        
        Oh, and Krutie Patel is at it again – with a [brand new infographic explaining](https://twitter.com/KrutiePatel/status/1002781159997100033/photo/1) Nuxt.js modules, serverMiddleware and plugins. Check it out!

        If you’re interested in contributing to the Vue ecosystem, better start planning your schedule for next Wednesday because [Vue Contributor Day](https://www.thisdot.co/events/attend-vue-contributor-days) is just around the corner.
        
        [EGOIST](https://github.com/egoist), who you might know as a notorious library author (600 repositories and counting) has released a new framework called [Saber.js](https://github.com/egoist/saber.js) for building static websites based on Vue.js. It works similar to VuePress though it’s probably more for general use cases as it does not enforce any theme system. 
        
        Also, [Krutie Patel](https://twitter.com/KrutiePatel) made an [awesome diagram](https://twitter.com/KrutiePatel/status/1000022559184764930) describing all the lifecycle hooks in a Nuxt.js app.
        
        Enjoy!

        I just learned about [Vuido](https://github.com/mimecorg/vuido) – a fork of Vue that makes it possible to create native desktop applications without the need for Electron. 🔥
        Underneath it uses libui, a GUI library written in C. Though it’s still in its early stages I’m incredibly impressed by the work Michał Męciński (the author) has done. I wonder what possibilities it might open.
        
        There’s also a very nice [summary](https://blog.webf.zone/vue-js-considerations-and-tricks-fa7e0e4bb7bb?gi=c43d2e67a509) of some of the design decisions behind Vue written by Harshal Patil. The article additionally includes links to issues with the discussions about some of those decisions.
