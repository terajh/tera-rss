      <content:encoded>Imagine ending your workday and waking up to new features coded, tested, and ready for review. This is the promise of autonomous AI coding agents harnessing tools like Claude Code in continuous loops to improve and ship code while you sleep. In this write-up, I will ll cover how to set up these self-improving agent loops, covering everything from orchestrating the loops and structuring context files to memory persistence, QA validation, scaling, debugging, and risk management.</content:encoded>

      <title>Your AI coding agents need a manager</title>
      <link>https://addyosmani.com/blog/coding-agents-manager/</link>
      <guid>https://addyosmani.com/blog/coding-agents-manager/</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>In the near future, high-leverage developers look like async-first managers running parallel AI coding agents. The skills that make someone a strong tech lead or manager translate directly to AI coding - because at scale, it stops being just a context problem and becomes a management problem.</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>AI did not kill code review. It made the burden of proof explicit. Ship changes with evidence like manual verification and automated tests, then use review for risk, intent, and accountability.</content:encoded>
