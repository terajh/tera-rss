      <content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Vue 2.6 released&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we just celebrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vuejs/status/1092091579119087616&quot;&gt;the 5th Vueniversary &lt;/a&gt;— today we are excited to announce the release of Vue 2.6 “Macross”!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*gNx3jSKwLvYhG12fznDyjQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past year, we spent a lot of time working on the new CLI and prototyping for 3.0. As a result, Vue core 2.x hasn’t received major updates in quite a while. It’s about time! This release combines a number of substantial improvements, internal changes and new features which are highlighted in this post. For full details, make sure to also check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/releases/tag/v2.6.0&quot;&gt;full release note&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slots: New Syntax, Performance Improvements &amp;amp; Alignment with 3.0&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slots is an important mechanism that enables flexible component composition in Vue. During the prototyping for 3.0 we discovered a number of ways to improve it. Some of these can be introduced without breaking changes, which allows us to ship them in a 2.x minor release. For those that do require breaking changes, we are also trying to provide progressive alternatives in 2.x that would make future migrations easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;New Syntax&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is the new syntax of scoped slots. We proposed, discussed and experimented with a number of different designs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9180&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/9306&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/2&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) and eventually landed on the new v-slot syntax outlined in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0001-new-slot-syntax.md&quot;&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a brief example using named slots:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/e0e183f6de3edd82087db00cfe362079/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/e0e183f6de3edd82087db00cfe362079/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new syntax unifies the usage of normal and scoped slots in a single directive, and enforces more explicit and readable named slots usage. It is also fully compatible with the existing syntax, which allows us to ship it today in 2.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are already familiar with the existing slot syntax, we recommend you to read through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0001-new-slot-syntax.md&quot;&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt; to better understand the rationale behind the new syntax. If you are not yet familiar with slots, it is recommended to go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html&quot;&gt;updated slots documentation&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Performance Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another improvement for slots we would like to see in 3.0 is the unification of normal vs. scoped slots in terms of implementation, due to the performance advantage of scoped slots. Normal slots are rendered during the parent’s render cycle. When a dependency of a slot changes, it causes both the parent and child components to re-render. Scoped slots, on the other hand, are compiled into inline functions and called during the child component’s render cycle. This means any data dependencies relied on by a scoped slot are collected by the child component, resulting in more precise updates. In 2.6, we have introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/9371&quot;&gt;an optimization&lt;/a&gt; that further ensures parent scope dependency mutations only affect the parent and would no longer force the child component to update if it uses only scoped slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All slots using the new v-slot syntax are compiled into scoped slots. This means all slots using the new syntax automatically get the performance improvements;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All normal slots are now also exposed on this.$scopedSlots as functions. This means users using render functions instead of templates can now always use this.$scopedSlots without worrying what type of slots are being passed in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 3.0, there will no longer be the distinction between scoped vs. non-scoped slots — all slots will use the same unified syntax, are compiled into the same format, and have the same optimal performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Async Error Handling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue’s built-in error handling mechanism (in-component errorCaptured hook and the global errorHandler hook) now also captures errors inside v-on handlers. In addition, if any of your lifecycle hooks or event handlers performs asynchronous operations, you can now return a Promise from the function so that any uncaught errors from that Promise chain are also sent to your error handlers. It becomes even easier if you are using async/await, since async functions implicitly return Promises:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/287b09a6ff2fd0c6ef41742720264172/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/287b09a6ff2fd0c6ef41742720264172/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dynamic Directive Arguments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directive arguments can now accept dynamic JavaScript expressions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/2cd1846af3dcbfa2926cab1b53277464/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/2cd1846af3dcbfa2926cab1b53277464/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details can be found in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/blob/master/active-rfcs/0003-dynamic-directive-arguments.md&quot;&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt;. Conveniently, if the argument value is null, the binding/listener will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Note to library authors: this feature requires the Vue runtime to be of version 2.6.0 or higher. If you ship pre-compiled components and want to maintain compatibility with versions before 2.6, avoid using this in your source code.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Code Frame in Compiler Warning Messages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7127&quot;&gt;stellar pull request&lt;/a&gt; by GitHub user @gzzhanghao, starting in 2.6 most template compilation warnings now comes with source range information. This has enabled us to generate nice code frames for these warnings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kbLs5moJmle5cG9YL3yJ2A.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Explicit Creation of Standalone Reactive Objects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.6 introduces a new global API to explicitly create standalone reactive objects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/cd00645e9abd739b6f8984ab0c6d3b66/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/cd00645e9abd739b6f8984ab0c6d3b66/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting object can be used directly in computed properties or render functions, and will trigger appropriate updates when mutated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Data Pre-fetching during Server Side Rendering&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssr.vuejs.org/api/#serverprefetch&quot;&gt;new &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ssr.vuejs.org/api/#serverprefetch&quot;&gt;serverPrefetch hook&lt;/a&gt; allows any component (instead of just route-level components) to pre-fetch data during server-side rendering, allowing for more flexible usage and reducing the coupling between data fetching and the router. Projects like Nuxt and vue-apollo are already planning to simplify their implementations using this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ES Module Build for Direct Import&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, our ES Module build is primarily intended for use with bundlers. These builds contain usage of environment variables that are meant to be replaced at compile time. Vue 2.6 now also provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://unpkg.com/vue@2.6.0/dist/vue.esm.browser.js&quot;&gt;an ES Module build that are intended for direct in-browser usage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/7d620b6c0acb1dfce1410ab3b7c515ad/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/7d620b6c0acb1dfce1410ab3b7c515ad/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Important Internal Changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Reverting nextTick to Microtask&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2.5.0 we made an internal adjustment that caused nextTickto use Macrotasks instead of Microtasks to queue updates if the update was triggered in a v-on event handler. This was originally intended to fix some browser edge cases, but has in turn led to a number of other issues. In 2.6 we have found a simpler fix for the original issue, which allows us to revert nextTick to consistently use Microtasks in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in more technical details, check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/yyx990803/d1a0eaac052654f93a1ccaab072076dd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Functions on this.$scopedSlots now always return Arrays&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This change only affects render function users.) In render functions, scoped slots are exposed on this.$scopedSlots as functions. Up until now, calling a scoped slot function can return a single VNode or an Array of VNodes based on what the parent component is passing in. This was honestly an oversight as it makes the return value type indeterministic and can lead to unintended edge cases. In 2.6, scoped slot functions are now guaranteed to return either an Array of VNodes or undefined. This may affect some existing code if it is not properly checking for possible Array return values.

      <title>Plans for the Next Iteration of Vue.js</title>

      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Sep 2018 13:52:46 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last week at &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.london/summary&quot;&gt;Vue.js London&lt;/a&gt; I gave a brief sneak peek of what’s coming in the next major version of Vue. This post provides an in-depth overview of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vFC8tDUGLlXIiqT7ymf3xg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why a new major version?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue 2.0 was released &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-0-is-here-ef1f26acf4b8&quot;&gt;exactly two years ago&lt;/a&gt; (how time flies!). During this period, the core has remained backwards compatible with five minor releases. We’ve accumulated a number of ideas that would bring improvements, but they were held off because they would result in breaking changes. At the same time, the JavaScript ecosystem and the language itself has been evolving rapidly. There are greatly improved tools that could enhance our workflow, and many new language features that could unlock simpler, more complete, and more efficient solutions to the problems Vue is trying to solve. What’s more exciting is that we are seeing ES2015 support becoming a baseline for all major evergreen browsers. Vue 3.0 aims to leverage these new language features to make Vue core smaller, faster, and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue 3.0 is currently in prototyping phase, and we have already implemented a runtime close to feature-parity with 2.x. &lt;strong&gt;Many of the items listed below are either already implemented, or confirmed to be feasible. Ones that are not yet implemented or still in exploration phase are marked with a *.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Details&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;High-Level API Changes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TL;DR: Everything except render function API and scoped-slots syntax will either remain the same or can be made 2.x compatible via a compatibility build.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it’s a new major, there is going to be some breaking changes. However, we take backwards compatibility seriously, so we want to start communicating these changes as soon as possible. Here’s the currently planned public API changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Template syntax will remain 99% the same. There may be small tweaks in scoped slots syntax, but other than that we have no plans to change anything else for templates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;̶3̶.̶0̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶s̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶c̶l̶a̶s̶s̶-̶b̶a̶s̶e̶d̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶o̶n̶e̶n̶t̶s̶ ̶n̶a̶t̶i̶v̶e̶l̶y̶ . &lt;em&gt;Update: the Class API draft has been dropped. We have published a new &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/42&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;function-based API proposal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that provides better logic composition, better TypeScript support, and compatible with 2.x API.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mixins will still be supported.*&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top level APIs will likely receive an overhaul to avoid globally mutating the Vue runtime when installing plugins. Instead, plugins will be applied and scoped to a component tree. This will make it easier to test components that rely on specific plugins, and also make it possible to mount multiple Vue applications on the same page with different plugins, but using the same Vue runtime.* &lt;em&gt;(Update: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;related RFC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional components can finally be plain functions —however, async components will now need to be explicitly created via a helper function. &lt;em&gt;(Update: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/27&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;related RFC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The part that will receive the most changes is the Virtual DOM format used in render functions. We are currently collecting feedback from major library authors and will be sharing more details as we are more confident of the changes, but as long as you don’t heavily rely on hand-written (non-JSX) render functions in your app, upgrading should be a reasonably straightforward process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Source Code Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TL;DR: better decoupled internal modules, TypeScript, and a codebase that is easier to contribute to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are re-writing 3.0 from the ground up for a cleaner and more maintainable architecture, in particular trying to make it easier to contribute to. We are breaking some internal functionalities into individual packages in order to isolate the scope of complexity. For example, the observer module will become its own package, with its own public API and tests. Note this does not affect framework-level API— you will not have to manually import individual bits from multiple packages in order to use Vue. Instead, the final Vue package is assembled using these internal packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The codebase is also now written in TypeScript. Although this will make proficiency in TypeScript a pre-requisite for contributing to the new codebase, we believe the type information and IDE support will actually make it easier for a new contributor to make meaningful contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decoupling the observer and scheduler into separate packages also allows us to easily experiment with alternative implementations of these parts. For example, we can implement an IE11 compatible observer implementation with the same API, or an alternative scheduler that leverages requestIdleCallback to yield to the browser during long updates.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/460/1*H8yM0usFhWYlY6GV2wcrEw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sneak peek of the new source code structure (subject to change)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Observation Mechanism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TL;DR: more complete, precise, efficient and debuggable reactivity tracking &amp;amp; API for creating observables.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.0 will ship with a Proxy-based observer implementation that provides reactivity tracking with full language coverage. This eliminates a number of limitations of Vue 2’s current implementation based on Object.defineProperty :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detection of property addition / deletion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detection of Array index mutation / .length mutation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for Map, Set, WeakMap and WeakSet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new observer also features the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exposed API for creating observables. This offers a light-weight, dead simple cross-component state management solution for small to medium scale scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lazy observation by default. In 2.x, any reactive data, regardless of how big it is, will be observed on startup. This can cause a noticeable overhead on app startup if your dataset is huge. In 3.x, only data used to render the initially visible part of your app will need to be observed, not to mention the observation itself is also much faster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More precise change notification. An example: in 2.x, force adding a new property using Vue.set will cause any watcher that depends on the object to re-evaluate. In 3.x, only watchers that relies on that specific property will be notified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immutable observables: we can create “immutable” versions of a value that prevents mutations even on nested properties, except when the system temporarily unlocks it internally. This mechanism can be used to freeze passed-down props or Vuex state trees outside mutations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better debugging capabilities: we can precisely trace when and why a component re-render is tracked or triggered using the new renderTracked and renderTriggered hooks:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*waSYB1v2aRgUFx21-JSwRg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Easily understand why a component is re-rendering&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Other Runtime Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TL;DR: smaller, faster, tree-shakable features, fragments &amp;amp; portals, custom renderer API.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smaller: the new codebase is designed from the ground up to be tree-shaking friendly. Features such as built-in components (&amp;lt;transition&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;keep-alive&amp;gt;) and directive runtime helpers (v-model) are now imported on-demand and tree-shakable. &lt;strong&gt;The constant baseline size for the new runtime is &amp;lt;10kb gzipped.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition, features being tree-shakable also allows us to offer more built-in features down the road without incurring payload penalties for users that don’t use them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Faster: on preliminary benchmarks, we are seeing up to 100% performance improvement across the board, including raw Virtual DOM mounting &amp;amp; patching (we learned quite a few tricks from &lt;a href=&quot;https://infernojs.org/&quot;&gt;Inferno&lt;/a&gt;, the fastest Virtual DOM implementation out there), component instance initialization and data observation. 3.0 will shave off half the time spent in JavaScript when your app boots up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fragments &amp;amp; Portals: despite the size reduction, 3.0 comes with built-in support for Fragments (component returning multiple root nodes) and Portals (rendering a sub-tree in another part of the DOM, instead of inside the component).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved slots mechanism: All compiler-generated slots are now functions and invoked during the child component’s render call. This ensures dependencies in slots are collected as dependencies for the child instead of the parent. This means that: 1. when slot content changes, only the child re-renders; 2. when the parent re-renders, the child does not have to if its slot content did not change. This change offers even more precise change detection at the component tree level, so even fewer useless re-renders!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom Renderer API: a first-class API for creating custom renderers will be available, and no longer requires forking the Vue codebase with custom modifications. This will make it much easier for render-to-native projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://weex-project.io/&quot;&gt;Weex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nativescript-vue.org/&quot;&gt;NativeScript Vue&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date with upstream changes. It would also make it trivially easy to create custom renderers for various other purposes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Compiler Improvements*&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TL;DR: tree-shaking friendly output, more AOT optimizations, parser with better error info and source map support.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When targeting tree-shaking-capable bundlers, templates that make use of optional features will generate code that imports those features using ES modules syntax. Unused optional features are thus dropped from the final bundle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Due to improvements in the new Virtual DOM implementation, we are also able to perform more effective compile-time optimizations such as static tree hoisting, static props hoisting, compiler-hints for runtime to skip children normalization, VNode creation fast paths, etc…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We plan to rewrite the parser to provide location information in template compilation errors. This should also lead to template source map support, and the new parser can serve as the foundation for 3rd party tooling integration, such as eslint-plugin-vue and IDE language services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;IE11 Support*&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TL;DR: it will be supported, but in a separate build with the same reactivity limitations of Vue 2.x.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new codebase currently targets evergreen browsers only and assumes baseline native ES2015 support. But alas, we know a lot of our users still need to support IE11 for the foreseeable future. Most of the ES2015 features used can be transpiled / polyfilled for IE11, with the exception for Proxies. Our plan is to implement an alternative observer with the same API, but using the good old ES5 Object.defineProperty API. A separate build of Vue 3.x will be distributed using this observer implementation. However, this build will be subject to the same change detection caveats of Vue 2.x and thus not fully compatible with the “modern” build of 3.x. We are aware that this imposes some inconvenience for library authors as they will need to be aware of compatibility for two different builds, but we will make sure to provide clear guidelines on this when we reach that stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Do We Get There&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, although we are announcing it today, we do not have a definitive timeline yet. What we do know at the moment is the steps we will be taking to get there:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Internal Feedback for the Runtime Prototype&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the phase we are in right now. Currently, we already have a working runtime prototype that includes the new observer, Virtual DOM and component implementation. We have invited a group of authors of influential community projects to provide feedback for the internal changes, and would like to make sure they are comfortable with the changes before moving forward. We want to ensure that important libraries in the ecosystem will be ready at the same time when we release 3.0, so that users relying on those projects can upgrade easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Public Feedback via RFCs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we gain a certain level of confidence in the new design, for each breaking change we will be opening a dedicated RFC issue which includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scope of the change;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reasoning behind the change: what do we gain, and what tradeoffs are being made;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Upgrade path: can it be introduced in a completely backwards-compatible fashion, via a removable compatibility layer, or via codemods?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will anticipate public feedback from the wider community to help us consolidate these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Introduce Compatible Features in 2.x &amp;amp; 2.x-next&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not forgetting about 2.x! In fact, we plan to use 2.x to progressively accustom users to the new changes. We will be gradually introducing confirmed API changes into 2.x via opt-in adaptors, and 2.x-next will allow users to try out the new Proxy-based observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last minor release in 2.x will become LTS and continue to receive bug and security fixes for 18 months when 3.0 is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Alpha Phase&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we will finish up the compiler and server-side rendering parts of 3.0 and start making alpha releases. These will mostly be for stability testing purposes in small greenfield apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Beta Phase&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;During beta phase, our main goal is updating support libraries and tools like Vue Router, Vuex, Vue CLI, Vue DevTools and make sure they work smoothly with the new core. We will also be working with major library authors from the community to help them get ready for 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. RC Phase&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we consider the API and codebase stable, we will enter RC phase with API freeze. During this phase we will also work on a “compat build”: a build of 3.0 that includes compatibility layers for 2.x API. This build will also ship with a flag you can turn on to emit deprecation warnings for 2.x API usage in your app. The compat build can be used as a guide to upgrade your app to 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7. IE11 build&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last task before the final release will be the IE11 compatibility build as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8. Final Release&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, we don’t know when this will happen yet, but likely in 2019. Again, we care more about shipping something that is solid and stable rather than hitting specific dates. There is a lot of work to be done, but we are excited for what’s coming next!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=777ffea6fabf&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/plans-for-the-next-iteration-of-vue-js-777ffea6fabf&quot;&gt;Plans for the Next Iteration of Vue.js&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;The First Vue.js Sprint — Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue.js Sprint is a new initiative that aims to &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; bring together members of the Vue team to work on core projects for at least several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Damian Dulisz on Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first day of the @vuejs sprint. Working in person is weird... But we&amp;#39;re getting stuff done! 😄 Thanks @DivanteLTD for the excellent office space! 💼 🏢&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quick facts:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Location: Wrocław, Poland&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8 core team members (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/29f499dc71d6&quot;&gt;Alex Kyriakidis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/498f8fe0ad12&quot;&gt;Chris Fritz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/62293223da92&quot;&gt;Denis Karabaza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/9bafe4e8ffdd&quot;&gt;Guillaume CHAU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/bdecd935ca2&quot;&gt;Michał Sajnóg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/54660ec11a28&quot;&gt;Nick Messing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/6d65d2ce79f8&quot;&gt;Rahul Kadyan&lt;/a&gt; and me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/866bc83ce0b3&quot;&gt;Damian Dulisz&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6 working days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8–10 work hours per day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;~432 total work hours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first sprint, organised by Guillaume and me, we ended up picking Wrocław for the location. It’s a pretty special city for us. It’s here where most of us met for the very first time during VueConf EU last year. Another reason for picking Poland was that it’s more on the cheaper side on the cost-of-living-spectrum. This becomes quite important if you plan a stay for 8 people. More details on the total costs later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before diving to what we have been working on, in the name of the whole team I would like to say thanks to all those that made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biggest thanks goes to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/vuejs&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;incredible backers on Open Collective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — know that all this wouldn’t be possible without your continuous support!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://divante.co/&quot;&gt;Divante&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monterail.com/&quot;&gt;Monterail&lt;/a&gt; who hosted us for 5 days in their offices and provided us with everything we needed to do our work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9orExlPdnobLokcbmXX7zA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OspvXU5YG40QV84socYcnQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SMUzOQUOVUCxrN1sQXXeEg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JxBn8ozF5-EU30QUMiZreA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UmwysgmmTYEPrmqGa85tFQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1doGFELXBtG_o70qtZNBhA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HIFYMSfqkYGflcFJTY0Mgg.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HBe1J7THqXJoClMNccIPiw.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now let’s get through the main topics we focused on during the week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vue.js Devtools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involved&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/9bafe4e8ffdd&quot;&gt;Guillaume CHAU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/6d65d2ce79f8&quot;&gt;Rahul Kadyan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/29f499dc71d6&quot;&gt;Alex Kyriakidis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/866bc83ce0b3&quot;&gt;Damian Dulisz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/bdecd935ca2&quot;&gt;Michał Sajnóg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/498f8fe0ad12&quot;&gt;Chris Fritz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/62293223da92&quot;&gt;Denis Karabaza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the most prominent project we worked on did during the sprint. Main focus: &lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt;. In terms of devtools performance itself as well as the new &lt;strong&gt;performance tab&lt;/strong&gt;, that should make it possible to benchmark your app and look for possible bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Guillaume Chau on Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commiting 20,000 mutations in one frame now takes less than 2 seconds to be displayed in the @vuejs devtools. Loading the last commit vuex state takes less than a second. Emitting 10,000 events now displays them almost instantly in the devtools events tab as well. 🔥&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overall performance improvements (much lower memory usage, faster scrolling, jumping between Vuex mutations).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance Tab: Track your app performance (measured by frames per second) and correlate it with different events happening inside the application like Vuex mutations, router changes, events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Router Tab: Preview Vue-Router history along with params as well as the list of all currently available routes. This feature is heavily based on the awesome work contributed by A&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/armano2&quot;&gt;rmano&lt;/a&gt; and Markus Sorg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improvements to the Vuex tab: You can now edit Vuex state from within the devtools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alex Kyriakidis on Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now edit Vuex state in @vuejs devtools like component&amp;#39;s data ✌️ #vuejs #vuesprint https://t.co/qHwaGj5WG7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved support for remote debugging for Cordova and NativeScript based applications by making the devtools backend platform agnostic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for displaying functional components inside the component tree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved component name detection for 3rd-party components&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High density display support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Michał Sajnóg on Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debugging remote vue devtools using remote vue devtools with @znck0 Fun! 😃 Exciting improvements are underway! #VueJs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ESLint-Plugin-Vue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involved&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/bdecd935ca2&quot;&gt;Michał Sajnóg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/498f8fe0ad12&quot;&gt;Chris Fritz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for several new rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with Vue CLI 3.0 UI – You can now change your ESLint configuration using the GUI. Try it out by installing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-plugin-eslint&quot;&gt;@vue/cli-plugin-eslint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JSX plugin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involved&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/54660ec11a28&quot;&gt;Nick Messing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/6d65d2ce79f8&quot;&gt;Rahul Kadyan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/498f8fe0ad12&quot;&gt;Chris Fritz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great news for all those that prefer to use JSX instead of templates. Now you will be able to use directives, like v-model when writing JSX!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for Vue directives inside JSX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for arguments and modifiers for directives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updated documentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;News.vuejs.org&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involved&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/866bc83ce0b3&quot;&gt;Damian Dulisz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/498f8fe0ad12&quot;&gt;Chris Fritz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search functionality for published stories, transforming the website from weekly-news oriented to a potentially, searchable knowledge source.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stories now have tags and can be browsed/searched based on those.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for additional story types: images, tweets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Damian Dulisz on Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;🚀 You can now search through all the @vuejs stories that we published on @VueNewsletter by using the https://t.co/fQ45kYbj1c tool! You can also filter stories based on tags! More updates coming! #VueJS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fixes and features in other libraries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involved&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/62293223da92&quot;&gt;Denis Karabaza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/29f499dc71d6&quot;&gt;Alex Kyriakidis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/498f8fe0ad12&quot;&gt;Chris Fritz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/866bc83ce0b3&quot;&gt;Damian Dulisz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved mutation tracking in Vuex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accessing name-spaced getters in Vuex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SSR Documentation improvements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigating existing issues in Vue core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The first Vue.js Core Team Summit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t miss the occasion that we were all in one place. That’s why we decided to organise a very special meetup. One that we would like to repeat in the future, whenever we’re doing a Vue sprint. That’s how the first &lt;em&gt;Vue.js Core Team Summit&lt;/em&gt; was born. We aimed for it to be a free, for-the-community, close-and-personal kind of event and I think we succeeded in doing that. More than 130 people came to the event, which was taking place in the awesome Monterail’s office. Once again thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Monterail&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Divante&lt;/strong&gt; for helping us with the hard work of organising the event! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hai43R4coVNB3677eHqfyQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Piotr Małecki-Jurek&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The event consisted of two talks and a Q&amp;amp;A session with the team.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpc9AZg2KOM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;Introduction to Vue CLI 3 and its UI&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/9bafe4e8ffdd&quot;&gt;Guillaume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpK6vGkeb5s&quot;&gt;How to bikeshed Vue apps&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/498f8fe0ad12&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the quality of the 2nd recording — Chris took us all by surprise, when he asked the whole team to join him on stage 2 minutes before the start. Chris really used his background as a teacher and asked the team tough questions on how we use Vue in our work. Sadly we were not ready for that kind of a twist — recording-wise at least. The talk was extremely fun and educational at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*slgdOlGlR67wG1hgvYhQvQ.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Piotr Małecki-Jurek&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Breakdown of the total costs of the sprint&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two-way flights: $4 635,79&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 four-bed AirBnb apartments: $1 291,83&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Food, stickers and other expenses: ~$1 100,00&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total: $7 027,62&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are all the expenses that we kept track of. Food includes breakfast and lunch that we ate on our way to work or had it delivered to the office. It also includes some of the additional travel and accommodation costs (transport from and to the airport, home utilities that were needed in the apartments. etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was far from what we got used to when working on Vue related projects (and open source projects in general). Usually the feedback loop is much longer, things have to be written down properly and the decision making process can take days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from what we’ve managed to accomplish during the sprint I’m really happy that we finally got to know each other. Spending time with people that share similar values and excitement about doing open source software as you do is a big motivator and a great ice breaker. I feel super encouraged to work on things that I didn’t had a chance to work on before. Can’t wait to meet the rest of the team!&lt;br&gt;— Michał Sajnóg&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the sprint it was the complete opposite. I think all of us were kind of surprised by how smooth the work was going. It was refreshing how much we can accomplish thanks to having the right people to talk to the very moment we needed them. It made a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were able to brainstorm a lot and maybe some of the ideas we thought of will be implemented in the near future. 😊&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We spent a lot of time increasing our future contribution capacities through pairing, open discussion, and informal training. Even when we’re not together, it’ll now be easier for any of us to contribute to a greater variety of projects, in a greater variety of ways!&lt;br&gt;— Chris Fritz&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we will be able to have another sprint in the coming months. If you have any suggestions where we should be traveling next — let us know in the comments section!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Vue.js Sprint was a unique and productive experience. We got the chance to collaborate in person, brainstorm, and pair code. In my opinion, we produced a value that would normally have taken months. I think moves like this prove that supporting the framework you use and love is a great investment. I will be happy to contribute to the Vue Ecosystem again in the next Sprint we will hopefully have.&lt;br&gt;— Alex Kyriakidis&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again — big thanks to all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/vuejs/#contributors&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Collective supporters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;! 💚&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you would like to help make the next sprint happen — consider becoming a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opencollective.com/vuejs/#&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;backer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=10c260bf642a&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/the-first-vue-js-sprint-summary-10c260bf642a&quot;&gt;The First Vue.js Sprint - Summary&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2018 15:09:19 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, we’ve been working really hard on the next generation of Vue CLI, the standard build toolchain for Vue applications. Today we are thrilled to announce the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue CLI 3.0&lt;/a&gt; and all the exciting features that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rich Built-in Features&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue CLI 3 is a completely different beast from its previous version. The goal of the rewrite is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce configuration fatigue of modern frontend tooling, especially when mixing multiple tools together;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporate best practices in the toolchain as much as possible so it becomes the default for any Vue app.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core, Vue CLI provides a pre-configured build setup built on top of webpack 4. We aim to minimize the amount of configuration developers have to go through, so any Vue CLI 3 project comes with out-of-the-box support for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pre-configured webpack features such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/&quot;&gt;hot module replacement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/&quot;&gt;code-splitting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.jsx&quot;&gt;tree-shaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/webpack/predictable-long-term-caching-with-webpack-d3eee1d3fa31&quot;&gt;efficient long term caching&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-overlay&quot;&gt;error overlays&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ES2017 transpilation (plus common proposals like object rest spread and dynamic import) and usage-based polyfills injection via Babel 7 + &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-env&quot;&gt;preset-env&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for PostCSS (with autoprefixer enabled by default) and all major CSS pre-processors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auto-generated HTML with hashed asset links and preload/prefetch resource hints&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modes and cascading environment variables via .env files&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/browser-compatibility.html#modern-mode&quot;&gt;Modern mode&lt;/a&gt;: ship native ES2017+ bundle and legacy bundle in parallel (details below)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#pages&quot;&gt;Multi-page mode&lt;/a&gt;: build an app with multiple HTML/JS entry points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/build-targets.html#app&quot;&gt;Build targets&lt;/a&gt;: build Vue Single-File Components into a library or native web components (details below)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are many optional integrations that you can mix and match when you create a new project, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-plugin-typescript&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-plugin-pwa&quot;&gt;PWA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://router.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue Router&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuex.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vuex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://palantir.github.io/tslint/&quot;&gt;TSLint&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://prettier.io/&quot;&gt;Prettier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unit Testing via &lt;a href=&quot;https://jestjs.io/&quot;&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://mochajs.org/&quot;&gt;Mocha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;E2E Testing via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cypress.io/&quot;&gt;Cypress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://nightwatchjs.org/&quot;&gt;Nightwatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*llJjroMC2YJWizrXOgCDuA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pick as much or as little as you want.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Vue CLI makes sure all the above features work nicely together so that you don’t have to do the plumbing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Configurable with No Need to Eject&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the features listed above work with zero configuration from your part: when you scaffold a project via Vue CLI 3, it installs the Vue CLI runtime service (@vue/cli-service), selected feature plugins, and generates the necessary config files for you. In most cases, you just need to focus on writing the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, CLI tools that attempt to abstract away underlying dependencies often strip away the ability to fine-tweak the internal configurations for those dependencies —in order to make such changes, the user typically has to “eject”, i.e. checking the raw configurations into the project in order to make changes. The downside of this is that once you eject, you are on your own and won’t be able to upgrade to a newer version of the tool in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We acknowledge the importance of being able to get lower-level access to the configs, but we also don’t want to leave ejected users behind, so we’ve figured out a way for you to tweak almost all aspects of the configurations without ejecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 3rd party integrations like Babel, TypeScript and PostCSS, Vue CLI respects the corresponding configuration files for these tools. For webpack, the user can either leverage &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge&quot;&gt;webpack-merge&lt;/a&gt; to merge simple options into the final config, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/webpack.html#chaining-advanced&quot;&gt;precisely target and tweak existing loaders and plugins via webpack-chain&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Vue CLI ships with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/webpack.html#inspecting-the-project-s-webpack-config&quot;&gt;vue inspect&lt;/a&gt; command to help you inspect the internal webpack configuration. The best part though, is that you don’t need to eject just to make small tweaks — you can still upgrade the CLI service and plugins to receive fixes and new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jiQtvLrGM4MP78tXaEhLRg.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-neutrino/webpack-chain&quot;&gt;webpack-chain&lt;/a&gt; to tweak the options for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin&quot;&gt;html-webpack-plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extensible Plugin System&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want Vue CLI to be a platform the community can built upon, so we designed the new version with a plugin architecture from day one. A Vue CLI 3 plugin can be very powerful: it can inject dependencies and files during the app’s scaffolding phase, and tweak the app’s webpack config or inject additional commands to the CLI service during development. Most of the built-in integrations like TypeScript are implemented as plugins using the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-service/lib/PluginAPI.js&quot;&gt;plugin API&lt;/a&gt; that is available to all community plugins. If you are interested in writing your own plugin, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/dev-guide/plugin-dev.html#service-plugin&quot;&gt;plugin dev guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Vue CLI 3 we no longer have “templates” — instead, you can create your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/plugins-and-presets.html#remote-presets&quot;&gt;remote preset&lt;/a&gt; to share your selection of plugins and options with other developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Graphical User Interface&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the amazing work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/9bafe4e8ffdd&quot;&gt;Guillaume CHAU&lt;/a&gt;, Vue CLI 3 ships with a full-blown GUI that not only can create new projects, but also manage the plugins and tasks inside the projects (yes, it even comes with the fancy webpack dashboard shown below):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gFc-hzoWXxts2VT40pic1Q.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This does not require Electron — just launch it with `vue ui`.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: although Vue CLI 3 is released as stable, the UI is still in beta. Expect a few quirks here and there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Instant Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t fun to wait for npm install before you can write any code. Sometimes we just need that instant access to a working environment to get that spark of inspiration flowing. With Vue CLI 3’s vue serve command, this is all you need to do to start prototyping with Vue single-file components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3eLVIg4G46mc5nEte_tzzA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Instant prototyping with `vue serve`&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prototyping dev server comes with the same setup of a standard app, so you can easily move the prototype*.vue file into a properly scaffolded project’s src folder to continue working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Versatile and Future Ready&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Modern Mode&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Babel we are able to leverage all the newest language features in ES2015+, but that also means we have to ship transpiled and polyfilled bundles in order to support older browsers. These transpiled bundles are often more verbose than the original native ES2015+ code, and also parse and run slower. Given that today a good majority of the modern browsers have decent support for native ES2015+, it is a waste shipping heavier and less efficient code to these browsers just because we have to support older ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue CLI offers a “Modern Mode” to help you solve this problem. When building for production with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;vue-cli-service build --modern&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue CLI will produce two versions of your app: one modern bundle targeting modern browsers that support &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/&quot;&gt;ES modules&lt;/a&gt;, and one legacy bundle targeting older browsers that do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cool part though is that there are no special deployment requirements. The generated HTML file automatically employs the techniques discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/&quot;&gt;Phillip Walton’s excellent post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The modern bundle is loaded with &amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&amp;gt;, in browsers that support it; they are also preloaded using &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;modulepreload&amp;quot;&amp;gt; instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The legacy bundle is loaded with &amp;lt;script nomodule&amp;gt;, which is ignored by browsers that support ES modules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fix for &amp;lt;script nomodule&amp;gt; in Safari 10 is also automatically injected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a Hello World app, the modern bundle is already 16% smaller. In production, the modern bundle will typically result in significantly faster parsing and evaluation, improving your app’s loading performance. The best part? All it needs from you is a --modern command line flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The reason we are not making modern mode the default is the longer build time and some extra config needed if you are working with CORS / CSP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Building as Web Components&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can build any *.vue component in a Vue CLI 3 project into a web component with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;vue-cli-service build --target wc --name my-element src/MyComponent.vue&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will generate a JavaScript bundle that wraps and registers the internal Vue component as a native custom element on the page, which can then be used simply as &amp;lt;my-element&amp;gt;. The consuming page does need to include Vue on the page as a global, but other than that, Vue is completely hidden as an implementation detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can even build multiple *.vue components into a code-split bundle with multiple chunks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;vue-cli-service build --target wc-async &amp;#39;src/components/*.vue&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;By including a small entry file from the resulting bundle, it registers all components as native custom elements, but only fetches the code for the underlying Vue component when the corresponding custom element is first instantiated on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Vue CLI 3, the same codebase can be used to build an app, a UMD library, or native web components. You get to enjoy the same Vue development experience no matter what targets you are building towards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Try It Out Today!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue CLI 3 is now ready to serve as the standard build tool behind Vue applications, but this is just the beginning. As mentioned, a longer-term goal for Vue CLI is to incorporate best practices from both the present and the future into the toolchain. We hope that as the web platform evolves, Vue CLI can keep helping its users ship performant apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try it out right now by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html&quot;&gt;following the instruction from the docs&lt;/a&gt;. We can’t wait to see what you build with it. Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c42bebe28fbb&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-cli-3-0-is-here-c42bebe28fbb&quot;&gt;Vue CLI 3.0 is here!&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some of you might have already found out, but today it’s official — we are excited to announce the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vuejs.org&quot;&gt;Vue.js News&lt;/a&gt; platform. With such a rapidly growing ecosystem around Vue it is becoming more challenging to stay up to date with all that’s happening. That’s why we aim to provide a reliable way to all the important news for Vue.js developers like you. Right from the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news platform consists of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weekly Newsletter (previously known as Vue.js Newsletter)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;News Podcast covering the highlights from the newsletter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; where you can read and listen to all of the above&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XdYh6S39pHhmPMKfxmPOug.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How it all started&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One and a half year ago, some time in July, I got together with &lt;strong&gt;Krzysztof Jung&lt;/strong&gt; and we came up with the idea for the Vue.js Newsletter. I think it was the first Vue related newsletter ever. It turned out to be an incredibly popular idea. To the point we had to turn off the new subscriber notifications as the emails flooded our mailboxes in the first several minutes after announcing the newsletter. A few days later, on July 20th, we sent the very first issue to first 759 subscribers. Today we have sent the 80th weekly issue and our subscriber base already passed 7000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a subscriber yet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vuejs.org/subscribe&quot;&gt;subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More than just a Newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Vue.js Newsletter project started as side-project for Krzysztof and me while working at &lt;strong&gt;Monterail&lt;/strong&gt;, thanks to the generous donation from Monterail, the newsletter has since become the official news channel for the Vue.js organisation. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, what’s more interesting is that it won’t be just a newsletter anymore thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Gregg Pollack&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Adam Jahr&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Vue Mastery&lt;/strong&gt; team. Due to their involvement, each newsletter issue will be additionally covered in the form of a weekly podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you will be to get the news the way you like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can already subscribe to the podcast on: &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-official-vue-news/id1329151772&quot;&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://subscribeonandroid.com/vuenews.fireside.fm/rss&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/code-pop/the-official-vue-news&quot;&gt;Stitcher&lt;/a&gt; or simply using &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuenews.fireside.fm/rss&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get involved&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, even we won’t be able to discover all the new, great stuff you all create each week. That’s why we ask for your help! Get involved in gathering the most useful stories. Just go to the online form found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vuejs.org/submit&quot;&gt;submit page&lt;/a&gt; and submit your story, library or news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, and feel free to follow us on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VueNewsletter&quot;&gt;@VueNewsletter&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;br&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_kTv9_CpXugN6JqIYsyEwQ.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f38e124bbee8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-js-news-announcement-f38e124bbee8&quot;&gt;Vue.js News Announcement&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A big update was released to the Vue devtools just a few days ago. Let’s dive into the new features and improvements! 🎄&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Editable component data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now modify the data of your component directly in the Component inspector pane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select a component&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under the data section in the inspector, mouse over a field&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the pencil icon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Submit your changes by clicking on the done icon or by hitting Enter. You can hit Escape to cancel the edition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FxeBRtXLrQYA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxeBRtXLrQYA&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FxeBRtXLrQYA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/f7c56357d7d8b9c1bf19a99a25d23e4f/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/f7c56357d7d8b9c1bf19a99a25d23e4f/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content of the field is the serialized JSON value. For example, if you want to enter a string, type &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; with the double-quotes. An array should look like [1, 2, &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;] and an object like { &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot; } .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the values of following types can be edited:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;null and undefined&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;String&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Literal: Boolean , Number , Infinity , -Infinity and NaN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arrays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plain objects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Arrays and Plain objects, you can add and remove items using the dedicated icons. You can also rename object keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Ffx1zjvHryJ0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dfx1zjvHryJ0&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Ffx1zjvHryJ0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/media/d543bdf5d6f0d6e86bf6b08ac70bec24/href&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/media/d543bdf5d6f0d6e86bf6b08ac70bec24/href&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warning will be displayed if the input isn’t valid JSON.

You can also install it &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd&quot;&gt;on Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/&quot;&gt;on Firefox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for all the contributors that helped make this big update possible!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find an issue or have a new feature to suggest, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://new-issue.vuejs.org/?repo=vuejs/vue-devtools&quot;&gt;share it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new release should arrive pretty soon with even more features like selecting a component in the page (color picker-style) and some UI improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have a few things in the works, like a standalone Vue devtools app that will allow debugging any environment (not just Chrome and Firefox), a brand new Routing tab and an improved support for Set and Map types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9361e75e05d0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/whats-new-in-vue-devtools-4-0-9361e75e05d0&quot;&gt;What’s new in Vue Devtools 4.0&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Vue 2.5 released</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2017 21:47:39 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce the release of Vue 2.5 Level E! This release includes improvements of various features and we recommend checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/releases/tag/v2.5.0&quot;&gt;release note&lt;/a&gt; for full details. In this post we are going to highlight some of the more prominent changes: better TypeScript integration, better error handling, better support for functional components in single-file components, and environment-agnostic server-side rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Better TypeScript Integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vB-z-t961mJnd4a6re02Iw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help from the TypeScript team, 2.5 offers greatly improved type declarations that works with Vue’s out-of-the-box API without the need for a component class decorator. The new type declarations also power editor extensions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur&quot;&gt;Vetur&lt;/a&gt;, enabling better Intellisense support for plain JavaScript users as well. For more details, checkout our &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/upcoming-typescript-changes-in-vue-2-5-e9bd7e2ecf08&quot;&gt;earlier post regarding the changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shoutout to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielrosenwasser&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel Rosenwasser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; from the TypeScript team for starting the PR, and to core team members &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herrington Darkholme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ktsn&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katashin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for improving and reviewing the changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: TypeScript users should also update the following packages to the latest version for type declaration compatibility: vue-router, vuex, vuex-router-sync and vue-class-component.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Better Error Handling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*ZHamhzmnoQcQTxCJE3cmvA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2.4 and earlier versions, we typical use the global config.errorHandler option for handling unexpected errors in our applications. We also have the renderError component option for handling errors in render functions. However, we lack a mechanism for handling generic errors inside a specific part of the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2.5 we have introduced the new errorCaptured hook. A component with this hook captures all errors (excluding those fired in async callbacks) from its child component tree (excluding itself). If you are familiar with React, this is similar to the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html#introducing-error-boundaries&quot;&gt;Error Boundaries&lt;/a&gt; introduced in React 16. The hook receives the same arguments as the global `errorHandler`, and you can leverage this hook to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/yyx990803/9bdff05e5468a60ced06c29c39114c6b#error-handling-with-errorcaptured-hook&quot;&gt;gracefully handle and display the error&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Better Support for Functional Components in SFCs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jg9qGPkPadGBEa-KUPrMpA.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vue-loader &amp;gt;= 13.3.0 and Vue 2.5, functional components defined as a Single-File Component in a *.vue file now enjoys proper &lt;a href=&quot;https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/functional.html&quot;&gt;template compilation, Scoped CSS and hot-reloading support&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it much easier to convert leaf-components into functional ones for performance optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shoutout to core team member &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blake-newman&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blake Newman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for his contribution to these features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Environment Agnostic SSR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default build of `vue-server-renderer` assumes a Node.js environment, which makes it unusable in alternative JavaScript runtimes such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/phpv8/v8js&quot;&gt;php-v8js&lt;/a&gt; or Nashorn. In 2.5 we have shipped &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/packages/vue-server-renderer/basic.js&quot;&gt;a build of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/packages/vue-server-renderer/basic.js&quot;&gt;vue-server-renderer that is environment-agnostic&lt;/a&gt; which can be used in the browser or in pure JavaScript engines. This could open up interesting strategies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/yyx990803/9bdff05e5468a60ced06c29c39114c6b#environment-agnostic-ssr&quot;&gt;utilizing Vue server-rendering directly in your php process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, we recommend checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/releases/tag/v2.5.0&quot;&gt;full release note&lt;/a&gt; for improvements in other APIs, including v-on, v-model, scoped slots, provide/inject and more. You might also be interested in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/roadmap&quot;&gt;public roadmap&lt;/a&gt; detailing what the team is working on. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=14bd65bf030b&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-5-released-14bd65bf030b&quot;&gt;Vue 2.5 released&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Typing Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been receiving requests for better TypeScript integration ever since the release of Vue 2.0. Since the release, we have included official TypeScript type declarations for most of the core libraries (vue, vue-router, vuex). However, the current integration is somewhat lacking when using the out-of-the-box Vue API. For example, TypeScript cannot easily infer the type of this inside the default object-based API that Vue uses. To make our Vue code play nicely with TypeScript, we have to use the&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component&quot;&gt;vue-class-component&lt;/a&gt; decorator, which allows us to author Vue components using a class-based syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For users that preferred a class-based API, this was probably good enough, but it was a bit unfortunate that users had to use a different API just for the sake of type inference. This also made migrating existing Vue codebases to TypeScript more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, TypeScript introduced a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/14141&quot;&gt;new features&lt;/a&gt; that makes it possible to improve Vue’s type declarations so that TypeScript can better understand the object literal based API. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DanielRosenwasser&quot;&gt;Daniel Rosenwasser&lt;/a&gt; from the TypeScript team started an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5887&quot;&gt;ambitious PR&lt;/a&gt; (now being maintained &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6391&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by core team member &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme&quot;&gt;HerringtonDarkholme&lt;/a&gt;) which, once merged, will provide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper type inference for this when using the default Vue API. It also works inside single-file components!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type inference for props on this based on the component’s propsoption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;these improvements also benefit plain JavaScript users!&lt;/strong&gt; If you are using VSCode with the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vetur&quot;&gt;Vetur&lt;/a&gt; extension, you will get greatly improved autocompletion suggestions and even type hints when using plain JavaScript in Vue components! This is because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-language-server&quot;&gt;vue-language-server&lt;/a&gt;, the internal package that is responsible for analyzing Vue components, can take advantage of the TypeScript compiler to extract more information about your code. Moreover, any editor that supports the language server protocol can leverage &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/tree/master/server&quot;&gt;vue-language-server&lt;/a&gt; to provide similar features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ftKUpzYGIzn1eS87JcBS8Q.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;VSCode + Vetur + New Type Declarations in Action&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are curious, you can try it out today by cloning &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/octref/veturpack/tree/new-types&quot;&gt;this playground project&lt;/a&gt; (make sure to checkout the new-types branch) and opening it with VSCode + Vetur!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Potential Required Actions for TypeScript Users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typing upgrade will be shipped in Vue 2.5, currently planned to be released around early October. We are releasing it in a minor release because the JavaScript public API is not getting any breaking changes, however, the upgrade does potentially require some actions for existing TypeScript+Vue users. This is why we are announcing the changes now so that you can have enough time to plan for the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new typings require a minimum of TypeScript 2.4, and it’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of TypeScript along with Vue 2.5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Previously, we already recommend using ES-style imports (import Vue from ‘vue’) everywhere with “allowSyntheticDefaultImports”: true in tsconfig.json. The new typings will officially move to ES-style import/export syntax, so that config is no longer necessary, and users are required to use ES-style imports in all cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To accompany the export syntax change, the following core libraries that have typings relying on Vue core typing will receive new major versions, and should be upgraded along with Vue core 2.5: vuex, vue-router, vuex-router-sync, vue-class-component.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When performing custom module augmentations, the user should now use interface VueConstructor instead of namespace Vue. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6391/files#diff-1c3e3e4cf681d5fde88941717da1058aL11&quot;&gt;example diff&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ThisType of computed, watch, render and lifecycle hooks will need manual type annotations if you annotate your component options with as ComponentOptions&amp;lt;Something&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have tried our best to minimize required upgrading efforts and these type improvements are compatible with the class-based API used in vue-class-component. For most users, simply upgrading the dependencies and switching to ES-style imports should be all it takes. In the meanwhile, we also recommend locking your Vue version to 2.4.x until you are ready to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On the Roadmap: TypeScript Support in vue-cli&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 2.5, we are planning to introduce official support for TypeScript in the next version of vue-cli in order to make it easier for TS+Vue users to kick off new projects. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;For non-TypeScript users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes do not affect non-TypeScript Vue users in any negative way; per semver, 2.5 will be fully backwards compatible in terms of public JavaScript API, and the TypeScript CLI integration will be completely opt-in. But as mentioned above, you will likely notice better auto-completion suggestions if you are using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/tree/master/server&quot;&gt;vue-language-server&lt;/a&gt; powered editor extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielrosenwasser&quot;&gt;Daniel Rosenwasser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme&quot;&gt;HerringtonDarkholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ktsn&quot;&gt;Katashin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/octref&quot;&gt;Pine Wu&lt;/a&gt; for working on these features and reviewing this post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e9bd7e2ecf08&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/upcoming-typescript-changes-in-vue-2-5-e9bd7e2ecf08&quot;&gt;Upcoming TypeScript Changes in Vue 2.5&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 20:10:12 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today we are happy to announce that we have started to accept financial contributions to the Vue project via &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/vuejs&quot;&gt;OpenCollective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WT87J0dX9D8kyQgxGPx5Vw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why OpenCollective?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question many will probably ask is “why OpenCollective when you already have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/evanyou&quot;&gt;successful Patreon campaign&lt;/a&gt;?” — there are a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I started the Patreon campaign, the primary goal was providing myself with enough income so that I can work on Vue full-time. Today, as the Vue community grows, there are more and more contributions from the community, and OpenCollective’s transparent expense model could help us scale the financial contributions beyond a single developer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenCollective is also a platform built with open source projects in mind. It has done a really great job engaging with the open source community, so sponsors also benefit from better community exposure. It’s very encouraging to see projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/webpack&quot;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt; thriving on OpenCollective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It also provides nice technical features such as GitHub integration, automating backers listing, and invoice generation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What About Patreon?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary difference between our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/evanyou&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/vuejs&quot;&gt;OpenCollective&lt;/a&gt; campaigns are that the funds donated via Patreon goes directly to support my full-time effort on Vue — so it is still critically important. The Patreon campaign will continue to accept donations and all current backer/sponsor perks will remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, funds donated to OpenCollective will be managed with transparent expenses — this allows us to use these funds to support major undertakings by core contributors, and sponsor community events such as meetups or even conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter whether you are a freelancer or a company building core products using Vue, no matter which platform you choose, one thing is certain: your contributions will help keep Vue sustainable and make it better in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/vuejs&quot;&gt;Support Vue on OpenCollective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/evanyou&quot;&gt;Support Vue on Patreon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1ef89ca1334b&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-is-now-on-opencollective-1ef89ca1334b&quot;&gt;Vue is now on OpenCollective!&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Vue in 2016</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZJD3llCWveVH9-uUcCjMCw.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;…and we thought 2015 was an explosive year!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s already end of 2016! During the past 12 months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt;’s growth has been consistently exceeding my expectations — the project has grown from a relatively niche framework to one that is now often compared to the biggest players in the field. Let’s take a look at what happened!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2016 Stats Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;NPM downloads: 1,943,567 total, 1,531,217 YTD (up from 382,184 in 2015, +300%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core repo GitHub stars: 37,664 total, ~26,000 YTD (up from ~7,600 in 2015, +240%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core repo Pull Requests merged: 350 total, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20merged%3A2016-01-01..2016-12-31%20&quot;&gt;258 YTD&lt;/a&gt; (up from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20merged%3A2015-01-01..2015-12-31%20&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, +268%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vuejs.org page views: 21,424,759 YTD (up from 3,761,728 in 2015, +470%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vuejs.org monthly active users: 358,405 (up from 77,836 in 2015, + 360%) &lt;em&gt;Side note: 42% of user sessions are from China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chrome DevTools extension weekly active users: 84,098 (no prior year stats)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trivia: Vue is now the 10th most starred JavaScript project on GitHub, and is the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11bGpZq6ixlhrmQnzEUqbgbwTQwQVdtvILjp32vaOKBc/edit#gid=1735042899&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;3rd most starred among all projects in 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (1st if excluding non-source-code projects).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is It Just Hype?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We certainly hope not. Vue has been around for almost 3 years now, and the growth curve has been quite consistent over the past two. We have received many positive feedback from happy in-production users, and there had been at least two HN-front-page articles this year written by Vue users detailing their positive experience with Vue. That said, Vue is not, and does not intend to be “&lt;em&gt;the next shiny thing you should switch to ASAP&lt;/em&gt;” — its design goal is not about revolutionizing UI development paradigms; rather, it’s about enabling more people to build for the web. Vue takes inspirations from many other excellent frameworks, but aims to combine and expose these ideas in an approachable and progressive fashion so that more developers could benefit from them. So, don’t feel obliged to switch to it just because it’s trending — but do try it out to see if it makes you a happier developer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Going Independent&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early March I decided to work on Vue full-time independently and started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/evanyou&quot;&gt;Patreon campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which has been (to my surprise) quite successful so far. It is my first time working independently without having to report to a manager, and it has been a very liberating experience. The good part is that work no longer feels like work: I don’t really have to force myself to do work because what I need to do is also what I genuinely want to do, plus I have full control over how and when to work. On the other hand, it is also the bad part: it becomes quite difficult to manage the balance between life and work, especially while being a new parent (yes I had a baby this year too!). This is something I’m learning to cope with and hopefully will get better at next year. But overall, I feel that I am more motivated and fulfilled than ever before, and I’d like to express my gratitude to all the Patreon backers and sponsors for making all this possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Launching 2.0&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work on 2.0 was a big undertaking — I had been thinking about it for a long time, but only started the effort thanks to the full-time switch. The entire project was rewritten from the ground up to take advantage of completely different compilation/rendering strategies — but at the same time it had to preserve the same development experience and a largely similar API with the previous version. This also meant that we had to upgrade the surrounding ecosystem of vue-router, vuex and the build toolchain to work with the new core, plus updating the documentation for all of them. It turned out to be much more work than I anticipated: I started the first prototype of Vue 2.0 in early April, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-2-0-is-here-ef1f26acf4b8#.2ptwit6jz&quot;&gt;official launch&lt;/a&gt; was on Sep. 30th, after almost 6 months! The new release made Vue leaner, faster and more powerful with the new features and cross-environment capabilities. Looking back, I’m really proud of the work we’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beyond a Personal Project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scope of Vue-related projects expanded, I was fortunate enough to be joined by many awesome contributors from the community. Today, many &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/vuejs/people&quot;&gt;core team&lt;/a&gt; members are actively contributing to all aspects of the project, from core features like server-side rendering to sub-projects like the documentation (vuejs.org), vue-router, vuex and official TypeScript integrations. I have been constantly humbled by their enthusiasm and dedication to open source work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the same appreciation goes to all other community contributors for participating in design discussions, proposing new features, triaging issues, and submitting bug fixes. We are getting more and more PRs (258 this year in the core repo alone!), with quite a few of them bringing substantial improvements to the codebase. It is the combination of everyone involved that is making the Vue ecosystem better day by day. This project wouldn’t be where it’s at now without your contributions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still many aspects that can be improved about Vue. Here’s what’s on our list for 2017:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Improving the Test Story&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the feedback on Twitter, many users feel that there isn’t enough information on testing Vue components and applications. This is an area we will definitely focus on improving — both by providing more guidance in the docs, and also by providing official testing utilities that makes it easier to test Vue components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Polishing the Dev Experience&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to further polish the dev experience across the stack: better in-development tips and warnings, better server-side rendering (SSR) stack traces, performance profiling in DevTools, and better CLI templates that make it easier to use SSR or build PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Better Discoverability for the Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vue ecosystem has been growing rapidly, but as a result &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue&quot;&gt;awesome-vue&lt;/a&gt; has become bloated and very difficult to navigate and evaluate. The team has been thinking hard about this and we are working on a project to help users identify high-quality community projects: it will be curated with a higher standard and will provide much more detailed information for each project included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Native Rendering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaboration with Alibaba’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://weex-project.io/&quot;&gt;Weex project&lt;/a&gt; has made some substantial progress. Our first major goal — making Vue 2 the actual JavaScript runtime framework on top of Weex’s native rendering engine — has been completed in the latest 0.9.4 release. In 2017 there will be revamped documentations, better onboarding experience and API improvements based on feedback from the community and large-scale production use at Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Emerging Web Platform Features&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new standards emerge and get implemented, we are keeping a close eye on ones that can potentially bring significant improvements to Vue. For example, it’s possible to leverage &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy&quot;&gt;ES2015 Proxy&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate some of the current limitations of Vue’s reactivity system. We are also exploring the possibility of compiling and distributing Vue components as native Custom Elements. Right now, the biggest blocker is browser compatibility — to ensure consistent behavior in all supported browsers, it’s unlikely for us to prioritize these features until the support ratio reaches a significant majority. But rest assured that we are aware of these emerging standards and already experimenting. When the time is ready, Vue will swiftly evolve to leverage these new platform capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;By the Way: We Are Having a Conference in 2017!&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still in early planning stages, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://conf.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;visit the site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiRF9JIpvAcWL7EsnpODIhf_JiNX3PETA_S3XnqmtuG2foQA/viewform&quot;&gt;take the survey&lt;/a&gt; to help us make it a great event. Better yet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtbxBpV0j_zCnELXQuIkeGH8x6gaOWE0J8tTsAdpa0O5MYOw/viewform&quot;&gt;submit a talk&lt;/a&gt; to share your knowledge and experience with fellow Vue users!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are interested in Vue, checkout the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;official site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get started, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vuejs&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8df71d98bfb3&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-in-2016-8df71d98bfb3&quot;&gt;Vue in 2016&lt;/a&gt; was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-vue-point&quot;&gt;The Vue Point&lt;/a&gt; on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
