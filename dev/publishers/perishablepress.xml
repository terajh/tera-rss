      <content:encoded>There are many ways to do this. I wanted the quickest and easiest. I run Yourls on several sites to create shortlinks for my books. Each instance of Yourls contains many URLs. I like to keep my books current. URLs tend to change and break over time. It is a chore to check 800+ links in each of my books, page after page. So I wanted a quick way to check for 404 and other broken links. In this post, [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Here is a simple blank (empty) .htaccess file, ready for download. 👉 Read notes below. Why? Because .htaccess files by default are hidden on most systems. In some cases it is easier to simply download a blank copy instead of trying to create one manually. As someone who works a lot with Apache/.htaccess, it&amp;#8217;s nice to have a &amp;#8220;go-to&amp;#8221; place for downloading and sharing a blank/empty .htaccess file. Notes The download is a tiny (376 bytes) ZIP file Unzip the [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>For years, I thought of Google as a trustworthy helper on the Web. Especially where it mattered most, removing pirated copies of my books from Google search results. After publishing a new book, I would monitor the search results and file a DMCA notice with Google whenever the inevitable pirated copies of my book were listed. Google always was very helpful in this regard, swiftly removing any pirated books asap. No hassle, no hoops, just immediate and direct relief from [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>For those who know, YOURLS makes it super easy to host your own URL shortening service. I use Yourls on several sites and it works great at generating shortlinks for otherwise long and tedious URLs. So they&amp;#8217;re easier to share, remember, social media, etc. Yourls is developed by a well-respected developer and is 100% FREE and open source for everyone. It&amp;#8217;s a truly great app and highly recommended. Related: Learn how to check for 404 and other broken or redirected [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>One of my new year&amp;#8217;s resolutions is to learn AI more deeply. Although I&amp;#8217;ve kept up with how things are changing in the AI/LLM world, I actually use AI very rarely. It&amp;#8217;s just not necessary for anything that I do. And before you say, &amp;#8220;well then you must not do anything&amp;#8221;, I should mention that my online books, scripts, and plugins enjoy well over one million active users. It&amp;#8217;s a LOT of responsibility and work. And because I am a [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>For several years, Apple Mail would specify the wrong name for the &amp;#8220;To&amp;#8221; field when sending email messages. It was very frustrating and confusing for numerous reasons. Whatever I tried to resolve the issue, nothing seemed to work. So for years using Apple Mail, which for the most part works very well, I was stuck sending messages that specified incorrect names for the &amp;#8220;To&amp;#8221; field. Well praise the Lord, today I found a simple solution that finally resolves the issue. [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I like to read. All sorts of stuff. Especially social media posts. I can sit for hours scrolling thru threads, but it gets annoying when there is someone spamming or pushing an agenda, or just being stupid in general. So I looked back my notes and remembered that most browsers can be customized with user-defined stylesheets. This tutorial explains an easy way to use your own custom CSS to block unwanted content on any website. It works without requiring logging [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
