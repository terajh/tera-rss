      <content:encoded>I’ve been designing websites for 20 years and recently I have designed plenty of stuff for clubs and for my magazine, and honestly the same design rules apply for both. Good photos, clear text, decent colours and plenty of space. Get those right and you’re halfway there. Images Football photos are always full of colour [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>First blog post of the new year and it’s almost April so my bad. Today I am writing about portfolios and CVs as I have spent the last few months going over so many as we look to expand our design team at the agency. Whilst going through them all, you start to see similar [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>A year ago, a book changed my life. The book itself was not out yet but I was lucky enough to know the author and over time was able to see first hand what was going into it. The author was Andy Clarke and the book was Art Direction For The Web. It was around [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>As a designer and developer, I always want to push forward new ideas and ways of thinking about design for the web and eCommerce. It’s often put to me that a lot of eCommerce stores look the same and could in essence be selling anything as is the nature of how it looks and more [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about documenting my workflow for some time so here is a breakdown of how I tend to work these days at the agency. Not every project runs the same and might have more stages or less but this is a rough idea of how it all works. Discovery As a designer, I [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <title>The importance of prototyping</title>

      <content:encoded>They say a picture tells 1000 words. Well a prototype answers over 1000 questions. I have prototyped for years whether the project needed it or not. Most if not all my work is done in CSS and HTML with a smattering of jQuery. Responsive web design has kind of forced it on to us in [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>First off, I never planned to write a blog post about AI but today I used it for something that improved my designs a lot. A few days back, I posted a link to a website that had hit social and was getting a lot of attention. I think it’s a lovely well considered bit [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I was thinking back to the old days of a time where I spent a great deal of time creating a design and building it with so much love and care, thinking of every detail and not being scared to try out new ideas.

      <content:encoded>For the past few months, I have been helping my lad with his data analyst role that he’s volunteering to do for our local team. Armed with a VEO camera, a spreadsheet and a good nights sleep after a match, we have been building up a ton of data on the team and opposition which [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I live in a small town in North Wales. They have a football team and for years, I have always toyed with going to watch them. I remember playing on the pitch at the ground with school and local teams as a child but I guess once I saw the bigger stadiums in the English [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>2025 has rolled in and I&amp;#8217;ve been busy. Over Christmas I got the design bug and started to design some football info graphics and I got thinking about producing a monthly update which spiralled into a full on magazine. Long story short, I&amp;#8217;ve bought a domain and Top Bins magazine is now my evenings and [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I’ve spoken about mental health in the past including my own. I’m quite open about the struggles and the tools I use. Every day is different and the mental health is no different, some days are good, some not so but the bit I find worrying is that aside from the individual themselves, nobody would [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
