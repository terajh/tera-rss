      <content:encoded>If your users scale the text size in Android or iDeviceOS, that doesn&amp;#8217;t always affect the size of text on a web page. It&amp;#8217;s a function of browser and authored code, as opposed to a standardized approach. That may be changing. Support The current state of affairs in the three&amp;#8230;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>This is an unplanned part two for Barriers from Links with ARIA. The title reflects my exasperation because this isn&amp;#8217;t new, I&amp;#8217;ve simply failed to be explicit about it over the last decade or so. In 2012 I vented about TypeButter using &amp;#60;kern style=&quot;letter-spacing: -0.01em;&quot;&amp;#62; for each letter. In 2020&amp;#8230;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Today Temani Afif asked a question: Are the below codes equivalent if we consider all the aspects? (a11y, semantic, something else maybe?)

      <content:encoded>This post does not discuss whether live regions are good, nor is it a post about the best way to use them. This post only covers how they are exposed to the audience who experiences them — screen reader users. Written by a non-screen-reader user.

      <title>Brief Note on Application Keyboard Shortcuts</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 18:45:04 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Identifying keyboard shortcuts for an application is mostly an internationalization problem. It&amp;#8217;s also not a new problem. A recent (to me) example is the WordPress Gutenberg team starting to discuss keyboard shortcuts in 2017, addressing what will and won&amp;#8217;t work across keyboards for different languages.

      <title>How I Evaluate an ACR (VPAT®)</title>

      <content:encoded>ACRs are Accessibility Conformance Reports, which are the output of a VPAT, or Voluntary Product Accessibility Template maintained by ITIC, or the Information Technology Industry Council (which is why VPAT often has a &amp;#174; symbol hanging off it). An organization may fill out the template to indicate how or if&amp;#8230;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I&amp;#8217;m using this post to acknowledge my past practices and establish future ones on this site related to ‘AI’. I have not, and will not, use LLMs to write, draft, review, or otherwise participate in content creation — outside of clearly-identified contexts to critique it. I have used generative technologies&amp;#8230;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>This post&amp;#8217;s title is unpleasant, but it&amp;#8217;s important to acknowledge the reality of the human condition and limitations in technologies. Even purpose-built assistive tech. Broadly, when someone says something is &amp;#8220;accessible&amp;#8221; that&amp;#8217;s a hopeful statement that is based on some best efforts. Of course, there are bad actors who assert&amp;#8230;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>This is meant to use voice control to test select menus (and other fields, but the title would be less weird) by their value because their accessible names are hidden. I&amp;#8217;m sharing results of that testing. This was partially driven by: WCAG issue #3808 SC 3.3.2: Labels or Instructions and&amp;#8230;</content:encoded>
