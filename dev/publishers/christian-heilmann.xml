      <content:encoded>Quick segue here, but this story is too good. In 1942, Die Grosse Liebe came out, Goebbel&amp;#8217;s Magnum Opus other than Triumph of the Will. The Nazi propaganda minister was really into this movie and wanted it to be a huge success swaying the emotions of the German people back to believe in winning the [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>In the 13th century Cistercian monks came up with a way to show the numbers from 1 to 9999 as a single character. The way it works is to add the lines of different characters to each other until the number is reached. So, if you want to show 161, you take the 1, the [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Lately, I have found an incredibly annoying pattern in social media&amp;#8212;especially LinkedIn posts: the &amp;#8220;you are already behind&amp;#8221; posts, claiming that by not using product $XYZ you have already been beaten by the competition. These incendiary headlines are often followed up by a testimonial that the author used $XYZ to deliver 10-23x the amount of [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I&amp;#8217;ve stated on several occasions that Lego made me a developer. I was the youngest of four kids who inherited a huge box of bricks with no instruction booklets. So I took lots of smaller bits to build bigger things and re-used skills and ways to connect things. I came up with my own models [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
