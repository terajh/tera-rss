The idea is that you can use some HTML attributes on a form or register JavaScript tool methods to give agents direct access to content. This gives us as content providers and web developers an active way to point agents [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Quick segue here, but this story is too good. In 1942, Die Grosse Liebe came out, Goebbel&amp;#8217;s Magnum Opus other than Triumph of the Will. The Nazi propaganda minister was really into this movie and wanted it to be a huge success swaying the emotions of the German people back to believe in winning the [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>In the 13th century Cistercian monks came up with a way to show the numbers from 1 to 9999 as a single character. The way it works is to add the lines of different characters to each other until the number is reached. So, if you want to show 161, you take the 1, the [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
