      <content:encoded>All the big browser makers (and Igalia, a major contributor) dropped their timed blog posts announcing Interop 2026. I&amp;#8217;ll link to Apple&amp;#8217;s because I like how they used column-width on the feature list and I&amp;#8217;m stealing that (in case you see this post directly). I&amp;#8217;m a fan of all of it but of course I&amp;#8217;m [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Generics, combined with conditional types can make for an incredibly powerful combination. When you look at things the right way, you can ask very useful questions about your types that allow you to build the precise API you want.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>The GOAT JavaScript library jQuery has gone 4.0 coinciding with, from what I hear, was a lovely reunion party. It&amp;#8217;s not wildly different, but it&amp;#8217;s gone full ESM and dropped a bunch of old stuff. Minified and gzipped it&amp;#8217;s 27.6 kB. Version 3.7.1, the last before this release, was 30.5 kB — so it&amp;#8217;s nice [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I ran across this website Very Good Components the other day and thought it was a neat idea to have a design gallery that wasn&amp;#8217;t whole websites but individual components. They actually went a bit further and have configurable code for them. Here&amp;#8217;s a Glowing Gradient Divider. I decided to remake it as an &amp;#60;hr&gt; [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>My go-to local app image optimizer has long been ImageOptim. It&amp;#8217;s Mac-only (and free), but they suggest alternatives for other platforms. I reach for ImageOptim usually when I want to optimize a whole bunch of images in a batch. For one-offs, you can&amp;#8217;t do much better than Squoosh, a great progressive web app (PWA).

      <content:encoded>Putting a YouTube video inside a closed details element means it won&apos;t load until that details element is opened. We can use that.</content:encoded>
