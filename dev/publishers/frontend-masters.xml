      <content:encoded>From Nicholas C. Zakas&amp;#8217;s regularly interesting newsletter: The best way to work with legacy code is to approach it patiently—understand small parts, write tests, and document what you learn. My favorite line about legacy code, which I&amp;#8217;ve probably shared too much, is when David Khourshid called it &amp;#8220;Legendary Code&amp;#8221;. Legacy code feels a smidge mean [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>You can capture scrolling events and do your own work with the information in them. It can do cool things, but you&apos;ve got work to do.</content:encoded>

      <title>Death to Scroll Fade!</title>

      <content:encoded>David Bushell is very sick of the &amp;#8220;scroll fade&amp;#8221; effect. It&amp;#8217;s the effect where, as you scroll down a page, elements slide into place. Often, all the elements. I agree it&amp;#8217;s overplayed since it&amp;#8217;s usually movement for the sake of it, not adding anything to the experience. It&amp;#8217;s true that movement catches our eye, but [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <title>Replicating a Switch Input (and Polyfill)</title>

      <content:encoded>Safari has support for &amp;#60;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; switch&gt; where a normal ☑️ checkbox turns into a toggle. You don&amp;#8217;t strictly need the browser support to get the look, as it&amp;#8217;s weirdly easy to replicate (based on idea from Richard Keizer). But Thomas Steiner has a more comprehensive polyfill if you want it to behave more exactly [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Turns out `anchor-scope` is pretty darn useful for button/menu setups that will appear multiple times on the same page.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>All the big browser makers (and Igalia, a major contributor) dropped their timed blog posts announcing Interop 2026. I&amp;#8217;ll link to Apple&amp;#8217;s because I like how they used column-width on the feature list and I&amp;#8217;m stealing that (in case you see this post directly). I&amp;#8217;m a fan of all of it but of course I&amp;#8217;m [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <title>Fun with TypeScript Generics</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 17:00:13 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Generics, combined with conditional types can make for an incredibly powerful combination. When you look at things the right way, you can ask very useful questions about your types that allow you to build the precise API you want.</content:encoded>
