      <content:encoded>Safari has support for &amp;#60;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; switch&gt; where a normal ☑️ checkbox turns into a toggle. You don&amp;#8217;t strictly need the browser support to get the look, as it&amp;#8217;s weirdly easy to replicate (based on idea from Richard Keizer). But Thomas Steiner has a more comprehensive polyfill if you want it to behave more exactly [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Turns out `anchor-scope` is pretty darn useful for button/menu setups that will appear multiple times on the same page.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>All the big browser makers (and Igalia, a major contributor) dropped their timed blog posts announcing Interop 2026. I&amp;#8217;ll link to Apple&amp;#8217;s because I like how they used column-width on the feature list and I&amp;#8217;m stealing that (in case you see this post directly). I&amp;#8217;m a fan of all of it but of course I&amp;#8217;m [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Generics, combined with conditional types can make for an incredibly powerful combination. When you look at things the right way, you can ask very useful questions about your types that allow you to build the precise API you want.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>The GOAT JavaScript library jQuery has gone 4.0 coinciding with, from what I hear, was a lovely reunion party. It&amp;#8217;s not wildly different, but it&amp;#8217;s gone full ESM and dropped a bunch of old stuff. Minified and gzipped it&amp;#8217;s 27.6 kB. Version 3.7.1, the last before this release, was 30.5 kB — so it&amp;#8217;s nice [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I ran across this website Very Good Components the other day and thought it was a neat idea to have a design gallery that wasn&amp;#8217;t whole websites but individual components. They actually went a bit further and have configurable code for them. Here&amp;#8217;s a Glowing Gradient Divider. I decided to remake it as an &amp;#60;hr&gt; [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>You might need to know this someday: you can style a div, put the div into SVG, then put the SVG in to CSS and use it as a repeating background.</content:encoded>
