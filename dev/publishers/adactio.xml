        &lt;p&gt;Not long now ’till &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/&quot;&gt;Web Day Out&lt;/a&gt; — just three weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It’s also not that long until the start of a new financial year so if you’ve got training budget that needs to be used &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; year, send your team to Web Day Out. Not only is it excellent value for money, it’s also going to have an incredibly high density of knowledge bombs per talk.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/manuel-matuzovic/#talk&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/aleth-gueguen/#talk&quot;&gt;Progressive web apps&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/richard-rutter/#talk&quot;&gt;Web typography&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/rachel-andrew/#talk&quot;&gt;Browser support&lt;/a&gt;! And much more.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;If you like the sound of Web Day Out, you’ll also like &lt;a href=&quot;https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/&quot;&gt;State Of The Browser&lt;/a&gt;, which is just ten days away. In-person tickets for that event are now sold out, but online streaming tickets are still available.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Better yet, if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out&quot;&gt;buy a ticket to Web Day Out&lt;/a&gt;, you automatically get a free online streaming ticket for State Of The Browser!&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;So get your ticket in the next ten days, enjoy State Of The Browser from the comfort of your own home, and then enjoy a trip to Brighton for Web Day Out on Thursday, 12 March. See you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magic</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22399</link>

      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;I don’t like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about acts of prestidigitation and illusion. I mean the kind of magic that’s used to market technologies. It’s magic. It just works. Don’t think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/6786&quot;&gt;seamless and seamful design&lt;/a&gt; before. Seamlessness is often touted as the ultimate goal of UX—“don’t make me think!”—but it comes with a price. That price is the reduction of agency.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to front-end development, my distrust of magic tips over into being a complete control freak.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I don’t like using code that I haven’t written and understood myself. Sometimes its unavoidable. I use two JavaScript libraries on &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesession.org/&quot;&gt;The Session&lt;/a&gt;. One for displaying interactive maps and another for generating sheet music. As dependencies go, they’re very good but I still don’t like the feeling of being dependant on anything I don’t fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I can’t stomach the idea of using npm to install client-side JavaScript (which then installs more JavaScript, which in turn is dependant on even more JavaScript). It gives me the heebie-jeebies. I’m kind of astonished that most front-end developers have normalised doing daily trust falls with their codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;While I’m mistrustful of libraries, I’m completely allergic to frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Often I don’t distinguish between libraries and frameworks but the distinction matters here. Libraries are bits of other people’s code that I call from my code. Frameworks are other people’s code that call bits of my code.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Think of React. In order to use it, you basically have to adopt its idioms, its approach, its syntax. It’s a deeper level of dependency than just dropping in a regular piece of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve always avoided client-side React because of its direct harm to end users (over-engineered bloated sites that take way longer to load than they need to). But the truth is that I also really dislike the extra layer of abstraction it puts between me and the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Now, whenever there’s any talk about abstractions someone inevitably points out that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anildash.com/2026/02/11/coding-agents-as-the-new-compilers/&quot;&gt;when it comes to computers, there’s always &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; layer of abstraction&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not writing in binary, you don’t get to complain about &lt;a href=&quot;https://front-end.social/@leaverou/115991923267136151&quot;&gt;an extra layer of abstraction&lt;/a&gt; making you uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I get that. But I still draw a line. When it comes to front-end development, that line is for me to stay as close as I can to raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After all, that’s what users are going to get in their browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;My control freakery is not typical. It’s also not a very commercial or pragmatic attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve stopped doing front-end development for client projects at work. Partly that’s because I’m pretty slow; it makes more sense to give the work to a better, faster developer. But it’s also because of my aversion to React. Projects came in where usage of React was a foregone conclusion. I wouldn’t work on those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I mention this to point out that you probably shouldn’t adopt my inflexible mistrustful attitude if you want a career in front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Fortunately for me, front-end development still exists outside of client work. I get to have fun with my own website and with The Session. Heck, they even let me build the occasional hand-crafted website for a Clearleft event. I get to do all that &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedolectures.com/talks/do-things-the-long-hard-stupid-way/&quot;&gt;the long, hard stupid way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in the real world, the abstractions are piling up. Developers can now use large language models to generate code. Sometimes the code is good. Sometimes its not. You should probably check it before using it. But some developers just YOLO it straight to production.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;That gives me the heebie-jeebies, but then again, so did npm. Is it really all that different? With npm you dialled up other people’s code directly. With large language models, they first slurp up everyone’s code (like, the whole World Wide Web), run a computationally expensive process of tokenisation, and then give you the bit you need when you need it. In a way, large language model coding tools are like a turbo-charged npm with even more layers of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It’s not for me but I absolutely understand why it can work in a pragmatic commercial environment. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes-388&quot;&gt;Alice said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Knitting is the future of coding. Nobody knits because they want a quick or cheap jumper, they knit because they love the craft. This is the future of writing code by hand. You will do it because you find it satisfying but it will be neither the cheapest or quickest way to write software.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/2026/02/magic-words/&quot;&gt;as Dave points out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And so now we have these “magic words” in our codebases. Spells, essentially. Spells that work sometimes. Spells that we cast with no practical way to measure their effectiveness. They are prayers as much as they are instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I shudder!&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But again, this too is nothing new. We’ve all seen those codebases that contain mysterious arcane parts that nobody dares touch. &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;Webpack&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;. The issue isn’t with the code itself, but with the &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; of the code. If the understanding of the code was in one developer’s head, and that person has since left, the code is dangerous and best left untouched.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;This, as you can imagine, is a maintenance nightmare. That’s where I’ve seen the real cost of abstractions. Abstractions often really do speed up &lt;em&gt;production&lt;/em&gt;, but you pay the price in maintenance later on. If you want to understand the codebase, you must first understand the abstractions used in the codebase. That’s a lot to document, and let’s face it, documentation is the first casuality of almost every project.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;So perhaps my aversion to abstraction in general—and large language models in particular—is because I tend to work on long-term projects. This website and The Session have lifespans measured in decades. For these kinds of projects, maintenance is a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Large language model coding tools truly are magic.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I don’t like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Morrigan by Kim Curran</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22394</link>
      <guid>https://adactio.com/journal/22394</guid>

        &lt;p&gt;Every culture has its myths and legends. Greece has its gods and warriors. England has its stories of Arthur. Ireland has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann&quot;&gt;Tuatha Dé Danann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Cycle&quot;&gt;The Ulster Cycle&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But while the Arthurian legends and the Greek myths have been retold many times, the stories of ancient Ireland have remained largely untouched.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Kim Curran’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781405969376&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Morrigan&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; takes on this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The blurb for the book compares it &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781408890042&quot;&gt;Madeline Miller’s &lt;cite&gt;Circe&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a bold comparison. The writing in &lt;cite&gt;The Morrigan&lt;/cite&gt; isn’t in the same league as &lt;cite&gt;Circe&lt;/cite&gt;, but then again, very little is.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Structurally, the comparison makes complete sense.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Circe&lt;/cite&gt; starts with the titular nymph in the world of the gods of Olympus before moving on to more mortal affairs, coming to a head with the events of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus&quot;&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;’s story dominates.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Morrigan&lt;/cite&gt; starts with the titular goddess in the world of the gods of the Túatha Dé before moving on to more mortal affairs, coming to a head with the events of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A1in_B%C3%B3_C%C3%BAailnge&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Táin&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%BA_Chulainn&quot;&gt;Cú Chulainn&lt;/a&gt;’s story dominates.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I took me a little while to adjust to the tone, but once I did, I thoroughly enjoyed this retelling. It manages to simultaneously capture the bloody, over-the-top feeling of &lt;cite&gt;The Táin&lt;/cite&gt; while also having a distinctly modern twist. By the last third, I was completely engrossed.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;After finishing &lt;cite&gt;Circe&lt;/cite&gt; I went on a spree of reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/lists/greek-myths&quot;&gt;many, many modern retellings of Greek myths&lt;/a&gt;. Now that I’ve finished &lt;cite&gt;The Morrigan&lt;/cite&gt; I want to do the same for the Irish legends.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But I can’t. Apart from re-reading a translation of &lt;cite&gt;The Táin&lt;/cite&gt;, there’s not much else out there for me.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Kim Curran does have another book that’s just been released; &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780241713051&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Brigid&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the goddess? the saint? both?). If it’s anything like &lt;cite&gt;The Morrigan&lt;/cite&gt;, it’s going to be a must-read.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I hope these books are the first of many.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Concertina</title>

        &lt;p&gt;I watched a good film last night. &lt;a href=&quot;(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_(2025_film)&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Tornado&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the same writer and director of the also-excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_West&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Slow West&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Tornado&lt;/cite&gt; is a Scottish Samurai Western set in the 1790s. Although it’s not likely that many Samurai would’ve been in Scotland during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku&quot;&gt;the sakoku period&lt;/a&gt;, I was willingly able to suspend my disbelief …until something quite minor happened on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;One of the characters is seen playing a concertina. “Hang on”, I thought, “1790s? That’s not right!”&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;And indeed, once the film was over I reached for my laptop and confirmed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concertina&quot;&gt;the concertina&lt;/a&gt; is very much a 19th century invention.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Look, it’s not that I know when most musical instruments were invented, but I happened to know about the concertina’s origin because of a different technology.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;See, the concertina was invented by one &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone&quot;&gt;Charles Wheatsone&lt;/a&gt;. He invented quite a few things. He, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fothergill_Cooke&quot;&gt;William Cooke&lt;/a&gt;, more or less created the electric telegraph, around the same time as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse&quot;&gt;Samuel Morse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I only know this because of the excellent book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomstandage.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Tom Standage&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9780753807033&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Victorian Internet&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The remarkable story of the telegraph and the nineteenth century’s online pioneers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Prompted by that book, I found out more about Wheatstone, including the fact that he invented the concertina. So that’s why I found myself slightly taken out of the action when watching that film last night. In the 1790s, nobody was playing the concertina in Scotland or anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Today, though, the concertina is thriving, especially in Ireland. It’s particularly popular in County Clare. Though, as I’m writing this, I’m listening to the playing of a Kerryman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cormacbegley.com/&quot;&gt;Cormac Begley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ll be seeing him play tonight in the Brighton Dome where he’ll be providing the music for the superb Teaċ Damhsa production, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teacdamsa.com/production/mam/&quot;&gt;MÁM&lt;/a&gt;. This’ll be &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/notes/19684&quot;&gt;my second time experiencing it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i land=&quot;ie&quot;&gt;Táim ar bís!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daughters of Sparta by Claire Heywood</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22379</link>
      <guid>https://adactio.com/journal/22379</guid>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:45:57 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;Towards the end of 2025, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/22317&quot;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I think I might change things up in 2026. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to write all the little reviews at once, I think I should write a review as soon as I finish a book. Instead of holding onto my reckons for months, I can just set them free one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ll get the ball rolling with the first book I read in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before that one interesting lens to apply to modern retellings of the Greek myths is how they treat deities. Are gods and goddesses real in this story? Or is it a non-interventionist tale with a purely human cast? In her book The Shadow Of Perseus, Claire Heywood wrote about Perseus, Medusa, and Andromeda without any supernatural characters. Having been impressed by that, I figured I’d go back to investigate her debut, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529333695&quot;&gt;Daughters Of Sparta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The framing device is one I hadn’t come across before. It follows the diverging stories of sisters Helen and Clytemnestra, flipping back and forth between the two throughout their lives. I’ve read plenty of takes on the Trojan war, and I’ve read plenty of takes on Clytemnestra’s revenge, but I think this is the first time they’ve been combined like this.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Overall, it works. There are inevitable time jumps. Some time periods are bound to get more attention than others. And at some point, the narrative just has to wrap up, even though we know there’s pleny more that follows afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;All in all, a good addition to the list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/lists/greek-myths&quot;&gt;modern retellings of classical Greek stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/a/980/9781529333695&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images-eu.bookshop.org/product-images/images/9781529333695.jpg&quot; width=&quot;326&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Buy this book&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Web Day Out × State Of The Browser</title>

        &lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who likes &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/&quot;&gt;Web Day Out&lt;/a&gt;, you’re probably also the kind of person who likes &lt;a href=&quot;https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/&quot;&gt;State Of The Browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Web Day Out is all about what you can in web browsers right now, with an emphasis on immediately practical techniques and technologies. State Of The Browser is similar, but with room for fun demos that push the boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/&quot;&gt;State Of The Browser&lt;/a&gt; is on Saturday, 28 February.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/&quot;&gt;Web Day Out&lt;/a&gt; is on Thursday, 12 March.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It would be a shame if you had to choose between these two excellent events.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Well, you don’t have to!&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out&quot;&gt;buy a ticket for Web Day Out&lt;/a&gt; you can get a whopping 50% off the ticket price for State Of The Browser. Or if you can’t make it in person, your Web Day Out ticket gets you a &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; online ticket!&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, “Well, much as I’d love to go to both events, I don’t think I can &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/reasons-to-attend/#convince-your-boss&quot;&gt;convince my boss&lt;/a&gt; to give me &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; conference days.” Worry ye not! State Of The Browser is on a Saturday, so unless you’re working an extremely extended work week, you still only need to take one day away from your desk to go to two events.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;So don’t delay: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out&quot;&gt;get your ticket for Web Day Out&lt;/a&gt;. Then you’ll get an email with details on how to get your 50% discount for State Of The Browser (or your free online ticket, whichever you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But wait! What if you already bought a ticket for State Of The Browser? Check your email. You’ve been sent a very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; generous discount code for Web Day Out to thank you for getting your ticket nice and early.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ll see you at &lt;a href=&quot;https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/&quot;&gt;State Of The Browser&lt;/a&gt; in London …and then I’ll see you at &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/&quot;&gt;Web Day Out&lt;/a&gt; in Brighton!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;For the past few years, I’ve been &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/22166&quot;&gt;taking a trip to Spain&lt;/a&gt; at the end of September for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishfleadh.com/&quot;&gt;Cáceres Irish Fleadh&lt;/a&gt;. Last year I convinced my friends Liam and Monica to come along and they had a great time.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Like me, Liam just loves playing in sessions. Also like me, Liam likes to spend the gloomy short days of January thinking about travelling somewhere …and then playing in sessions there.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I told him I’d put together a list of potential trips for the discerning session hound. I figured I might as well share it here too…&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;First of all, there are Irish music festivals. Alas, most festivals don’t happen in the sunny climes of Spain. As you’d expect, most of them are in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’m heading to Carlingford at the end of this month for a weekend of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feilenatana.com/&quot;&gt;Féile na Tána&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t been before but it looks good. There’ll be the usual amalgam of workshops, concerts, and sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Myself and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordridden.com/&quot;&gt;Jessica&lt;/a&gt; will fly in to Belfast, then take the train down to Newry and get to Carlingford from there. You could fly into Dublin and get the train up to Dundalk, but the only Gatwick flights to Dublin are Ryan Air, and I’d rather entrust my instrument to EasyJet.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;At the end of March we’re heading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/&quot;&gt;Tullamore Trad Fest&lt;/a&gt;. That’s another one we haven’t been to before. Again, there’ll be workshops, concerts, and sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Tullamore is just an hour away from Dublin by train and has plenty of accommodation options. We’ve booked into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seadewhouse.com/&quot;&gt;a nice-looking B&amp;amp;B&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;There’s no avoiding Ryan Air for this trip and I want to take my good mandolin, so I’ve gone ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/articles/12889013645713-What-music-equipment-can-I-bring-on-board&quot;&gt;booked a separate seat&lt;/a&gt; for it. I don’t want to take any chances with an airline that actively seeks to elevate misery.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The festival I heartily recommend is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/&quot;&gt;Belfast Trad Fest&lt;/a&gt; at the end of July. It’s super convenient to get to with EasyJet flights from Gatwick—go to Belfast &lt;em&gt;city&lt;/em&gt; airport, which is right downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The festival offers a really good accommodation deal in modern student flats. The workshops are top-notch, and best of all, it has a really well-organised session trail. You can easily play in sessions all afternoon and evening.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;This year, for the first time ever, Belfast trad fest is immediately followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://fleadhcheoil.ie/&quot;&gt;the all-Ireland fleadh&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to be pandemonium. I’ve never been to the fleadh before but I’m going to stick around Belfast for it.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;You could head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/&quot;&gt;Willie Clancy Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Miltown Malbay at the start of July (the website seems to be having some issues right now). But good luck finding accommodation. The event is so big now that unless you’re camping, there’s not much chance of finding a place to stay. If you make it there though, non-stop sessions await. Non-stop chaos awaits too. That’s part of the deal. Great workshops though!&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;There are other festivals I haven’t been to but I’ve heard great things about. &lt;a href=&quot;https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/&quot;&gt;The Pádraig O’Keeffe Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Kerry in October sounds fantastic, especially if you like your polkas and slides. But it’s in Castleisland, which doesn’t have much in the way of accommodation. So unless you’ve got transport, it’s going to be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://kilkennytradfest.com/&quot;&gt;a trad fest in Kilkenny in March&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve never been but they’ve got a session trail. You’d need to fly into either Dublin or Cork and then get on a bus. Either way, it’s Ryan Air from Gatwick.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve also never been to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ennistradfest.com/&quot;&gt;Ennis Trad Fest&lt;/a&gt; in county Clare in November but I’ve heard good things. Accommodation for the 2026 event is already in short supply though.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But you don’t need a festival to play in sessions. In fact, the kind of sessions you end up in at festivals have a different vibe to the usual sessions, simply because they’re formed of a hodge-podge of visiting players.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;There a few spots in Ireland where you’re guaranteed a session pretty much any night of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I love Galway. There are afternoon sessions in Taafe’s and Tigh Cóilí as well as evening sessions in the Crane and other places. You’d need to fly into Dublin and get the train from there. It takes about two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Galway is busy in the summer time and accommodation can be pricy, but if you go off-season you can find some cheaper options.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Ennis has &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland&quot;&gt;music most nights&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a regular bus service between Ennis and Shannon airport that’s nice and quick. You’d need to fly Ryan Air from Gatwick though.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;And then there’s Belfast again. Even when the trad fest isn’t happening, Belfast has sessions seven nights a week. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/belfastsessionguide/&quot;&gt;Belfast session guide Instagram account&lt;/a&gt; for up-to-date details.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I recommend staying in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theflintbelfast.com/&quot;&gt;The Flint&lt;/a&gt;, but make sure you ask for a room on the top floor far away from the nightclub if you’re there on a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;So, to recap, here are some festivals to check out:&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feilenatana.com/&quot;&gt;Féile na Tána&lt;/a&gt; in Carlingford, county Louth in January (I’m going),&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tullamoretradfest.com/&quot;&gt;Tullamore Trad Fest&lt;/a&gt; in county  Offaly in March (I’m going),&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kilkennytradfest.com/&quot;&gt;Kilkenny Trad Fest&lt;/a&gt; also in March,&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scoilsamhraidhwillieclancy.com/&quot;&gt;Scoil Samhraidh Willie Clancy&lt;/a&gt; in Miltown Malbay, county Clare in July,&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belfasttraditionalmusic.com/&quot;&gt;Belfast Trad Fest&lt;/a&gt; at the end of July (I’m going),&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fleadhcheoil.ie/&quot;&gt;Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann&lt;/a&gt; also in Belfast at the start of August (I’m going),&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishfleadh.com/&quot;&gt;Cáceres Irish Fleadh&lt;/a&gt; in Spain in September (I’m going),&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://patrickokeeffefestival.com/&quot;&gt;The Pádraig O’Keeffe festival&lt;/a&gt; in Castleisland, county Kerry in October, and&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ennistradfest.com/&quot;&gt;Ennis Trad Fest&lt;/a&gt; in county Clare in November.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;And then for year-round session action, you can visit:&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Galway,+Ireland&quot;&gt;Galway&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Ennis%2C+Clare%2C+Ireland&quot;&gt;Ennis&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesession.org/sessions/search?q=Belfast,+Antrim,+Northern%20Ireland&quot;&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The datalist element on iOS 26</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22360</link>
      <guid>https://adactio.com/journal/22360</guid>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:28:06 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;datalist&lt;/code&gt; element is all fucked up on iOS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/21445&quot;&gt;Again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I haven’t “upgraded” my iPhone to iOS 26 and I have no plans to. The whole Liquid Glass thing is literally offputting. So I wouldn’t have known about the latest regression in Safari if a friend hadn’t texted me about the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;He was trying to do a search on &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesession.org/&quot;&gt;The Session&lt;/a&gt;. He was looking for the tune, &lt;cite&gt;The Road To Town&lt;/cite&gt;. He started typing this into the form on the home page of the site. He got as far as “The Road To”. That’s when the entire input was obscured by a suggestion from the associated &lt;code&gt;datalist&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adactio.com/images/ios26-datalist.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of The Session on an iPhone during a search on the homepage. The search input is completely obscured by the text: The Road To Lisdoonvarna.&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;This is incredibly annoying and seems to be a pattern of behaviour for Safari. Features are supported …technically. But the implementation is so buggy as to be unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ll probably have to do some user-agent sniffing, which I hate. And it won’t be enough to just sniff for Safari on iOS 26. Remember that every browser on iOS is just Webkit in a trenchcoat.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Time to file a bug and then wait God knows how long for an update to get rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=305719&quot;&gt;I filed a bug&lt;/a&gt;, but in the meantime it looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nielsleenheer.com/articles/2025/the-user-agent-string-of-safari-on-ios-26-and-macos-26/&quot;&gt;user-agent sniffing is going to be impossible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Switch</title>
      <link>https://adactio.com/journal/22355</link>
      <guid>https://adactio.com/journal/22355</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:48:28 GMT</pubDate>

        &lt;ins&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Never mind! It turns that Google’s issue is with &lt;em&gt;unreachable&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt; files, not absent &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt; files. They really need to improve their messaging. Stand down everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/ins&gt;
        
        &lt;del&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A bit has been flipped on Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Previously, the Googlebot would index any web page it came across, unless a &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt; file said otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/community-video/360202946/fix-robots-txt-unreachable-error-website-not-indexing&quot;&gt;a &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt; file is &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; in order for the Googlebot to index a website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;This puzzles me. Until now, Google was all about “organising the world’s information and making it accessible.” This switch-up will limit “the world’s information” to “the information on websites that have a &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt; file.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;They’re free to do this. Despite what some people think, Google isn’t a utility. It’s a business. Other search engines are available, with different business models. &lt;a href=&quot;https://kagi.com/&quot;&gt;Kagi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot;&gt;Duck Duck Go&lt;/a&gt;. Google != the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I am curious about this latest move with Google Search though. I’d love to know if it only applies to Google’s search bot. Google has other bots out crawling the web: &lt;code&gt;Adsbot-Google&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Google-Extended&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Googlebot-Image&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GoogleOther&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Mediapartners-Google&lt;/code&gt;. I’m probably missing a few.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;If the new default only applies to the searchbot and doesn’t include say, the crawler that’s fracking the web in order train Google’s large language model, then this is how things work now:&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Your website &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; appear in search results unless you explicitly &lt;strong&gt;opt in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Your website &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be used as training data unless you explicitly &lt;strong&gt;opt out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It would be good to get some clarity on this. Alas, the Google Search team are notoriously tight-lipped so I’m not holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/del&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Stop me if this sounds familiar to you…&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;There’s a conference you heard about it. It sounded really good but you never got ’round to getting a ticket. You were too busy thinking about work stuff. It was just one of those things that remained in the idle thought stage.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Then the day of the conference rolls around. You’re sitting in front of your computer seeing the social media posts from people at the event who are having a ball. The talks sound really good and you wish you could be there. You wonder why you never got ’round to getting that ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve experienced that when &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffconf.org/&quot;&gt;FFconf&lt;/a&gt; is happening and people like me are in the audience posting about some revelatory insight we’ve just received. Or maybe you see the blog posts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://marcthiele.com/photos/dconstruct-2022&quot;&gt;pictures from an event like dConstruct&lt;/a&gt; and you realise that you missed your chance to experience something special.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve certainly experienced it when I’m not in Düsseldorf or Berlin for &lt;a href=&quot;https://marcthiele.com/photos/dconstruct-2022&quot;&gt;Beyond Tellerrand&lt;/a&gt; and all my friends are posting about how excellent it is.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;It’s kind of like FOMO but instead of fear of missing out, it’s more like &lt;dfn&gt;regret at missing out: RAMO&lt;/dfn&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;I’m giving you advance warning. If you have anything at all to do with front-end development and you don’t come to &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/&quot;&gt;Web Day Out&lt;/a&gt;, you are definitely going to experience RAMO.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Seriously, it is shaping up to be something very special indeed. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/agenda/#schedule&quot;&gt;the schedule&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webdayout.com/jemima-abu/#talk&quot;&gt;I can’t believe it’s not JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
