      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CSS became more powerful over the years, allowing developers to create interactive components without relying on JavaScript. One such component is an animated accordion that smoothly expands and collapses content sections. In this article, we&amp;#39;ll explore how to create a CSS-only animated accordion that dynamically adjusts its height based on the content inside.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Streaming JSON in just 200 lines of JavaScript</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was continueing my exploration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/vanilla-react-server-components-with-no-framework&quot;&gt;React server components&lt;/a&gt; when I stumbled upon on &lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/progressive-json/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about progressive JSON. Dan Abramov describes a technique for streaming JSON from a server to a client in chunks, allowing the client to start rendering parts of the data before the entire payload has been received. This can significantly improve perceived performance, especially for large datasets. So, I started wondering how much of an effort it would be to implement something like that. It turned out a fun exercise, and I ended up with a small (200loc) library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/streamson&quot;&gt;Streamson&lt;/a&gt;. So, this post is about how I built it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Azbuka: Treating CSS Like a Real Programming Language (Finally)</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working on CSS tooling (on and off) since August 2013, when I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/absurd&quot;&gt;AbsurdJS&lt;/a&gt;. Later, in January 2016, I &amp;quot;invented&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/cssx&quot;&gt;CSSX&lt;/a&gt; - writing CSS directly in JavaScript. None of those became a thing, but they were incredibly interesting experiments. I had some time during the holidays and decided to materialize an idea that I&amp;#39;m shaping the last couple of months. And so I &amp;quot;accidentally&amp;quot; wrote a CSS compiler. It&amp;#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://azbuka.krasimirtsonev.com/&quot;&gt;Azbuka&lt;/a&gt; (it means &amp;quot;alphabet&amp;quot; in Bulgarian).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>React Server Components support without a framework</title>

        &lt;p&gt;I was at &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactsummit.com/&quot;&gt;ReactSummit&lt;/a&gt; this June and spoke with some folks from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vercel.com&quot;&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextjs.org/&quot;&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components&quot;&gt;RSC&lt;/a&gt; support outside of the framework. I really wanted to try all the cool stuff but couldnâ€™t afford to migrate my massive apps to Next.js. The conclusion was clear: itâ€™s difficult to start using RSC without a framework.  &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â€œHold my ðŸº,â€ I said to myself, and started exploring. Iâ€™ll admitâ€”it wasnâ€™t easy. But three months later, I have a solution: meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/forket&quot;&gt;Forket&lt;/a&gt;. Itâ€™s a tool that splits your code into client and server versions, so you can run &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components&quot;&gt;React Server Components&lt;/a&gt; without a framework.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought that after the first one, it couldnâ€™t get any better â€” but the awesome team behind the event proved me wrong. Two days of inspiring talks and one day of workshop for me. Everything was perfectly planned and executed for both speakers and attendees.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        &lt;p&gt;This year I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/athletes/8339758&quot;&gt;started running&lt;/a&gt; and I got really into it. And as it happens with every hobby there are some purchases involved. I invested in a new watch - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1228429/pn/010-02904-20&quot;&gt;Garmin FÄ“nix 8+&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m a bit of a geeky person so I started playing with it. I explored all the options, apps and a couple of watch faces. I also checked how much of an effort it is to create my own thing for it and it appears that it&amp;#39;s not a big deal. This article is covering my process with some code samples and a list of the tools that I used.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are not up for reading here&amp;#39;s a short podcast that goes over what&amp;#39;s in this article:&lt;/p&gt;

Well, it didn&amp;#39;t. I used a service for &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; QR code generation, and the link expired. So, I learned my lesson and came up with a line that generates whatever code I need right into my terminal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reactivity became de-factor a standard in the last couple of years. All the major frameworks have some reactivity model implemented. One of the biggest even has the name &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/keyword/React&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many moons ago, I was writing a lot of Flash applications. One thing was typical, and that was a progress indication of something that we were downloading. The loaded bytes of the Flash file (.swf) itself and later of some other resource the application needs. Once I started writing everything in JavaScript, this &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; disappeared. In this post, we&amp;#39;ll see how to implement it with vanilla JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Not only me but the whole community was asking about that constantly over the years. The browser vendors heard that plea, and today, we have CSS nesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this article, I&amp;#39;ll show you how I built a source viewer. It&amp;#39;s distributed as a npm package &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/view-source&quot;&gt;view-source&lt;/a&gt; and it could render the content of a directory in a nice tree-view style.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not open-sourcing very often anymore, but recently I finished developing a small tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/q2m&quot;&gt;q2m&lt;/a&gt; that I believe is worth sharing. It&amp;#39;s a library designed to convert URL parameters into MongoDB queries, which I needed for my latest project, a little SaaS called &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumina.tools/&quot;&gt;Lumina CMS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some people say that 2023 will be the year of AI. With tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/dall-e-2/&quot;&gt;DALLÂ·E&lt;/a&gt; the world is definitely changing. There are different opinions on how such instruments will affect the everyday tasks of the professionals. My two cents (for now) are that those are just tools to achieve what we want quicker and more efficiently. Who knows, someday I may call myself a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;prompt engineer&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. For the time being, though, I&amp;#39;m still writing a lot of stuff alone and occasionally ask ChatGPT for help.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I hit an interesting &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; while working on a SPA application. Clicking an anchor link that points to a fragment on the page fires the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/popstate_event&quot;&gt;History API&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;popstate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; event. This triggers some logic on my end, which was not my intent. I fixed that with a bit of JavaScript, and I had to share the snippet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last year or so, I worked on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daskalo.dev&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; where I would publish video courses. The first one is on web fundamentals (in Bulgarian), and it&amp;#39;s almost ready. You can check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://daskalo.dev/courses/web-fundamentals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But this article is not about that. It&amp;#39;s about a platform feature I built - an in-house validator to exercise the gained HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. After each lesson, I give a task to the students, and they can work on it right in the browser. The small application became an inspiration for another project - &lt;a href=&quot;https://iloveweb.dev/&quot;&gt;iloveweb.dev&lt;/a&gt;. So, I decided to share how the validation works.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The game got a lot of traction a couple of months ago when The New York Times bought it. I was playing it too, so I decided to create my version in my native language (Bulgarian). This is how &lt;a href=&quot;https://duma.fun/?u=eng5&quot;&gt;duma.fun&lt;/a&gt; was born (in Bulgarian &lt;em&gt;duma&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt;). And as usually happens with my &amp;quot;little&amp;quot; experiments, I didn&amp;#39;t stop at just implementing the basics. I managed to translate the initial ~300 lines of code into a three months-long project. Here&amp;#39;s why, what, and how.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

I like it because it&amp;#39;s HTML-based. I have complete control of everything and can easily publish the slides online. However, one thing bugs me every single time - the size of my content. I want to use all the available space. This becomes very important when I&amp;#39;m showing code to people. That&amp;#39;s why I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/simpre&quot;&gt;SimPre&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a 10KB HTML presentation framework that properly scales and positions my content.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Did you ever wondered how the call-to-action widgets work? You know, those little buttons for sharing content in the social networks. Very often they are distributed as iframes but sometimes we have to copy/paste script tags. And the instructions are &amp;quot;Place the following code where you want the button to appear&amp;quot;. But if that&amp;#39;s a script tag how it knows where to inject the button? The goal of this article is to give you an answer on this question.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A white label app is an app that we build once and &amp;quot;resell&amp;quot; it to other people/companies. Very often we are talking about applying different themes but sometimes we have to change logic too. Such changes should be as declarative as possible so they scale well. Otherwise is more of a copy/paste exercise. In this article I want to sketch out a couple of approaches for white labeling in React applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on a personal project and I&amp;#39;m using the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;. There are so many things that you can do. All the tools that you may need are probably there. This of course comes with a price. In this article I&amp;#39;ll share a tip how to reduce your spendings there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Using JavaScript module system for state management</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hot topic last couple of years is &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/article/react-50-shades-of-state&quot;&gt;state management&lt;/a&gt;. Especially in the front-end apps. There are lots of problems and lots of solutions. One thing thought is totally ignored in this context - the JavaScript module system. I&amp;#39;m very often reaching out to this approach and decided to share it here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;These days I did (again) a bunch of changes in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/article/google-tag-manager-and-google-analytics&quot;&gt;Google tag manager&lt;/a&gt;. This time however was more of a refactoring exercise. So, I had to prove that the tags that were placed before the refactoring exist after the refactoring. And what we programmers do in such cases - we write tests. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back in February last year I blog on topic &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/article/email-not-working-after-dns-change&quot;&gt;Email not working after DNS change&lt;/a&gt;. Well, I had kinda similar situation but not exactly. This time I bought a domain from Google and wanted to use an email with it. The setup wasn&amp;#39;t obvious for me so I decided to document the process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reinventing the routing in React apps</title>

        &lt;p&gt;The router is the backbone of your application. Trust me, that&amp;#39;s how it is and I can prove it. One of the fundamental ideas in Web is the URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Or the way of how we very often call it - &amp;quot;web address&amp;quot;. No mather what you are building there is a web address which identifies your resource. The router is the front office that accepts the request to particular URL and wires it to a logic. Logic for generating HTML or JSON response or something else. So, the router is very important part of your system.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At the end of last year I rewrote one of my favorite projects - a vanilla JS router called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/navigo&quot;&gt;Navigo&lt;/a&gt;. I was procrastinating this work for years. Finally I did it in TypeScript and wrote 100+ unit tests along the way. This refactoring opens the door for new features and more importantly, for integrating the library into other places. Like React for example.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transpile to ES modules with Babel</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While I was working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/navigo&quot;&gt;Navigo&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/261&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; popped out. It was about using the library in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/dev-server&quot;&gt;Web Dev Server&lt;/a&gt; where we have everything in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/keyword/typescript&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;. And something was not ok with Navigo. The npm package wasn&amp;#39;t exported properly and we were keep getting a &lt;code&gt;does not provide an export named &amp;#39;default&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; error. It turned out the problem is that Navigo is not exported properly as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules&quot;&gt;ES module&lt;/a&gt; (also known as ESM).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Both I&amp;#39;m unit testing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jestjs.io/&quot;&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt;. There is some logic that leads to a warning which I&amp;#39;m doing with &lt;code&gt;console.warn&lt;/code&gt;. In the unit tests this is happening quite often so I want to suppress it. Also I want to verify that it happens on the right place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At work we have a project that uses &lt;code&gt;node:10-jessie&lt;/code&gt; image as a base for its docker container. That image has no &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; inside so I wondered how to check the content of a file. Luckily &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; has a neat command to copy files from and to a pod.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you are building some sort of an app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt; is probably part of your build system. It is that thing which converts our fancy code to valid, working in a browser, JavaScript. Just recently at work I had to design a solution that swaps a class based on the environment. Or in another words, we have logic that should not reach our users. The file should be available locally and on our staging environment but not in production. A tiny Babel plugin was the cheapest solution for me so I decided to share the result.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Just recently I had to do changes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tagmanager.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Tag Manager&lt;/a&gt; at work. It&amp;#39;s interesting how I keep forgetting how everything works. So I finally decided to sit down and write an article about these things. If nothing else I will have a good memory snapshot to remind me what is what.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JavaScript is your behavior layer; the way to add interactivity to your sites, to provide a slick and delightful user experience, to make everything fast and easy and clean. But at some point everything changed: the tail started to wag the dog instead and development became JavaScript-first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>React: 50 shades of state</title>
      <link>https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/react-50-shades-of-state</link>

      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We all know that one of the most challenging task in software development is &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/keyword/state&quot;&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; management. This is especially true for the JavaScript world. There are thousands of articles on this topic and so I decided to write another one ðŸ˜. I wanted to share my current thoughts on the different state types. I found that answering &amp;quot;What lives where?&amp;quot; question is far more important than the actual state management. Which more or less is an implementation detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>
        &lt;p&gt;This weekend I decided to play with the new kid on the block - Facebook&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://recoiljs.org/&quot;&gt;Recoil&lt;/a&gt; library for managing state. I did the trivial counter example to see how it works. It&amp;#39;s pretty simple idea so I wondered how much it takes to replicate its features. I found the exact answer - 70 lines of code. Obviously, my implementation didn&amp;#39;t cover everything but it was fun so I decided to share my findings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A side note: I did not look at the code of Recoil. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be bias on how to write my version.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
