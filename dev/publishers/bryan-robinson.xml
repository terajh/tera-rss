      <content:encoded>I worked at an agency for almost six years. In that time, I created only a handful of static sites. Part of this was because the agency had a custom content management system. The other part was an unwillingness to give up &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; websites. I&amp;apos;ve created a website to aggregate resources for agencies and freelancers looking to branch out into the JAMstack.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I love the new layout modes in CSS. Grid and Flexbox are both amazing features. They each have their place. What if I told you that if you used the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; one, you could double your CSS and HTML? Let&amp;apos;s take a look at what appears to be a simple promo grid.</content:encoded>

When it’s ready for use in production, it’s going to drastically change the way we do layout on the web. Currently, there’s no real browser support. Edge and IE10/11 &amp;quot;support&amp;quot; grid, but they implemented an early version of the specification and it’s significantly broken.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>Layout in CSS is hard. We’ve spent the 2 decades since the inception of CSS battling with its idea of how to lay out content on the web. When we moved from table-based layouts to CSS layouts with floats and positioning, we gained a LOT of flexibility, but we also lost things like vertical centering that tables afforded us. Floats and positioning got us a long way to making really nice looking sites, but with the advent of responsive design and fluid layouts, the struggle has been real...</content:encoded>
