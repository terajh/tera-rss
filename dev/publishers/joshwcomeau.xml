      <title>Brand New Layouts with CSS Subgrid</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>Subgrid allows us to extend a grid template down through the DOM tree, so that deeply-nested elements can participate in the same grid layout. At first glance, I thought this would be a helpful convenience, but it turns out that it’s &lt;em&gt;so much more.&lt;/em&gt; Subgrid unlocks exciting new layout possibilities, stuff we couldn’t do until now. ✨</content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded>The “linear()” timing function is a game-changer; it allows us to model physics-based motion right in vanilla CSS! That said, there are some limitations and quirks to be aware of. I’ve been experimenting with this API for a while now, and in this post, I’ll share all of the tips and tricks I’ve learned for using it effectively. ✨</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>CSS has been on fire lately, with tons of great new features. @starting-style is an interesting one; it allows us to use CSS transitions for enter animations, something previously reserved for CSS keyframe animations. But is the juice worth the squeeze?</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>One of the most perplexing and befuddling things in CSS for me, for many years, was the behaviour of percentage-based heights. Sometimes, seemingly at random, setting &lt;code&gt;height: 100%&lt;/code&gt; would have no effect at all. When I finally figured out what was going on, it was like a puzzle piece snapping into place; everything made so much more sense! In this post, I’ll share the epiphany I had, and we’ll explore some solutions.</content:encoded>
