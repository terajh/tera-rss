      <content:encoded>I concluded my 2024 review post by saying that I hoped to make the move back to the North of England in 2025. The event that defined 2025 (other than my 50th birthday!) is that I managed to do just that, and I&amp;#8217;m writing this post from a little town in Northumberland, where I&amp;#8217;ve been [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I&amp;#8217;ve been an amateur genealogist since I was a teenager. I started before the internet existed. This was a world where finding a single fact about a not-too-distant ancestor could involve an entire day of hauling huge indexes off shelves, then waiting five days for the certificate to arrive. It was time-consuming and expensive. As [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>I&amp;#8217;m really excited that the reading-flow and reading-order properties are in Chrome 137 (current beta, will be Chrome stable as of May 27, 2025). Finding a way to deal with the visual and source order disconnect created by grid and flex layout has been something I&amp;#8217;ve kept returning to ever since grid shipped in browsers.

      <content:encoded>Ever since I became an editor of the Multiple-column layout specification I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to add the ability to let overflow columns wrap in the block direction, rather than extend out in the inline direction—creating the sort of horizontal scrollbar that almost nobody wants. And, now we&amp;#8217;re doing it. I&amp;#8217;m working on the specification (which is [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>2024 went fast, and this post looks back at some of the things that featured in another far too busy year. Work Life at Google has not got any less challenging or busy during 2024, but I&amp;#8217;m proud of the things my team and I have achieved.

      <content:encoded>In the before times—before COVID, before I was a Google employee, before the seismic shift my life took in 2020 and 2021—I travelled for around half of the year, speaking at conferences and leading workshops. These days, I don&amp;#8217;t do as much speaking, but I get to do some, and I&amp;#8217;ve had some great opportunities [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>There&amp;#8217;s a First Public Working Draft of CSS Display 4, which includes the work on the new reading-flow property. The property aims to solve the issue where the source (and therefore tab) order of a page gets disconnected from layout when using CSS grid layout or flexbox. This is a problem I&amp;#8217;ve been talking and [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>When we share content about emerging web platform features, we have to be careful that we aren’t frustrating people with things they can’t use yet. However there is a place for talking about new things, and people who enjoy hearing about them. This post is about some of the ways I try to meet the [&amp;#8230;]</content:encoded>
