        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;React 18&lt;/a&gt; was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we’ve learned is that it’s frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we’re exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We typically have a number of projects being worked on at any time, ranging from the more experimental to the clearly defined. Looking ahead, we’d like to start regularly sharing more about what we’ve been working on with the community across these projects.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To set expectations, this is not a roadmap with clear timelines. Many of these projects are under active research and are difficult to put concrete ship dates on. They may possibly never even ship in their current iteration depending on what we learn. Instead, we want to share with you the problem spaces we’re actively thinking about, and what we’ve learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;server-components&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#server-components&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Server Components &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We announced an &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;experimental demo of React Server Components&lt;/a&gt; (RSC) in December 2020. Since then we’ve been finishing up its dependencies in React 18, and working on changes inspired by experimental feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In particular, we’re abandoning the idea of having forked I/O libraries (eg react-fetch), and instead adopting an async/await model for better compatibility. This doesn’t technically block RSC’s release because you can also use routers for data fetching. Another change is that we’re also moving away from the file extension approach in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/189#issuecomment-1116482278&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;annotating boundaries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re working together with Vercel and Shopify to unify bundler support for shared semantics in both Webpack and Vite. Before launch, we want to make sure that the semantics of RSCs are the same across the whole React ecosystem. This is the major blocker for reaching stable.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;asset-loading&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#asset-loading&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Asset Loading &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Currently, assets like scripts, external styles, fonts, and images are typically preloaded and loaded using external systems. This can make it tricky to coordinate across new environments like streaming, server components, and more.
        We’re looking at adding APIs to preload and load deduplicated external assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re also looking at having these support Suspense so you can have images, CSS, and fonts that block display until they’re loaded but don’t block streaming and concurrent rendering. This can help avoid &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1516852731251724293&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“popcorning“&lt;/a&gt; as the visuals pop and layout shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;static-server-rendering-optimizations&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#static-server-rendering-optimizations&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Static Server Rendering Optimizations &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are great ways to get performance for cacheable pages, but we think we can add features to improve performance of dynamic Server Side Rendering (SSR) – especially when most but not all of the content is cacheable. We’re exploring ways to optimize server rendering utilizing compilation and static passes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;react-compiler&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#react-compiler&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;React Optimizing Compiler &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We gave an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGEMwh32soc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;early preview&lt;/a&gt; of React Forget at React Conf 2021. It’s a compiler that automatically generates the equivalent of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useMemo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useCallback&lt;/code&gt; calls to minimize the cost of re-rendering, while retaining React’s programming model.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Recently, we finished a rewrite of the compiler to make it more reliable and capable. This new architecture allows us to analyze and memoize more complex patterns such as the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure#local-mutation-your-components-little-secret&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;local mutations&lt;/a&gt;, and opens up many new compile-time optimization opportunities beyond just being on par with memoization hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re also working on a playground for exploring many aspects of the compiler. While the goal of the playground is to make development of the compiler easier, we think that it will make it easier to try it out and build intuition for what the compiler does. It reveals various insights into how it works under the hood, and live renders the compiler’s outputs as you type. This will be shipped together with the compiler when it’s released.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;offscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#offscreen&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Offscreen &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today, if you want to hide and show a component, you have two options. One is to add or remove it from the tree completely. The problem with this approach is that the state of your UI is lost each time you unmount, including state stored in the DOM, like scroll position.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The other option is to keep the component mounted and toggle the appearance visually using CSS. This preserves the state of your UI, but it comes at a performance cost, because React must keep rendering the hidden component and all of its children whenever it receives new updates.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Offscreen introduces a third option: hide the UI visually, but deprioritize its content. The idea is similar in spirit to the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;content-visibility&lt;/code&gt; CSS property: when content is hidden, it doesn’t need to stay in sync with the rest of the UI. React can defer the rendering work until the rest of the app is idle, or until the content becomes visible again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Offscreen is a low level capability that unlocks high level features. Similar to React’s other concurrent features like &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;startTransition&lt;/code&gt;, in most cases you won’t interact with the Offscreen API directly, but instead via an opinionated framework to implement patterns like:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant transitions.&lt;/strong&gt; Some routing frameworks already prefetch data to speed up subsequent navigations, like when hovering over a link. With Offscreen, they’ll also be able to prerender the next screen in the background.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reusable state.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, when navigating between routes or tabs, you can use Offscreen to preserve the state of the previous screen so you can switch back and pick up where you left off.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtualized list rendering.&lt;/strong&gt; When displaying large lists of items, virtualized list frameworks will prerender more rows than are currently visible. You can use Offscreen to prerender the hidden rows at a lower priority than the visible items in the list.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backgrounded content.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re also exploring a related feature for deprioritizing content in the background without hiding it, like when displaying a modal overlay.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;transition-tracing&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#transition-tracing&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Transition Tracing &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Currently, React has two profiling tools. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;original Profiler&lt;/a&gt; shows an overview of all the commits in a profiling session. For each commit, it also shows all components that rendered and the amount of time it took for them to render. We also have a beta version of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/76&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Timeline Profiler&lt;/a&gt; introduced in React 18 that shows when components schedule updates and when React works on these updates. Both of these profilers help developers identify performance problems in their code.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve realized that developers don’t find knowing about individual slow commits or components out of context that useful. It’s more useful to know about what actually causes the slow commits. And that developers want to be able to track specific interactions (eg a button click, an initial load, or a page navigation) to watch for performance regressions and to understand why an interaction was slow and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We previously tried to solve this issue by creating an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/8de925562903afd2e7a12554adcdda16&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Interaction Tracing API&lt;/a&gt;, but it had some fundamental design flaws that reduced the accuracy of tracking why an interaction was slow and sometimes resulted in interactions never ending. We ended up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20037&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;removing this API&lt;/a&gt; because of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are working on a new version for the Interaction Tracing API (tentatively called Transition Tracing because it is initiated via &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;startTransition&lt;/code&gt;) that solves these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;new-react-docs&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#new-react-docs&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New React Docs &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Last year, we announced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;beta version&lt;/a&gt; of the new React documentation website. The new learning materials teach Hooks first and has new diagrams, illustrations, as well as many interactive examples and challenges. We took a break from that work to focus on the React 18 release, but now that React 18 is out, we’re actively working to finish and ship the new documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are currently writing a detailed section about effects, as we’ve heard that is one of the more challenging topics for both new and experienced React users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Synchronizing with Effects&lt;/a&gt; is the first published page in the series, and there are more to come in the following weeks. When we first started writing a detailed section about effects, we’ve realized that many common effect patterns can be simplified by adding a new primitive to React. We’ve shared some initial thoughts on that in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/220&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;useEvent RFC&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently in early research, and we are still iterating on the idea. We appreciate the community’s comments on the RFC so far, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/3308&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; and contributions to the ongoing documentation rewrite. We’d specifically like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harish-sethuraman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Harish Kumar&lt;/a&gt; for submitting and reviewing many improvements to the new website implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sophiebits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sophie Alpert&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing this blog post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;React 18 is now available on npm!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In our last post, we shared step-by-step instructions for &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;upgrading your app to React 18&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, we’ll give an overview of what’s new in React 18, and what it means for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our latest major version includes out-of-the-box improvements like automatic batching, new APIs like startTransition, and streaming server-side rendering with support for Suspense.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Many of the features in React 18 are built on top of our new concurrent renderer, a behind-the-scenes change that unlocks powerful new capabilities. Concurrent React is opt-in — it’s only enabled when you use a concurrent feature — but we think it will have a big impact on the way people build applications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve spent years researching and developing support for concurrency in React, and we’ve taken extra care to provide a gradual adoption path for existing users. Last summer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;we formed the React 18 Working Group&lt;/a&gt; to gather feedback from experts in the community and ensure a smooth upgrade experience for the entire React ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, we shared a lot of this vision at React Conf 2021:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The most important addition in React 18 is something we hope you never have to think about: concurrency. We think this is largely true for application developers, though the story may be a bit more complicated for library maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Concurrency is not a feature, per se. It’s a new behind-the-scenes mechanism that enables React to prepare multiple versions of your UI at the same time. You can think of concurrency as an implementation detail — it’s valuable because of the features that it unlocks. React uses sophisticated techniques in its internal implementation, like priority queues and multiple buffering. But you won’t see those concepts anywhere in our public APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When we design APIs, we try to hide implementation details from developers. As a React developer, you focus on &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you want the user experience to look like, and React handles &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to deliver that experience. So we don’t expect React developers to know how concurrency works under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, Concurrent React is more important than a typical implementation detail — it’s a foundational update to React’s core rendering model. So while it’s not super important to know how concurrency works, it may be worth knowing what it is at a high level.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A key property of Concurrent React is that rendering is interruptible. When you first upgrade to React 18, before adding any concurrent features, updates are rendered the same as in previous versions of React — in a single, uninterrupted, synchronous transaction. With synchronous rendering, once an update starts rendering, nothing can interrupt it until the user can see the result on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a concurrent render, this is not always the case. React may start rendering an update, pause in the middle, then continue later. It may even abandon an in-progress render altogether. React guarantees that the UI will appear consistent even if a render is interrupted. To do this, it waits to perform DOM mutations until the end, once the entire tree has been evaluated. With this capability, React can prepare new screens in the background without blocking the main thread. This means the UI can respond immediately to user input even if it’s in the middle of a large rendering task, creating a fluid user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another example is reusable state. Concurrent React can remove sections of the UI from the screen, then add them back later while reusing the previous state. For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to restore the previous screen in the same state it was in before. In an upcoming minor, we’re planning to add a new component called &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Offscreen&gt;&lt;/code&gt; that implements this pattern. Similarly, you’ll be able to use Offscreen to prepare new UI in the background so that it’s ready before the user reveals it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Concurrent rendering is a powerful new tool in React and most of our new features are built to take advantage of it, including Suspense, transitions, and streaming server rendering. But React 18 is just the beginning of what we aim to build on this new foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;gradually-adopting-concurrent-features&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#gradually-adopting-concurrent-features&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gradually Adopting Concurrent Features &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technically, concurrent rendering is a breaking change. Because concurrent rendering is interruptible, components behave slightly differently when it is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In our testing, we’ve upgraded thousands of components to React 18. What we’ve found is that nearly all existing components “just work” with concurrent rendering, without any changes. However, some of them may require some additional migration effort. Although the changes are usually small, you’ll still have the ability to make them at your own pace. The new rendering behavior in React 18 is &lt;strong&gt;only enabled in the parts of your app that use new features.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The overall upgrade strategy is to get your application running on React 18 without breaking existing code. Then you can gradually start adding concurrent features at your own pace. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/strict-mode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;StrictMode&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help surface concurrency-related bugs during development. Strict Mode doesn’t affect production behavior, but during development it will log extra warnings and double-invoke functions that are expected to be idempotent. It won’t catch everything, but it’s effective at preventing the most common types of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After you upgrade to React 18, you’ll be able to start using concurrent features immediately. For example, you can use startTransition to navigate between screens without blocking user input. Or useDeferredValue to throttle expensive re-renders.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, long term, we expect the main way you’ll add concurrency to your app is by using a concurrent-enabled library or framework. In most cases, you won’t interact with concurrent APIs directly. For example, instead of developers calling startTransition whenever they navigate to a new screen, router libraries will automatically wrap navigations in startTransition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It may take some time for libraries to upgrade to be concurrent compatible. We’ve provided new APIs to make it easier for libraries to take advantage of concurrent features. In the meantime, please be patient with maintainers as we work to gradually migrate the React ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;suspense-in-data-frameworks&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#suspense-in-data-frameworks&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Suspense in Data Frameworks &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In React 18, you can start using Suspense for data fetching in opinionated frameworks like Relay, Next.js, Hydrogen, or Remix. Ad hoc data fetching with Suspense is technically possible, but still not recommended as a general strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the future, we may expose additional primitives that could make it easier to access your data with Suspense, perhaps without the use of an opinionated framework. However, Suspense works best when it’s deeply integrated into your application’s architecture: your router, your data layer, and your server rendering environment. So even long term, we expect that libraries and frameworks will play a crucial role in the React ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As in previous versions of React, you can also use Suspense for code splitting on the client with React.lazy. But our vision for Suspense has always been about much more than loading code — the goal is to extend support for Suspense so that eventually, the same declarative Suspense fallback can handle any asynchronous operation (loading code, data, images, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server Components&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an upcoming feature that allows developers to build apps that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering. Server Components is not inherently coupled to Concurrent React, but it’s designed to work best with concurrent features like Suspense and streaming server rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Server Components is still experimental, but we expect to release an initial version in a minor 18.x release. In the meantime, we’re working with frameworks like Next.js, Hydrogen, and Remix to advance the proposal and get it ready for broad adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. Without automatic batching, we only batched updates inside React event handlers. Updates inside of promises, setTimeout, native event handlers, or any other event were not batched in React by default. With automatic batching, these updates will be batched automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Before: only React events were batched.&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setFlag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// React will render twice, once for each state update (no batching)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// After: updates inside of timeouts, promises,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// native event handlers or any other event are batched.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// React will only re-render once at the end (that&apos;s batching!)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A transition is a new concept in React to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgent updates&lt;/strong&gt; reflect direct interaction, like typing, clicking, pressing, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition updates&lt;/strong&gt; transition the UI from one view to another.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Urgent updates like typing, clicking, or pressing, need immediate response to match our intuitions about how physical objects behave. Otherwise they feel “wrong”. However, transitions are different because the user doesn’t expect to see every intermediate value on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, when you select a filter in a dropdown, you expect the filter button itself to respond immediately when you click. However, the actual results may transition separately. A small delay would be imperceptible and often expected. And if you change the filter again before the results are done rendering, you only care to see the latest results.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Typically, for the best user experience, a single user input should result in both an urgent update and a non-urgent one. You can use startTransition API inside an input event to inform React which updates are urgent and which are “transitions”:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;startTransition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Urgent: Show what was typed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setInputValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Mark any state updates inside as transitions&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;startTransition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Transition: Show the results&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setSearchQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Updates wrapped in startTransition are handled as non-urgent and will be interrupted if more urgent updates like clicks or key presses come in. If a transition gets interrupted by the user (for example, by typing multiple characters in a row), React will throw out the stale rendering work that wasn’t finished and render only the latest update.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useTransition&lt;/code&gt;: a hook to start transitions, including a value to track the pending state.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;startTransition&lt;/code&gt;: a method to start transitions when the hook cannot be used.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Transitions will opt in to concurrent rendering, which allows the update to be interrupted. If the content re-suspends, transitions also tell React to continue showing the current content while rendering the transition content in the background (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Suspense RFC&lt;/a&gt; for more info).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Suspense lets you declaratively specify the loading state for a part of the component tree if it’s not yet ready to be displayed:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Suspense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;fallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Spinner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Suspense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suspense makes the “UI loading state” a first-class declarative concept in the React programming model. This lets us build higher-level features on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We introduced a limited version of Suspense several years ago. However, the only supported use case was code splitting with React.lazy, and it wasn’t supported at all when rendering on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In React 18, we’ve added support for Suspense on the server and expanded its capabilities using concurrent rendering features.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suspense in React 18 works best when combined with the transition API. If you suspend during a transition, React will prevent already-visible content from being replaced by a fallback. Instead, React will delay the render until enough data has loaded to prevent a bad loading state.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For more, see the RFC for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0213-suspense-in-react-18.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Suspense in React 18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In this release we took the opportunity to redesign the APIs we expose for rendering on the client and server. These changes allow users to continue using the old APIs in React 17 mode while they upgrade to the new APIs in React 18.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4 id=&quot;react-dom-client&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#react-dom-client&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;React DOM Client &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These new APIs are now exported from &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;react-dom/client&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createRoot&lt;/code&gt;: New method to create a root to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;unmount&lt;/code&gt;. Use it instead of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;ReactDOM.render&lt;/code&gt;. New features in React 18 don’t work without it.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;hydrateRoot&lt;/code&gt;: New method to hydrate a server rendered application. Use it instead of  &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;ReactDOM.hydrate&lt;/code&gt; in conjunction with the new React DOM Server APIs. New features in React 18 don’t work without it.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createRoot&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;hydrateRoot&lt;/code&gt; accept a new option called &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;onRecoverableError&lt;/code&gt; in case you want to be notified when React recovers from errors during rendering or hydration for logging. By default, React will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/reportError&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;reportError&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;console.error&lt;/code&gt; in the older browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;These new APIs are now exported from &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;react-dom/server&lt;/code&gt; and have full support for streaming Suspense on the server:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToPipeableStream&lt;/code&gt;: for streaming in Node environments.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToReadableStream&lt;/code&gt;: for modern edge runtime environments, such as Deno and Cloudflare workers.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The existing &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToString&lt;/code&gt; method keeps working but is discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In the future, we’d like to add a feature that allows React to add and remove sections of the UI while preserving state. For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to immediately show the previous screen. To do this, React would unmount and remount trees using the same component state as before.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This feature will give React apps better performance out-of-the-box, but requires components to be resilient to effects being mounted and destroyed multiple times. Most effects will work without any changes, but some effects assume they are only mounted or destroyed once.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To help surface these issues, React 18 introduces a new development-only check to Strict Mode. This new check will automatically unmount and remount every component, whenever a component mounts for the first time, restoring the previous state on the second mount.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before this change, React would mount the component and create the effects:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;* React mounts the component.
        * Layout effects are created.
        * Effects are created.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With Strict Mode in React 18, React will simulate unmounting and remounting the component in development mode:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;* React mounts the component.
        * Layout effects are created.
        * Effects are created.
        * React simulates unmounting the component.
        * Layout effects are destroyed.
        * Effects are destroyed.
        * React simulates mounting the component with the previous state.
        * Layout effects are created.

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useId&lt;/code&gt; is a new hook for generating unique IDs on both the client and server, while avoiding hydration mismatches. It is primarily useful for component libraries integrating with accessibility APIs that require unique IDs. This solves an issue that already exists in React 17 and below, but it’s even more important in React 18 because of how the new streaming server renderer delivers HTML out-of-order. &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/hooks-reference.html#useid&quot;&gt;See docs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useId&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; for generating &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys&quot;&gt;keys in a list&lt;/a&gt;. Keys should be generated from your data.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useTransition&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;startTransition&lt;/code&gt; let you mark some state updates as not urgent. Other state updates are considered urgent by default. React will allow urgent state updates (for example, updating a text input) to interrupt non-urgent state updates (for example, rendering a list of search results). &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/hooks-reference.html#usetransition&quot;&gt;See docs here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4 id=&quot;usedeferredvalue&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#usedeferredvalue&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;useDeferredValue &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useDeferredValue&lt;/code&gt; lets you defer re-rendering a non-urgent part of the tree. It is similar to debouncing, but has a few advantages compared to it. There is no fixed time delay, so React will attempt the deferred render right after the first render is reflected on the screen. The deferred render is interruptible and doesn’t block user input. &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/hooks-reference.html#usedeferredvalue&quot;&gt;See docs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h4 id=&quot;usesyncexternalstore&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#usesyncexternalstore&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;useSyncExternalStore &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useSyncExternalStore&lt;/code&gt; is a new hook that allows external stores to support concurrent reads by forcing updates to the store to be synchronous. It removes the need for useEffect when implementing subscriptions to external data sources, and is recommended for any library that integrates with state external to React. &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/hooks-reference.html#usesyncexternalstore&quot;&gt;See docs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useSyncExternalStore&lt;/code&gt; is intended to be used by libraries, not application code.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h4 id=&quot;useinsertioneffect&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#useinsertioneffect&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;useInsertionEffect &lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useInsertionEffect&lt;/code&gt; is a new hook that allows CSS-in-JS libraries to address performance issues of injecting styles in render. Unless you’ve already built a CSS-in-JS library we don’t expect you to ever use this. This hook will run after the DOM is mutated, but before layout effects read the new layout. This solves an issue that already exists in React 17 and below, but is even more important in React 18 because React yields to the browser during concurrent rendering, giving it a chance to recalculate layout. &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/hooks-reference.html#useinsertioneffect&quot;&gt;See docs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;startTransition&lt;/code&gt; as a version of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useTransition&lt;/code&gt; without pending feedback. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19696&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#19696&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rickhanlonii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@rickhanlonii&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Make Suspense remount layout effects when content reappears.

        &lt;li&gt;Make &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;StrictMode&gt;&lt;/code&gt; re-run effects to check for restorable state. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19523&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#19523&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/21418&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#21418&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bvaughn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@bvaughn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lunaruan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@lunaruan&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Assume Symbols are always available.

        &lt;li&gt;Remove &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;object-assign&lt;/code&gt; polyfill.

        &lt;li&gt;Remove unsupported &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;unstable_changedBits&lt;/code&gt; API.

        &lt;li&gt;Flush &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; resulting from discrete events like clicks synchronously. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/21150&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#21150&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acdlite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@acdlite&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Suspense &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;fallback={undefined}&lt;/code&gt; now behaves the same as &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; and isn’t ignored. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/21854&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#21854&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rickhanlonii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@rickhanlonii&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Consider all &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;lazy()&lt;/code&gt; resolving to the same component equivalent. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20357&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#20357&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sebmarkbage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@sebmarkbage&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Don’t patch console during first render.

        &lt;li&gt;Improve memory usage.

        &lt;li&gt;Improve messages if string coercion throws (Temporal.*, Symbol, etc.) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22064&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#22064&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justingrant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@justingrant&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;setImmediate&lt;/code&gt; when available over &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;MessageChannel&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20834&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;#20834&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gaearon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@gaearon&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;scary&quot;&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As we shared in the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html&quot;&gt;release post&lt;/a&gt;, React 18 introduces features powered by our new concurrent renderer, with a gradual adoption strategy for existing applications. In this post, we will guide you through the steps for upgrading to React 18.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/new/choose&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;report any issues&lt;/a&gt; you encounter while upgrading to React 18.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for React Native users: React 18 will ship in a future version of React Native. This is because React 18 relies on the New React Native Architecture to benefit from the new capabilities presented in this blogpost. For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ0cG47msEk&amp;#x26;t=1530s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;React Conf keynote here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;installing&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#installing&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Installing &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To install the latest version of React:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; react react-dom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Or if you’re using yarn:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; react react-dom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;updates-to-client-rendering-apis&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#updates-to-client-rendering-apis&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Updates to Client Rendering APIs &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you first install React 18, you will see a warning in the console:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it’s running React 17. Learn more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;React 18 introduces a new root API which provides better ergonomics for managing roots. The new root API also enables the new concurrent renderer, which allows you to opt-into concurrent features.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Before&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; render &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react-dom&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; container &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;home&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// After&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; createRoot &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react-dom/client&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; container &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; root &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// createRoot(container!) if you use TypeScript&lt;/span&gt;
        root&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;home&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve also changed &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;unmountComponentAtNode&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;root.unmount&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Before&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;unmountComponentAtNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// After&lt;/span&gt;
        root&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;unmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve also removed the callback from render, since it usually does not have the expected result when using Suspense:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Before&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; container &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;home&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;rendered&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// After&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;AppWithCallbackAfterRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;home&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; root &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        root&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;AppWithCallbackAfterRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is no one-to-one replacement for the old render callback API — it depends on your use case. See the working group post for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Replacing render with createRoot&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, if your app uses server-side rendering with hydration, upgrade &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;hydrate&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;hydrateRoot&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Before&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; hydrate &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react-dom&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; container &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hydrate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;home&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// After&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; hydrateRoot &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react-dom/client&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; container &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; root &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hydrateRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;container&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;home&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Unlike with createRoot, you don&apos;t need a separate root.render() call here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;working group discussion here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your app doesn’t work after upgrading, check whether it’s wrapped in &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;StrictMode&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#updates-to-strict-mode&quot;&gt;Strict Mode has gotten stricter in React 18&lt;/a&gt;, and not all your components may be resilient to the new checks it adds in development mode. If removing Strict Mode fixes your app, you can remove it during the upgrade, and then add it back (either at the top or for a part of the tree) after you fix the issues that it’s pointing out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;updates-to-server-rendering-apis&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#updates-to-server-rendering-apis&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Updates to Server Rendering APIs &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this release, we’re revamping our &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;react-dom/server&lt;/code&gt; APIs to fully support Suspense on the server and Streaming SSR. As part of these changes, we’re deprecating the old Node streaming API, which does not support incremental Suspense streaming on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Using this API will now warn:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToNodeStream&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Deprecated ⛔️️&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead, for streaming in Node environments, use:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToPipeableStream&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;New ✨&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re also introducing a new API to support streaming SSR with Suspense for modern edge runtime environments, such as Deno and Cloudflare workers:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToReadableStream&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;New ✨&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The following APIs will continue working, but with limited support for Suspense:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToString&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Limited&lt;/strong&gt; ⚠️&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToStaticMarkup&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Limited&lt;/strong&gt; ⚠️&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, this API will continue to work for rendering e-mails:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToStaticNodeStream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For more information on the changes to server rendering APIs, see the working group post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Upgrading to React 18 on the server&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;deep dive on the new Suspense SSR Architecture&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shaundai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Shaundai Person’s&lt;/a&gt; talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj5N-Khihgc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Streaming Server Rendering with Suspense&lt;/a&gt; at React Conf 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If your project uses TypeScript, you will need to update your &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;@types/react&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;@types/react-dom&lt;/code&gt; dependencies to the latest versions. The new types are safer and catch issues that used to be ignored by the type checker. The most notable change is that the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;children&lt;/code&gt; prop now needs to be listed explicitly when defining props, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight has-highlighted-lines&quot; data-language=&quot;typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;MyButtonProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        color&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;  children&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ReactNode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;React 18 adds out-of-the-box performance improvements by doing more batching by default. Batching is when React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. Before React 18, we only batched updates inside React event handlers. Updates inside of promises, setTimeout, native event handlers, or any other event were not batched in React by default:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Before React 18 only React events were batched&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setFlag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// React will only re-render once at the end (that&apos;s batching!)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setFlag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// React will render twice, once for each state update (no batching)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Starting in React 18 with &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createRoot&lt;/code&gt;, all updates will be automatically batched, no matter where they originate from. This means that updates inside of timeouts, promises, native event handlers or any other event will batch the same way as updates inside of React events:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// After React 18 updates inside of timeouts, promises,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a breaking change, but we expect this to result in less work rendering, and therefore better performance in your applications. To opt-out of automatic batching, you can use &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;flushSync&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; flushSync &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react-dom&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;flushSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In the React 18 Working Group we worked with library maintainers to create new APIs needed to support concurrent rendering for use cases specific to their use case in areas like styles, and external stores. To support React 18, some libraries may need to switch to one of the following APIs:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useSyncExternalStore&lt;/code&gt; is a new hook that allows external stores to support concurrent reads by forcing updates to the store to be synchronous. This new API is recommended for any library that integrates with state external to React. For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/70&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;useSyncExternalStore overview post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/86&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;useSyncExternalStore API details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useInsertionEffect&lt;/code&gt; is a new hook that allows CSS-in-JS libraries to address performance issues of injecting styles in render. Unless you’ve already built a CSS-in-JS library we don’t expect you to ever use this. This hook will run after the DOM is mutated, but before layout effects read the new layout. This solves an issue that already exists in React 17 and below, but is even more important in React 18 because React yields to the browser during concurrent rendering, giving it a chance to recalculate layout. For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/110&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Library Upgrade Guide for &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;style&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;React 18 also introduces new APIs for concurrent rendering such as &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;startTransition&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useDeferredValue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useId&lt;/code&gt;, which we share more about in the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html&quot;&gt;release post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;updates-to-strict-mode&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#updates-to-strict-mode&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Updates to Strict Mode &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the future, we’d like to add a feature that allows React to add and remove sections of the UI while preserving state. For example, when a user tabs away from a screen and back, React should be able to immediately show the previous screen. To do this, React would unmount and remount trees using the same component state as before.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This feature will give React better performance out-of-the-box, but requires components to be resilient to effects being mounted and destroyed multiple times. Most effects will work without any changes, but some effects assume they are only mounted or destroyed once.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To help surface these issues, React 18 introduces a new development-only check to Strict Mode. This new check will automatically unmount and remount every component, whenever a component mounts for the first time, restoring the previous state on the second mount.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before this change, React would mount the component and create the effects:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;* React mounts the component.
        * Layout effects are created.
        * Effect effects are created.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With Strict Mode in React 18, React will simulate unmounting and remounting the component in development mode:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;* React mounts the component.
        * Layout effects are created.
        * Effect effects are created.
        * React simulates unmounting the component.
        * Layout effects are destroyed.
        * Effects are destroyed.
        * React simulates mounting the component with the previous state.
        * Layout effect setup code runs
        * Effect setup code runs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When you first update your tests to use &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createRoot&lt;/code&gt;, you may see this warning in your test console:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The current testing environment is not configured to support act(…)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To fix this, set &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;globalThis.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; before running your test:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// In your test setup file&lt;/span&gt;
        globalThis&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The purpose of the flag is to tell React that it’s running in a unit test-like environment. React will log helpful warnings if you forget to wrap an update with &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;act&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can also set the flag to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; to tell React that &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;act&lt;/code&gt; isn’t needed. This can be useful for end-to-end tests that simulate a full browser environment.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Eventually, we expect testing libraries will configure this for you automatically. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/issues/509#issuecomment-917989936&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;next version of React Testing Library has built-in support for React 18&lt;/a&gt; without any additional configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In this release, React is dropping support for Internet Explorer, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/05/19/the-future-of-internet-explorer-on-windows-10-is-in-microsoft-edge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;going out of support on June 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. We’re making this change now because new features introduced in React 18 are built using modern browser features such as microtasks which cannot be adequately polyfilled in IE.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you need to support Internet Explorer we recommend you stay with React 17.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&quot;other-breaking-changes&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#other-breaking-changes&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other Breaking Changes &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent useEffect timing&lt;/strong&gt;: React now always synchronously flushes effect functions if the update was triggered during a discrete user input event such as a click or a keydown event. Previously, the behavior wasn’t always predictable or consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stricter hydration errors&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydration mismatches due to missing or extra text content are now treated like errors instead of warnings. React will no longer attempt to “patch up” individual nodes by inserting or deleting a node on the client in an attempt to match the server markup, and will revert to client rendering up to the closest &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Suspense&gt;&lt;/code&gt; boundary in the tree. This ensures the hydrated tree is consistent and avoids potential privacy and security holes that can be caused by hydration mismatches.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspense trees are always consistent:&lt;/strong&gt; If a component suspends before it’s fully added to the tree, React will not add it to the tree in an incomplete state or fire its effects. Instead, React will throw away the new tree completely, wait for the asynchronous operation to finish, and then retry rendering again from scratch. React will render the retry attempt concurrently, and without blocking the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layout Effects with Suspense&lt;/strong&gt;: When a tree re-suspends and reverts to a fallback, React will now clean up layout effects, and then re-create them when the content inside the boundary is shown again. This fixes an issue which prevented component libraries from correctly measuring layout when used with Suspense.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New JS Environment Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;: React now depends on modern browsers features including &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;Symbol&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;Object.assign&lt;/code&gt;. If you support older browsers and devices such as Internet Explorer which do not provide modern browser features natively or have non-compliant implementations, consider including a global polyfill in your bundled application.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;other-notable-changes&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#other-notable-changes&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other Notable Changes &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;react&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#react&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;React &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components can now render &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; React no longer warns if you return &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; from a component. This makes the allowed component return values consistent with values that are allowed in the middle of a component tree. We suggest to use a linter to prevent mistakes like forgetting a &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement before JSX.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In tests, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;act&lt;/code&gt; warnings are now opt-in:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re running end-to-end tests, the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;act&lt;/code&gt; warnings are unnecessary. We’ve introduced an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/102&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;opt-in&lt;/a&gt; mechanism so you can enable them only for unit tests where they are useful and beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No warning about &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; on unmounted components:&lt;/strong&gt; Previously, React warned about memory leaks when you call &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; on an unmounted component. This warning was added for subscriptions, but people primarily run into it in scenarios where setting state is fine, and workarounds make the code worse. We’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/22114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; this warning.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No suppression of console logs:&lt;/strong&gt; When you use Strict Mode, React renders each component twice to help you find unexpected side effects. In React 17, we’ve suppressed console logs for one of the two renders to make the logs easier to read. In response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/21783&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;community feedback&lt;/a&gt; about this being confusing, we’ve removed the suppression. Instead, if you have React DevTools installed, the second log’s renders will be displayed in grey, and there will be an option (off by default) to suppress them completely.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved memory usage:&lt;/strong&gt; React now cleans up more internal fields on unmount, making the impact from unfixed memory leaks that may exist in your application code less severe.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;react-dom-server&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#react-dom-server&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;React DOM Server &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToString&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Will no longer error when suspending on the server. Instead, it will emit the fallback HTML for the closest &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Suspense&gt;&lt;/code&gt; boundary and then retry rendering the same content on the client. It is still recommended that you switch to a streaming API like &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToPipeableStream&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToReadableStream&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;renderToStaticMarkup&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Will no longer error when suspending on the server. Instead, it will emit the fallback HTML for the closest &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Suspense&gt;&lt;/code&gt; boundary.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Last week we hosted our 6th React Conf.  In previous years, we’ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.fb.com/2015/03/26/android/react-native-bringing-modern-web-techniques-to-mobile/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;React Native&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;React Hooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All the talks are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ0cG47msEk&amp;#x26;list=PLNG_1j3cPCaZZ7etkzWA7JfdmKWT0pMsa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;available to stream online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here’s a summary of what was shared on stage:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;react-18-and-concurrent-features&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#react-18-and-concurrent-features&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;React 18 and concurrent features &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the keynote, we shared our vision for the future of React starting with React 18.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;React 18 adds the long-awaited concurrent renderer and updates to Suspense without any major breaking changes. Apps can upgrade to React 18 and begin gradually adopting concurrent features with the amount of effort on par with any other major release.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means there is no concurrent mode, only concurrent features.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the keynote, we also shared our vision for Suspense, Server Components, new React working groups, and our long-term many-platform vision for React Native.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In the keynote, we also announced that the React 18 RC is available to try now. Pending further feedback, this is the exact version of React that we will publish to stable early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To try the React 18 RC, upgrade your dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; react@rc react-dom@rc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and switch to the new &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createRoot&lt;/code&gt; API:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;React 18 also includes improvements to server-side rendering performance using Suspense.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Streaming server rendering lets you generate HTML from React components on the server, and stream that HTML to your users. In React 18, you can use &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;Suspense&lt;/code&gt; to break down your app into smaller independent units which can be streamed independently of each other without blocking the rest of the app. This means users will see your content sooner and be able to start interacting with it much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For React 18, we created our first Working Group to collaborate with a panel of experts, developers, library maintainers, and educators. Together we worked to create our gradual adoption strategy and refine new APIs such as &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useId&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useSyncExternalStore&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useInsertionEffect&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This was our first year planning a conference ourselves, and we have a lot of people to thank.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, thanks to all of our speakers &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aakansha1216&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Aakansha Doshi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acdlite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Andrew Clark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brian Vaughn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dai_shi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Daishi Kato&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/debs_obrien&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Debbie O’Brien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Delba de Oliveira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/diegohaz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Diego Haz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EricRozell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Eric Rozell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wizardlyhel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Helen Lin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_jstejada&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Juan Tejada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/potetotes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lauren Tan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lintonye&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Linton Ye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lyle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lyle Troxell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelnabors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rachel Nabors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rick Hanlon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StatisticsFTW&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Robert Balicki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raedle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Roman Rädle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarah11918&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sarah Rainsberger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shaundai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Shaundai Person&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shrutikapoor08&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Shruti Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/moyessa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Steven Moyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hawaiiman0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tafu Nakazaki&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Huxpro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Xuan Huang (黄玄)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Update Nov. 15th, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;React 18 is now in beta. More information about the status of the release is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;available in the React 18 Working Group post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The React team is excited to share a few updates:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;We’ve started work on the React 18 release, which will be our next major version.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;We’ve created a Working Group to prepare the community for gradual adoption of new features in React 18.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;We’ve published a React 18 Alpha so that library authors can try it and provide feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These updates are primarily aimed at maintainers of third-party libraries. If you’re learning, teaching, or using React to build user-facing applications, you can safely ignore this post. But you are welcome to follow the discussions in the React 18 Working Group if you’re curious!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-coming-in-react-18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whats-coming-in-react-18&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What’s coming in React 18 &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it’s released, React 18 will include out-of-the-box improvements (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;automatic batching&lt;/a&gt;), new APIs (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/41&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;startTransition&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;new streaming server renderer&lt;/a&gt; with built-in support for &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.lazy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These features are possible thanks to a new opt-in mechanism we’re adding in React 18. It’s called “concurrent rendering” and it lets React prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time. This change is mostly behind-the-scenes, but it unlocks new possibilities to improve both real and perceived performance of your app.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’ve been following our research into the future of React (we don’t expect you to!), you might have heard of something called “concurrent mode” or that it might break your app. In response to this feedback from the community, we’ve redesigned the upgrade strategy for gradual adoption. Instead of an all-or-nothing “mode”, concurrent rendering will only be enabled for updates triggered by one of the new features. In practice, this means &lt;strong&gt;you will be able to adopt React 18 without rewrites and try the new features at your own pace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-gradual-adoption-strategy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#a-gradual-adoption-strategy&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A gradual adoption strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since concurrency in React 18 is opt-in, there are no significant out-of-the-box breaking changes to component behavior. &lt;strong&gt;You can upgrade to React 18 with minimal or no changes to your application code, with a level of effort comparable to a typical major React release&lt;/strong&gt;. Based on our experience converting several apps to React 18, we expect that many users will be able to upgrade within a single afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We successfully shipped concurrent features to tens of thousands of components at Facebook, and in our experience, we’ve found that most React components “just work” without additional changes. We’re committed to making sure this is a smooth upgrade for the entire community, so today we’re announcing the React 18 Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-the-community&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#working-with-the-community&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Working with the community &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re trying something new for this release: We’ve invited a panel of experts, developers, library authors, and educators from across the React community to participate in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;React 18 Working Group&lt;/a&gt; to provide feedback, ask questions, and collaborate on the release. We couldn’t invite everyone we wanted to this initial, small group, but if this experiment works out, we hope there will be more in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The goal of the React 18 Working Group is to prepare the ecosystem for a smooth, gradual adoption of React 18 by existing applications and libraries.&lt;/strong&gt; The Working Group is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;GitHub Discussions&lt;/a&gt; and is available for the public to read. Members of the working group can leave feedback, ask questions, and share ideas. The core team will also use the discussions repo to share our research findings. As the stable release gets closer, any important information will also be posted on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Everyone can read the discussions in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactwg/react-18&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;React 18 Working Group repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because we expect an initial surge of interest in the Working Group, only invited members will be allowed to create or comment on threads. However, the threads are fully visible to the public, so everyone has access to the same information. We believe this is a good compromise between creating a productive environment for working group members, while maintaining transparency with the wider community.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As always, you can submit bug reports, questions, and general feedback to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These releases are built using the most recent commit to our main repo. When a feature or bugfix is merged, it will appear in an alpha the following weekday.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There may be significant behavioral or API changes between alpha releases. Please remember that &lt;strong&gt;alpha releases are not recommended for user-facing, production applications&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We don’t have a specific release date scheduled, but we expect it will take several months of feedback and iteration before React 18 is ready for most production applications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Library Alpha: Available today&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Public Beta: At least several months&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Release Candidate (RC): At least several weeks after Beta&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;General Availability: At least several weeks after RC&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2020 has been a long year. As it comes to an end we wanted to share a special Holiday Update on our research into zero-bundle-size &lt;strong&gt;React Server Components&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To introduce React Server Components, we have prepared a talk and a demo. If you want, you can check them out during the holidays, or later when work picks back up in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; &quot; &gt; &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQQPAU21ZUw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; style=&quot; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Server Components are still in research and development.&lt;/strong&gt; We are sharing this work in the spirit of transparency and to get initial feedback from the React community. There will be plenty of time for that, so &lt;strong&gt;don’t feel like you have to catch up right now!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to check them out, we recommend to go in the following order:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the talk&lt;/strong&gt; to learn about React Server Components and see the demo.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are excited to hear from you on the RFC or in replies to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/reactjs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@reactjs&lt;/a&gt; Twitter handle. Happy holidays, stay safe, and see you next year!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today, we are releasing React 17! We’ve written at length about the role of the React 17 release and the changes it contains in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html&quot;&gt;the React 17 RC blog post&lt;/a&gt;. This post is a brief summary of it, so if you’ve already read the RC post, you can skip this one.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-new-features&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#no-new-features&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;No New Features &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The React 17 release is unusual because it doesn’t add any new developer-facing features. Instead, this release is primarily focused on &lt;strong&gt;making it easier to upgrade React itself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In particular, React 17 is a “stepping stone” release that makes it safer to embed a tree managed by one version of React inside a tree managed by a different version of React.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It also makes it easier to embed React into apps built with other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;gradual-upgrades&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#gradual-upgrades&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gradual Upgrades &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React 17 enables gradual React upgrades.&lt;/strong&gt; When you upgrade from React 15 to 16 (or, this time, from React 16 to 17), you would usually upgrade your whole app at once. This works well for many apps. But it can get increasingly challenging if the codebase was written more than a few years ago and isn’t actively maintained. And while it’s possible to use two versions of React on the page, until React 17 this has been fragile and caused problems with events.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re fixing many of those problems with React 17. This means that &lt;strong&gt;when React 18 and the next future versions come out, you will now have more options&lt;/strong&gt;. The first option will be to upgrade your whole app at once, like you might have done before. But you will also have an option to upgrade your app piece by piece. For example, you might decide to migrate most of your app to React 18, but keep some lazy-loaded dialog or a subroute on React 17.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean you &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; do gradual upgrades. &lt;strong&gt;For most apps, upgrading all at once is still the best solution.&lt;/strong&gt; Loading two versions of React — even if one of them is loaded lazily on demand — is still not ideal. However, for larger apps that aren’t actively maintained, this option makes sense to consider, and React 17 lets those apps not get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve prepared an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/react-gradual-upgrade-demo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;example repository&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating how to lazy-load an older version of React if necessary. This demo uses Create React App, but it should be possible to follow a similar approach with any other tool. We welcome demos using other tooling as pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve &lt;strong&gt;postponed other changes&lt;/strong&gt; until after React 17. The goal of this release is to enable gradual upgrades. If upgrading to React 17 were too difficult, it would defeat its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;changes-to-event-delegation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#changes-to-event-delegation&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Changes to Event Delegation &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To enable gradual updates, we’ve needed to make some changes to the React event system. React 17 is a major release because these changes are potentially breaking. You can check out our &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/faq-versioning.html#breaking-changes&quot;&gt;versioning FAQ&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about our commitment to stability.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In React 17, React will no longer attach event handlers at the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; level under the hood. Instead, it will attach them to the root DOM container into which your React tree is rendered:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; rootNode &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;root&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        ReactDOM&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; rootNode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In React 16 and earlier, React would do &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document.addEventListener()&lt;/code&gt; for most events. React 17 will call &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;rootNode.addEventListener()&lt;/code&gt; under the hood instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’ve only had to change fewer than twenty components out of 100,000+ in the Facebook product code to work with these changes, so &lt;strong&gt;we expect that most apps can upgrade to React 17 without too much trouble&lt;/strong&gt;.

        &lt;p&gt;React 17 supports the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html&quot;&gt;new JSX transform&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve also backported support for it to React 16.14.0, React 15.7.0, and 0.14.10. Note that it is completely opt-in, and you don’t have to use it. The classic JSX transform will keep working, and there are no plans to stop supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;React Native has a separate release schedule. We landed the support for React 17 in React Native 0.64. As always, you can track the release discussions on the React Native Community releases &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/react-native-community/releases&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;scary&quot;&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although React 17 &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html&quot;&gt;doesn’t contain new features&lt;/a&gt;, it will provide support for a new version of the JSX transform. In this post, we will describe what it is and how to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-a-jsx-transform&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whats-a-jsx-transform&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What’s a JSX Transform? &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Browsers don’t understand JSX out of the box, so most React users rely on a compiler like Babel or TypeScript to &lt;strong&gt;transform JSX code into regular JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;. Many preconfigured toolkits like Create React App or Next.js also include a JSX transform under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Together with the React 17 release, we’ve wanted to make a few improvements to the JSX transform, but we didn’t want to break existing setups. This is why we &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/blog/2020/03/16/7.9.0#a-new-jsx-transform-11154httpsgithubcombabelbabelpull11154&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;worked with Babel&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;offer a new, rewritten version of the JSX transform&lt;/strong&gt; for people who would like to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Upgrading to the new transform is completely optional, but it has a few benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;With the new transform, you can &lt;strong&gt;use JSX without importing React&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Depending on your setup, its compiled output may &lt;strong&gt;slightly improve the bundle size&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;It will enable future improvements that &lt;strong&gt;reduce the number of concepts&lt;/strong&gt; you need to learn React.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This upgrade will not change the JSX syntax and is not required.&lt;/strong&gt; The old JSX transform will keep working as usual, and there are no plans to remove the support for it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html&quot;&gt;React 17 RC&lt;/a&gt; already includes support for the new transform, so go give it a try! To make it easier to adopt, &lt;strong&gt;we’ve also backported its support&lt;/strong&gt; to React 16.14.0, React 15.7.0, and React 0.14.10. You can find the upgrade instructions for different tools &lt;a href=&quot;#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a closer look at the differences between the old and the new transform.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-different-in-the-new-transform&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whats-different-in-the-new-transform&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What’s Different in the New Transform? &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you use JSX, the compiler transforms it into React function calls that the browser can understand. &lt;strong&gt;The old JSX transform&lt;/strong&gt; turned JSX into &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.createElement(...)&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say your source code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the old JSX transform turns it into regular JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;h1&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hello world&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your source code doesn’t need to change in any way.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re describing how the JSX transform turns your JSX source code into the JavaScript code a browser can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, this is not perfect:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Because JSX was compiled into &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.createElement&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React&lt;/code&gt; needed to be in scope if you used JSX.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;There are some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/createlement-rfc/text/0000-create-element-changes.md#motivation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;performance improvements and simplifications&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.createElement&lt;/code&gt; does not allow.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To solve these issues, React 17 introduces two new entry points to the React package that are intended to only be used by compilers like Babel and TypeScript. Instead of transforming JSX to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.createElement&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the new JSX transform&lt;/strong&gt; automatically imports special functions from those new entry points in the React package and calls them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let’s say that your source code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is what the new JSX transform compiles it to:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Inserted by a compiler (don&apos;t import it yourself!)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;jsx &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; _jsx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react/jsx-runtime&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_jsx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;h1&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hello world&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note how our original code &lt;strong&gt;did not need to import React&lt;/strong&gt; to use JSX anymore! (But we would still need to import React in order to use Hooks or other exports that React provides.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This change is fully compatible with all of the existing JSX code&lt;/strong&gt;, so you won’t have to change your components. If you’re curious, you can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/createlement-rfc/text/0000-create-element-changes.md#detailed-design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;technical RFC&lt;/a&gt; for more details about how the new transform works.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The functions inside &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;react/jsx-runtime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;react/jsx-dev-runtime&lt;/code&gt; must only be used by the compiler transform. If you need to manually create elements in your code, you should keep using &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.createElement&lt;/code&gt;. It will continue to work and is not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you aren’t ready to upgrade to the new JSX transform or if you are using JSX for another library, don’t worry. The old transform will not be removed and will continue to be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to upgrade, you will need two things:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A version of React that supports the new transform&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html&quot;&gt;React 17 RC&lt;/a&gt; and higher supports it, but we’ve also released React 16.14.0, React 15.7.0, and React 0.14.10 for people who are still on the older major versions).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A compatible compiler&lt;/strong&gt; (see instructions for different tools below).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since the new JSX transform doesn’t require React to be in scope, &lt;a href=&quot;#removing-unused-react-imports&quot;&gt;we’ve also prepared an automated script&lt;/a&gt; that will remove the unnecessary imports from your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;create-react-app&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#create-react-app&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Create React App &lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Support for the new JSX transform is available in Babel &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/blog/2020/03/16/7.9.0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;v7.9.0&lt;/a&gt; and above.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, you’ll need to update to the latest Babel and plugin transform.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# for npm users&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; update @babel/core @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# for yarn users&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/span&gt; upgrade @babel/core @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;@babel/preset-react&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# for npm users&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; update @babel/core @babel/preset-react&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# for yarn users&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;yarn&lt;/span&gt; upgrade @babel/core @babel/preset-react&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Currently, the old transform &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;{&quot;runtime&quot;: &quot;classic&quot;}&lt;/code&gt; is the default option. To enable the new transform, you can pass &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;{&quot;runtime&quot;: &quot;automatic&quot;}&lt;/code&gt; as an option to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;@babel/preset-react&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// If you are using @babel/preset-react&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;presets&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;@babel/preset-react&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;runtime&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;automatic&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// If you&apos;re using @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;plugins&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&quot;runtime&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;automatic&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Starting from Babel 8, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&quot;automatic&quot;&lt;/code&gt; will be the default runtime for both plugins. For more information, check out the Babel documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@babel/preset-react&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you use JSX with a library other than React, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#importsource&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;importSource&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/a&gt; to import from that library instead — as long as it provides the necessary entry points. Alternatively, you can keep using the classic transform which will continue to be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’re a library author and you are implementing the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;/jsx-runtime&lt;/code&gt; entry point for your library, keep in mind that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20031#issuecomment-710346866&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;there is a case&lt;/a&gt; in which even the new transform has to fall back to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt; for backwards compatibility. In that case, it will auto-import &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt; directly from the &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; entry point specified by &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;importSource&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Flow supports the new JSX transform in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/flow/releases/tag/v0.126.0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;v0.126.0&lt;/a&gt; and up, by adding &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;react.runtime=automatic&lt;/code&gt; to your Flow configuration options. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Because the new JSX transform will automatically import the necessary &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;react/jsx-runtime&lt;/code&gt; functions, React will no longer need to be in scope when you use JSX. This might lead to unused React imports in your code. It doesn’t hurt to keep them, but if you’d like to remove them, we recommend running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;“codemod”&lt;/a&gt; script to remove them automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; your_project
        npx react-codemod update-react-imports&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’re getting errors when running the codemod, try specifying a different JavaScript dialect when &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;npx react-codemod update-react-imports&lt;/code&gt; asks you to choose one. In particular, at this moment the “JavaScript with Flow” setting supports newer syntax than the “JavaScript” setting even if you don’t use Flow. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod/issues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;File an issue&lt;/a&gt; if you run into problems.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the codemod output will not always match your project’s coding style, so you might want to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://prettier.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Prettier&lt;/a&gt; after the codemod finishes for consistent formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Running this codemod will:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Remove all unused React imports as a result of upgrading to the new JSX transform.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Change all default React imports (i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;import React from &quot;react&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) to destructured named imports (ex. &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;import { useState } from &quot;react&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) which is the preferred style going into the future. This codemod &lt;strong&gt;will not&lt;/strong&gt; affect the existing namespace imports (i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;import * as React from &quot;react&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) which is also a valid style. The default imports will keep working in React 17, but in the longer term we encourage moving away from them.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;will be replaced with&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you use some other import from React — for example, a Hook — then the codemod will convert it to a named import.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; React &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; setText&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hello World&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; setText&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Hello World&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In addition to cleaning up unused imports, this will also help you prepare for a future major version of React (not React 17) which will support ES Modules and not have a default export.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;scary&quot;&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today, we are publishing the first Release Candidate for React 17. It has been two and a half years since &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html&quot;&gt;the previous major release of React&lt;/a&gt;, which is a long time even by our standards! In this blog post, we will describe the role of this major release, what changes you can expect in it, and how you can try this release.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;no-new-features&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#no-new-features&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;No New Features &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The React 17 release is unusual because it doesn’t add any new developer-facing features. Instead, this release is primarily focused on &lt;strong&gt;making it easier to upgrade React itself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re actively working on the new React features, but they’re not a part of this release. The React 17 release is a key part of our strategy to roll them out without leaving anyone behind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In particular, &lt;strong&gt;React 17 is a “stepping stone” release&lt;/strong&gt; that makes it safer to embed a tree managed by one version of React inside a tree managed by a different version of React.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;gradual-upgrades&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#gradual-upgrades&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gradual Upgrades &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the past seven years, React upgrades have been “all-or-nothing”. Either you stay on an old version, or you upgrade your whole app to a new version. There was no in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This has worked out so far, but we are running into the limits of the “all-or-nothing” upgrade strategy. Some API changes, for example, deprecating the &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/legacy-context.html&quot;&gt;legacy context API&lt;/a&gt;, are impossible to do in an automated way. Even though most apps written today don’t ever use them, we still support them in React. We have to choose between supporting them in React indefinitely or leaving some apps behind on an old version of React. Both of these options aren’t great.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So we wanted to provide another option.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React 17 enables gradual React upgrades.&lt;/strong&gt; When you upgrade from React 15 to 16 (or, soon, from React 16 to 17), you would usually upgrade your whole app at once. This works well for many apps. But it can get increasingly challenging if the codebase was written more than a few years ago and isn’t actively maintained. And while it’s possible to use two versions of React on the page, until React 17 this has been fragile and caused problems with events.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re fixing many of those problems with React 17. This means that &lt;strong&gt;when React 18 and the next future versions come out, you will now have more options&lt;/strong&gt;. The first option will be to upgrade your whole app at once, like you might have done before. But you will also have an option to upgrade your app piece by piece. For example, you might decide to migrate most of your app to React 18, but keep some lazy-loaded dialog or a subroute on React 17.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean you &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; do gradual upgrades. For most apps, upgrading all at once is still the best solution. Loading two versions of React — even if one of them is loaded lazily on demand — is still not ideal. However, for larger apps that aren’t actively maintained, this option may make sense to consider, and React 17 enables those apps to not get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To enable gradual updates, we’ve needed to make some changes to the React event system. React 17 is a major release because these changes are potentially breaking. In practice, we’ve only had to change fewer than twenty components out of 100,000+ so &lt;strong&gt;we expect that most apps can upgrade to React 17 without too much trouble&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tell us&lt;/a&gt; if you run into problems.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’ve prepared an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/react-gradual-upgrade-demo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;example repository&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating how to lazy-load an older version of React if necessary. This demo uses Create React App, but it should be possible to follow a similar approach with any other tool. We welcome demos using other tooling as pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve &lt;strong&gt;postponed other changes&lt;/strong&gt; until after React 17. The goal of this release is to enable gradual upgrades. If upgrading to React 17 were too difficult, it would defeat its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Technically, it has always been possible to nest apps developed with different versions of React. However, it was rather fragile because of how the React event system worked.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In React components, you usually write event handlers inline:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;handleClick&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The vanilla DOM equivalent to this code is something like:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;myButton&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; handleClick&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, for most events, React doesn’t actually attach them to the DOM nodes on which you declare them. Instead, React attaches one handler per event type directly at the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; node. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;event delegation&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to its performance benefits on large application trees, it also makes it easier to add new features like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1200118229697486849&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;replaying events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;React has been doing event delegation automatically since its first release. When a DOM event fires on the document, React figures out which component to call, and then the React event “bubbles” upwards through your components. But behind the scenes, the native event has already bubbled up to the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; level, where React installs its event handlers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, this is a problem for gradual upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you have multiple React versions on the page, they all register event handlers at the top. This breaks &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;e.stopPropagation()&lt;/code&gt;: if a nested tree has stopped propagation of an event, the outer tree would still receive it. This made it difficult to nest different versions of React. This concern is not hypothetical — for example, the Atom editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;ran into this&lt;/a&gt; four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is why we’re changing how React attaches events to the DOM under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In React 17, React will no longer attach event handlers at the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; level. Instead, it will attach them to the root DOM container into which your React tree is rendered:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; rootNode &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;root&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        ReactDOM&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; rootNode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In React 16 and earlier, React would do &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document.addEventListener()&lt;/code&gt; for most events. React 17 will call &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;rootNode.addEventListener()&lt;/code&gt; under the hood instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thanks to this change, &lt;strong&gt;it is now safer to embed a React tree managed by one version inside a tree managed by a different React version&lt;/strong&gt;. Note that for this to work, both of the versions would need to be 17 or higher, which is why upgrading to React 17 is important. In a way, React 17 is a “stepping stone” release that makes next gradual upgrades feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This change also &lt;strong&gt;makes it easier to embed React into apps built with other technologies&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, if the outer “shell” of your app is written in jQuery, but the newer code inside of it is written with React, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;e.stopPropagation()&lt;/code&gt; inside the React code would now prevent it from reaching the jQuery code — as you would expect. This also works in the other direction. If you no longer like React and want to rewrite your app — for example, in jQuery — you can start converting the outer shell from React to jQuery without breaking the event propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You might be wondering whether this breaks &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/portals.html&quot;&gt;Portals&lt;/a&gt; outside of the root container. The answer is that React &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; listens to events on portal containers, so this is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As with any breaking change, it is likely some code would need to be adjusted. At Facebook, we had to adjust about 10 modules in total (out of many thousands) to work with this change.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, if you add manual DOM listeners with &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document.addEventListener(...)&lt;/code&gt;, you might expect them to catch all React events. In React 16 and earlier, even if you call &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;e.stopPropagation()&lt;/code&gt; in a React event handler, your custom &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; listeners would still receive them because the native event is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; at the document level. With React 17, the propagation &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; stop (as requested!), so your &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; handlers would not fire:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// This custom handler will no longer receive clicks&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// from React components that called e.stopPropagation()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can fix code like this by converting your listener to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing#capturing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;capture phase&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, you can pass &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;{ capture: true }&lt;/code&gt; as the third argument to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;document.addEventListener&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;click&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Now this event handler uses the capture phase,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// so it receives *all* click events below!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note how this strategy is more resilient overall — for example, it will probably fix existing bugs in your code that happen when &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;e.stopPropagation()&lt;/code&gt; is called outside of a React event handler. In other words, &lt;strong&gt;event propagation in React 17 works closer to the regular DOM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’ve kept the breaking changes in React 17 to the minimum. For example, it doesn’t remove any of the methods that have been deprecated in the previous releases. However, it does include a few other breaking changes that have been relatively safe in our experience. In total, we’ve had to adjust fewer than 20 out of 100,000+ our components because of them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;aligning-with-browsers&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#aligning-with-browsers&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Aligning with Browsers &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve made a couple of smaller changes related to the event system:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;onScroll&lt;/code&gt; event &lt;strong&gt;no longer bubbles&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15723&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;common confusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;React &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;onFocus&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;onBlur&lt;/code&gt; events have switched to using the native &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;focusin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;focusout&lt;/code&gt; events under the hood, which more closely match React’s existing behavior and sometimes provide extra information.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Capture phase events (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;onClickCapture&lt;/code&gt;) now use real browser capture phase listeners.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These changes align React closer with the browser behavior and improve interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although React 17 switched from &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;focusin&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;under the hood&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;onFocus&lt;/code&gt; event, note that this has &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; affected the bubbling behavior. In React, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;onFocus&lt;/code&gt; event has always bubbled, and it continues to do so in React 17 because generally it is a more useful default. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://codesandbox.io/s/strange-albattani-7tqr7?file=/src/App.js&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this sandbox&lt;/a&gt; for the different checks you can add for different particular use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;no-event-pooling&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#no-event-pooling&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;No Event Pooling &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;React 17 removes the “event pooling” optimization from React. It doesn’t improve performance in modern browsers and confuses even experienced React users:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;handleChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// This crashes in React 16 and earlier:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is because React reused the event objects between different events for performance in old browsers, and set all event fields to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; in between them. With React 16 and earlier, you have to call &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;e.persist()&lt;/code&gt; to properly use the event, or read the property you need earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In React 17, this code works as you would expect. The old event pooling optimization has been fully removed, so you can read the event fields whenever you need them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a behavior change, which is why we’re marking it as breaking, but in practice we haven’t seen it break anything at Facebook. (Maybe it even fixed a few bugs!) Note that &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;e.persist()&lt;/code&gt; is still available on the React event object, but now it doesn’t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We are making the timing of the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; cleanup function more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight has-highlighted-lines&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// This is the effect itself.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// This is its cleanup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-highlight-code-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most effects don’t need to delay screen updates, so React runs them asynchronously soon after the update has been reflected on the screen. (For the rare cases where you need an effect to block paint, e.g. to measure and position a tooltip, prefer &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useLayoutEffect&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, when a component is unmounting, effect &lt;em&gt;cleanup&lt;/em&gt; functions used to run synchronously (similar to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/code&gt; being synchronous in classes). We’ve found that this is not ideal for larger apps because it slows down large screen transitions (e.g. switching tabs).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In React 17, the effect cleanup function always runs asynchronously — for example, if the component is unmounting, the cleanup runs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the screen has been updated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This mirrors how the effects themselves run more closely. In the rare cases where you might want to rely on the synchronous execution, you can switch to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useLayoutEffect&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You might be wondering whether this means that you’ll now be unable to fix warnings about &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; on unmounted components. Don’t worry — React specifically checks for this case, and does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fire &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; warnings in the short gap between unmounting and the cleanup. &lt;strong&gt;So code cancelling requests or intervals can almost always stay the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, React 17 will always execute all effect cleanup functions (for all components) before it runs any new effects. React 16 only guaranteed this ordering for effects within a component.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’ve only seen a couple of components break with this change, although reusable libraries may need to test it more thoroughly. One example of problematic code may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        someRef&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;current&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;someSetupMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        someRef&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;current&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;someCleanupMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The problem is that &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;someRef.current&lt;/code&gt; is mutable, so by the time the cleanup function runs, it may have been set to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. The solution is to capture any mutable values &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the effect:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; instance &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; someRef&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;current&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;someSetupMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;someCleanupMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We don’t expect this to be a common problem because &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;our &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;eslint-plugin-react-hooks/exhaustive-deps&lt;/code&gt; lint rule&lt;/a&gt; (make sure you use it!) has always warned about this.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;consistent-errors-for-returning-undefined&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#consistent-errors-for-returning-undefined&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Consistent Errors for Returning Undefined &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In React 16 and earlier, returning &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; has always been an error:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Error: Nothing was returned from render&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is in part because it’s easy to return &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; unintentionally:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// We forgot to write return, so this component returns undefined.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// React surfaces this as an error instead of ignoring it.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Previously, React only did this for class and function components, but did not check the return values of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;forwardRef&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/code&gt; components. This was due to a coding mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In React 17, the behavior for &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;forwardRef&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/code&gt; components is consistent with regular function and class components. Returning &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; from them is an error.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; Button &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// We forgot to write return, so this component returns undefined.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// React 17 surfaces this as an error instead of ignoring it.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; Button &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// We forgot to write return, so this component returns undefined.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// React 17 surfaces this as an error instead of ignoring it.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the cases where you want to render nothing intentionally, return &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;native-component-stacks&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#native-component-stacks&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Native Component Stacks &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you throw an error in the browser, the browser gives you a stack trace with JavaScript function names and their locations. However, JavaScript stacks are often not enough to diagnose a problem because the React tree hierarchy can be just as important. You want to know not just that a &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; threw an error, but &lt;em&gt;where in the React tree&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To solve this, React 16 started printing “component stacks” when you have an error. Still, they used to be inferior to the native JavaScript stacks. In particular, they were not clickable in the console because React didn’t know where the function was declared in the source code. Additionally, they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12757&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;mostly useless in production&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike regular minified JavaScript stacks which can be automatically restored to the original function names with a sourcemap, with React component stacks you had to choose between production stacks and bundle size.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In React 17, the component stacks are generated using a different mechanism that stitches them together from the regular native JavaScript stacks. This lets you get the fully symbolicated React component stack traces in a production environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The way React implements this is somewhat unorthodox. Currently, the browsers don’t provide a way to get a function’s stack frame (source file and location). So when React catches an error, it will now &lt;em&gt;reconstruct&lt;/em&gt; its component stack by throwing (and catching) a temporary error from inside each of the components above, when it is possible. This adds a small performance penalty for crashes, but it only happens once per component type.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, you can read more details in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/18561&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this pull request&lt;/a&gt;, but for the most part this exact mechanism shouldn’t affect your code. From your perspective, the new feature is that component stacks are now clickable (because they rely on the native browser stack frames), and that you can decode them in production like you would with regular JavaScript errors.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The part that constitutes a breaking change is that for this to work, React re-executes parts of some of the React functions and React class constructors above in the stack after an error is captured. Since render functions and class constructors shouldn’t have side effects (which is also important for server rendering), this should not pose any practical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Finally, the last notable breaking change is that we’ve removed some React internals that were previously exposed to other projects. In particular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;React Native for Web&lt;/a&gt; used to depend on some internals of the event system, but that dependency was fragile and used to break.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In React 17, these private exports have been removed. As far as we’re aware, React Native for Web was the only project using them, and they have already completed a migration to a different approach that doesn’t depend on those private exports.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This means that the older versions of React Native for Web won’t be compatible with React 17, but the newer versions will work with it. In practice, this doesn’t change much because React Native for Web had to release new versions to adapt to internal React changes anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’ve removed the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;ReactTestUtils.SimulateNative&lt;/code&gt; helper methods. They have never been documented, didn’t do quite what their names implied, and didn’t work with the changes we’ve made to the event system.

        &lt;p&gt;We encourage you to try React 17.0 Release Candidate soon and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;raise any issues&lt;/a&gt; for the problems you might encounter in the migration. &lt;strong&gt;Keep in mind that a release candidate is more likely to contain bugs than a stable release, so don’t deploy it to production yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This blog site has been archived. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://react.dev/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;react.dev/blog&lt;/a&gt; to see the recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today we are releasing React 16.13.0. It contains bugfixes and new deprecation warnings to help prepare for a future major release.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 id=&quot;new-warnings&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#new-warnings&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Warnings &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;warnings-for-some-updates-during-render&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#warnings-for-some-updates-during-render&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Warnings for some updates during render &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A React component should not cause side effects in other components during rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is supported to call &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; during render, but &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-do-i-implement-getderivedstatefromprops&quot;&gt;only for &lt;em&gt;the same component&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you call &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; during a render on a different component, you will now see a warning:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;Warning: Cannot update a component from inside the function body of a different component.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This warning will help you find application bugs caused by unintentional state changes.&lt;/strong&gt; In the rare case that you intentionally want to change the state of another component as a result of rendering, you can wrap the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; call into &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;warnings-for-conflicting-style-rules&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#warnings-for-conflicting-style-rules&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Warnings for conflicting style rules &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When dynamically applying a &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; that contains longhand and shorthand versions of CSS properties, particular combinations of updates can cause inconsistent styling. For example: &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;toggle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;blue&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;red&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;red&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        ...
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You might expect this &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to always have a red background, no matter the value of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/code&gt;. However, on alternating the value of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/code&gt; between &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, the background color start as &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;red&lt;/code&gt;, then alternates between &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;transparent&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://codesandbox.io/s/serene-dijkstra-dr0vev&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;as you can see in this demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React now detects conflicting style rules and logs a warning.&lt;/strong&gt; To fix the issue, don’t mix shorthand and longhand versions of the same CSS property in the &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; prop.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;warnings-for-some-deprecated-string-refs&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#warnings-for-some-deprecated-string-refs&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Warnings for some deprecated string refs &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#legacy-api-string-refs&quot;&gt;String Refs is an old legacy API&lt;/a&gt; which is discouraged and is going to be deprecated in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;myRef&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(Don’t confuse String Refs with refs in general, which &lt;strong&gt;remain fully supported&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the future, we will provide an automated script (a “codemod”) to migrate away from String Refs. However, some rare cases can’t be migrated automatically. This release adds a new warning &lt;strong&gt;only for those cases&lt;/strong&gt; in advance of the deprecation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For example, it will fire if you use String Refs together with the Render Prop pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ClassWithRenderProp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;refs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;myRef&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ClassWithRenderProp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;myRef&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Code like this often indicates bugs. (You might expect the ref to be available on &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;ClassParent&lt;/code&gt;, but instead it gets placed on &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;ClassWithRenderProp&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You most likely don’t have code like this&lt;/strong&gt;. If you do and it is intentional, convert it to &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#creating-refs&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.createRef()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ClassWithRenderProp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To see this warning, you need to have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx-self&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx-self&lt;/a&gt; installed in your Babel plugins. It must &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be enabled in development mode. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you use Create React App or have the “react” preset with Babel 7+, you already have this plugin installed by default.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/docs/react-api.html#createfactory&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.createFactory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a legacy helper for creating React elements. This release adds a deprecation warning to the method. It will be removed in a future major version.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Replace usages of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;React.createFactory&lt;/code&gt; with regular JSX. Alternately, you can copy and paste this one-line helper or publish it as a library:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;createFactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; React&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; type&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It does exactly the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h3 id=&quot;deprecating-reactdomunstable_createportal-in-favor-of-reactdomcreateportal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#deprecating-reactdomunstable_createportal-in-favor-of-reactdomcreateportal&quot; aria-hidden class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deprecating &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;ReactDOM.unstable_createPortal&lt;/code&gt; in favor of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;ReactDOM.createPortal&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When React 16 was released, &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createPortal&lt;/code&gt; became an officially supported API.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, we kept &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;unstable_createPortal&lt;/code&gt; as a supported alias to keep the few libraries that adopted it working. We are now deprecating the unstable alias. Use &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;createPortal&lt;/code&gt; directly instead of &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;unstable_createPortal&lt;/code&gt;. It has exactly the same signature.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;React adds component stacks to its development warnings, enabling developers to isolate bugs and debug their programs. This release adds component stacks to a number of development warnings that didn’t previously have them. As an example, consider this hydration warning from the previous versions:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;

        alt=&quot;A screenshot of the console warning, simply stating the nature of the hydration mismatch: &quot;Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching div in div.&quot;&quot;

        &lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While it’s pointing out an error with the code, it’s not clear where the error exists, and what to do next. This release adds a component stack to this warning, which makes it look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This release contains a few other notable improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;In Strict Development Mode, React calls lifecycle methods twice to flush out any possible unwanted side effects. This release adds that behaviour to &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt;. This shouldn’t affect most code, unless you have side effects in &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt;. To fix this, move the code with side effects into &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;In Strict Development Mode, the warnings for usage of the legacy context API didn’t include the stack for the component that triggered the warning. This release adds the missing stack to the warning.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;onMouseEnter&lt;/code&gt; now doesn’t trigger on disabled &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ReactDOM was missing a &lt;code class=&quot;gatsby-code-text&quot;&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; export since we published v16. This release adds it back. We don’t recommend using it in your application logic, but it’s useful when debugging issues with mismatching / multiple versions of ReactDOM on the same page.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re thankful to all the contributors who helped surface and fix these and other issues. You can find the full changelog &lt;a href=&quot;#changelog&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
