        &lt;p&gt;WHAT IT IS The rise of agentic software development means code is being written, reviewed, and shipped faster than ever before across the entire industry. It also means that testing frameworks need to evolve for this rapidly changing landscape. Faster development demands faster testing that can catch bugs as they land in a codebase, without [...]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’re sharing details of the role backend aggregation (BAG) plays in building Meta’s gigawatt-scale AI clusters like Prometheus. BAG allows us to seamlessly connect thousands of GPUs across multiple data centers and regions. Our BAG implementation is connecting two different network fabrics – Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) and Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF). Once it’s complete our AI [...]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’re sharing a novel approach to enabling cross-device passkey authentication for devices with inaccessible displays (like XR devices). Our approach bypasses the use of QR codes and enables cross-device authentication without the need for an on-device display, while still complying with all trust and proximity requirements. This approach builds on work done by the FIDO [...]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp has adopted and rolled out a new layer of security for users – built with Rust – as part of its effort to harden defenses against malware threats. WhatsApp’s experience creating and distributing our media consistency library in Rust to billions of devices and browsers proves Rust is production ready at a global scale. [...]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’ve improved personalized video recommendations on Facebook Reels by moving beyond metrics such as likes and watch time and directly leveraging user feedback.  Our new User True Interest Survey (UTIS) model, now helps surface more niche, high-quality content and boosts engagement, retention, and satisfaction. We’re doubling down on personalization, tackling challenges like sparse user data [...]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Build a large enough website with a large enough codebase, and you’ll eventually find that CSS presents challenges at scale. It’s no different at Meta, which is why we open-sourced StyleX, a solution for CSS at scale. StyleX combines the ergonomics of CSS-in-JS with the performance of static CSS. It allows atomic styling of components [...]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We’re going behind the scenes of the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta’s most advanced AI glasses yet. In a previous episode we met the team behind the Meta Neural Band, the EMG wristband packaged with the Ray-Ban Display. Now we’re delving into the glasses themselves. Kenan and Emanuel, from Meta’s Wearables org, join Pascal Hartig on [...]&lt;/p&gt;
