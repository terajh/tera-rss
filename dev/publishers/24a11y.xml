        &lt;p&gt;A few years ago I didn&amp;#8217;t know what the term &amp;#8220;accessibility&amp;#8221; meant. I built Web sites that were partially inaccessible because I didn&amp;#8217;t know better. Fast forward to today, I know enough to be able to write, speak and run workshops on accessibility, helping others build more a accessible and inclusive Web. Much like everyone [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a web developer, or if you develop browsers or assistive technologies (AT), the following screenshot is probably familiar to you. It&amp;#8217;s the first part of the definition of the button element in the HTML specification. But wait&amp;#8230; what&amp;#8217;s that new section called “Accessibility considerations” doing there? There&amp;#8217;s a link “For authors” and a [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Long live the modern browser! Browsers are getting better these days. We seem to be in a golden age where there’s a never-ending stream of new features added for the benefit of the users accessing the page, and really great tools for those creating the page. It hasn’t always been the case, though. Earlier versions [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;There are no definites with color. Sure, you have your red, your green, and so on — but even that is relative. Try to describe a specific red color to a friend. Chances are the description will settle on, for example, is the color more of a brick-red or a fire truck-red? Describing a color [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;TL:DR; Jump straight to the recommendations In part 1 of this deep dive, we took a broad look at both how the native &amp;#60;select&amp;#62; element works across browsers and platforms, and the current state of accessible custom select component implementations. It’s necessary to look at how fragmented current select UX patterns are in order to [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If the web accessibility community were to somehow collectively agree on a single rallying cry, it could easily be “use native, semantic HTML elements.” This, like most things in accessibility, is an oversimplification, but it is a helpful one. As 2019 draws to a close, many of the popular component libraries (see: Material UI and [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

Any time a person with a disability interacts with the web, they may be unwittingly performing testing because so many websites are not fully accessible to everyone.

        &lt;p&gt;Zoey loves browsing the Internet. They enjoy getting lost in the interconnected web full of information, unraveling pieces of knowledge that are bookmark worthy. But they don&amp;#8217;t enjoy skimming through large bodies of text. They prefer pictures. A lot of them. They go through their crush&amp;#8217;s photos on Facebook before they even consider reading their [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You’ve heard of this inclusive design thing, and know that a11y is a numeronym for accessibility. It matters to you, and you try to make the people and projects around you better for it. But you’ve conquered the basics. Now what? I have good news to share: going beyond the basics isn’t as hard as [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Number 4 Will Give You a Seizure The title is written as a so-called clickbait title and meant as a tongue-in-cheek joke. Often clickbait titles deceptively present tips as a form of powerful secret knowledge. In this case, accessibility specialists don’t want you to know these tips because they’re bad practice. These are tips you [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I reference the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Success Criteria in my daily work. Recently, I looked back at how I have applied my interpretation to several success criteria and how I either misinterpreted them or was too aggressive in my interpretation. I’ve since studied the success criteria further and have discussed my interpretations [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;HTML is often underestimated – it isn’t complicated and it isn’t strict, and you can start producing results with just a handful of elements. It isn’t creative like CSS, or energetic like JavaScript, but it quietly teams up with the browser to make a lot of the web work – much more than many people [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest barriers to accessibility is awareness. We often hear how diversifying our workforce is good for business. I would like to examine why disabilities should be a part of that formula. When developers are tasked with making something accessible, chances are none of them has ever encountered someone with a disability, so [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
